### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:

  Option B is not relevant to the argument.
  Option C supports the argument.
  Option D weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for why people become well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters.
  Option E is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A is irrelevant as it does not address the impact of watching television on overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  Option B is also irrelevant as it talks about the likelihood of living in an area prone to natural disasters, not about the impact of watching television on overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  Option C strengthens the argument by stating that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of a natural disaster.
  Option D weakens the argument by stating that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  Option E is irrelevant as it talks about the likelihood of watching an above-average amount of television based on the area of residence, not about the impact of watching television on overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  A weakener would be a statement that undermines this claim.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the relationship between television and overestimating risks.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it does not address the relationship between television and overestimating risks.
  Choice C supports the argument, so it cannot be the correct answer.
  Choice D suggests that there are other ways to become well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters, which weakens the argument that television is the cause of overestimating risks.
  Choice E suggests that people who live in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch more television, which weakens the argument that television is the cause of overestimating risks.
  Therefore, the answer is either D or E.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The argument supports this claim by citing a study that found a correlation between watching an above-average amount of television and overestimating the risk of natural disasters.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics
Response 0:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument concludes that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results because the author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This is a fallacy of appeal to authority.
  The argument does not address the critics' main concern, which is the small sample size of the study.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the critics' main concern.
  The answer is not C because the argument does not solely focus on the study's author.
  The answer is not D because the argument does not address the critics' expertise.
  The answer is not E because the argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than the critics.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results because the author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This argument is vulnerable to criticism because it focuses on the author's reputation rather than the study itself.
  Therefore, the answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years, so the study's results should not be doubted.
  This argument is vulnerable to criticism because the author's reputation does not necessarily guarantee the accuracy of the study's results.
  The argument does not address the validity of the study's methodology or the reliability of the data collected.
  Therefore, the answer is not C or E.
  The argument does not make any claims about the behavior of lizards as a whole, so the answer is not A.
  The argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun, so the answer is not B.
  The argument does not address the expertise of the study's critics, so the answer is not D.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This is not a strong argument to support the conclusion that the study's results are not to be doubted.
  The argument does not address the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  The argument also does not address the criticism that the behavior of chameleons may not be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  The answer is not C or D because the argument does not focus on the study's author to the exclusion of the study itself, nor does it fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise.
  The answer is not E because the argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
  The answer is not B because the argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument concludes that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This is not relevant to the validity of the study's results.
  The study's sample size was very small, which is a valid criticism.
  The biologist argues that the behavior of six individual chameleons can be generalized to lizards as a whole, which is not necessarily true.
  The biologist does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This argument does not address the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  The answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that the study's conclusion is correct despite the small sample size.
  The argument supports this by stating that the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  However, the argument does not address the validity of the conclusion itself or the methodology of the study.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it focuses on the author's reputation rather than the study's methodology or validity.
  Choice C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument concludes that the critics of the study are wrong to doubt its results because the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  The argument does not address the critics' concern about the small sample size of the study.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the critics' concern about the small sample size of the study.
  Choice A is incorrect because the argument does not make any generalization about lizards as a whole.
  Choice B is incorrect because the argument mentions that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  Choice C is incorrect because the argument does not focus its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  Choice D is incorrect because the argument does not address the critics' expertise.
  Choice E is incorrect because the argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at the hospitals that implemented the plan to systematically record staff errors. The reason for the decrease is that the staff became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties due to the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored. To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports this reasoning.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
Option C weakens the argument because it states that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
Option D supports the argument by stating that the decrease in the incidence of injuries began only after the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  The argument concludes that the knowledge of being monitored made the staff more careful.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the conclusion.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option A suggests that the hospitals already had a policy of investigating life-threatening injuries, but it does not address the effect of the plan on the staff's behavior.
  Option D suggests that the decrease in injuries began only after the staff became aware of the monitoring, which supports the conclusion that the monitoring made the staff more careful.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan to record staff errors. The conclusion is that the knowledge of being monitored made the staff more meticulous. To strengthen the argument, we need to find a statement that supports the conclusion.

B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
C: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan was not comprehensive.
D: This statement supports the conclusion that the knowledge of being monitored made the staff more meticulous.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
The most suitable answer is D.

Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors has led to a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive enough.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a policy that was already in place before the implementation of the plan.
  Option D supports the argument by stating that the decrease in patient injuries did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. This suggests that the knowledge of being monitored was a significant factor in reducing staff errors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors has led to a decrease in patient injuries.

  Option D supports the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff's awareness of the monitoring of their errors.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that the knowledge of monitoring staff errors made the hospitals' staff more careful, which led to a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the monitoring of staff errors.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument by stating that not all staff errors were recorded.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
  Option A may be tempting, but it does not strengthen the argument because it talks about a policy that was already in place before the implementation of the plan.
  Option D directly links the decrease in patient injuries to the awareness of staff that their errors were being monitored.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that the systematic recording of staff errors led to a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries was indeed due to the systematic recording of staff errors.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument since it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument by stating that not all staff errors were recorded.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument since it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
  Option A and D are both plausible options that could strengthen the argument.
  Option A states that the hospitals already had a policy of investigating life-threatening staff errors, which implies that the hospitals were already cautious about staff errors. Therefore, the decrease in patient injuries could not have been due to the hospitals' pre-existing caution.
  Option D states that the decrease in patient injuries did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. This implies that the staff's awareness of the monitoring led to the decrease in patient injuries.
  Option D is more relevant to the argument since it directly links the decrease in patient injuries to the staff's awareness of the monitoring.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors led to a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the implementation of the plan.

  Answer choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Answer choice E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the implementation of the plan.
  Answer choice A is also irrelevant because it talks about a policy that existed before the implementation of the plan.
  Answer choice D supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff's awareness of the monitoring of their errors.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: The most important function of epic poetry is to transmit the values by which a group of people is to live. This transmission is accomplished not by an explicit discussion of those values, but rather by their embodiment in heroic figures, who are presented as role models. Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
Question: If the professor's statements are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: An important function of poetry is to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it.
  B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  C: When values are represented in poetry, they are rarely if ever set forth explicitly.
  D: For many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
  E: Only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models that, if imitated, give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear it.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values through heroic figures as role models.
  The question asks which statement must also be true.
  Statement A is too broad and not necessarily related to the argument.
  Statement B accurately reflects the professor's argument.
  Statement C is supported by the professor's argument.
  Statement D accurately reflects the professor's argument.
  Statement E is too extreme and not supported by the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by embodying them in heroic figures.
  The professor also argues that imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  Therefore, the answer must be a statement that is consistent with the professor's argument.
  Choice A is too broad and not specific to the argument.
  Choice C is too extreme and not necessarily true.
  Choice E is too extreme and not necessarily true.
  Choice B and D are consistent with the professor's argument.
  However, choice D is a more general statement that encompasses the argument made by the professor.
  Therefore, the answer is D: For many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values through heroic figures.
  The transmission of values is not done explicitly, but rather through the embodiment of those values in the heroic figures.
  The professor does not make any claims about other types of poetry or literature.
  Therefore, the correct answer must be related to the function of epic poetry and the embodiment of values in heroic figures.
  Choice B accurately reflects the professor's argument and is therefore the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values through heroic figures presented as role models.
  The question asks which statement must also be true.
  Statement A is related to the function of poetry in general, not specifically epic poetry.
  Statement B accurately reflects the professor's argument.
  Statement C is supported by the professor's argument that values are embodied in heroic figures rather than explicitly discussed.
  Statement D is also supported by the professor's argument that heroic figures serve as role models embodying values.
  Statement E is not supported by the professor's argument, as the professor only discusses epic poetry, not poetry in general.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The professor's statements suggest that epic poetry transmits values through heroic figures.
  The values are not explicitly discussed but embodied in the figures.
  The figures serve as role models for the people who hear the poems.
  Therefore, the correct answer must reflect the relationship between epic poetry, heroic figures, and values.
  Choice B accurately reflects this relationship.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values through heroic figures.
  The values are not explicitly discussed but embodied in the heroic figures.
  Imitating the role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  Therefore, the answer must be a statement that follows from the professor's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The professor states that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values through heroic figures.
  The professor also states that the values are not explicitly discussed but embodied in the heroic figures.
  Therefore, the correct answer must reflect the importance of heroic figures as role models for transmitting values.
  Choice A is too broad and does not mention heroic figures or values.
  Choice C is too extreme and uses the word "rarely if ever".
  Choice E is too extreme and uses the word "only".
  Choice B and D both reflect the importance of heroic figures as role models for transmitting values.
  However, choice D is a more general statement that applies to many groups of people, whereas choice B specifically mentions epic poetry.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The professor's statements suggest that epic poetry transmits values by embodying them in heroic figures.
  The professor also suggests that imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  Choice A is not necessarily true based on the information provided.
  Choice C is too extreme and not necessarily true based on the information provided.
  Choice D is consistent with the professor's statements and can be inferred from them.
  Choice E is too extreme and not necessarily true based on the information provided.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The professor states that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by which a group of people is to live.
  This transmission is accomplished by presenting heroic figures as role models, not by explicitly discussing the values.
  The professor's statements suggest that epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  Therefore, B must be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by embodying them in heroic figures.
  The professor also argues that imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  Therefore, the correct answer must reflect the idea that epic poems present heroic figures as role models that embody values and that imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  Answer B reflects this idea.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument in the advertisement is that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is based on a survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  The argument assumes that the survey is reliable and that the sample is representative.
  The argument does not address the possibility that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.

Response 2:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks some possibilities.
  Option A suggests that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  This criticism would weaken the argument because if some of the new policyholders did not save money, then the average savings of $250 a year may not apply to all policyholders.
  Therefore, the answer is A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events leading up to it.
The argument also rejects Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed.
To enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn, we need to find an assumption that links the two premises of the argument.
Option A is not relevant to the argument.
Option B is also not relevant to the argument.
Option C is restating the first premise of the argument.
Option D is not relevant to the argument.
Option E contradicts the argument.
Therefore, none of the options enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The argument is against Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn should support the idea that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice A is close, but it goes too far by saying that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. The argument is not about whether people should be praised or blamed for actions beyond their control, but rather about the conditions under which we can praise or blame someone for an action.
  Choice B is also close, but it is not specific enough. The argument is not just about whether others possess information about an act, but rather about whether we know a lot about the events that led to that act.
  Choice C is the opposite of the argument. The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. Choice C says that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we regard that action as freely performed.
  Choice D is also close, but it is not specific enough. The argument is not just about our inclination to blame or praise someone, but rather about the conditions under which we can praise or blame someone for an action.
  Choice E is also the opposite of the argument. The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. Choice E says that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
  Therefore, the best assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn is that people can only be praised or blamed for actions that we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The answer is B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
Response 2:

Option B is also not relevant to the argument.
Option C restates the argument, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
Option D is also not relevant to the argument.
Option E contradicts the argument of the ethicist.

Option B is also not relevant to the argument.
Option C restates the argument, but it does not support it.
Option D is also not relevant to the argument.
Option E contradicts the argument because the argument states that we can only praise or blame a person when we know a lot about the events that led to that action, not when we do not know much about those events.
Therefore, none of the options enable the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.

Option B is also irrelevant to the argument.
Option C is restating the argument and not an assumption.
Option D is also irrelevant to the argument.
Option E is opposite to the argument.

Response 5:
Thought:
The argument of the ethicist is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. 
The assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn should support the idea that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action is necessary to justify praise or blame.
Option A suggests that people should not be blamed for actions that were beyond their control, which is not directly related to the argument.
Option B suggests that the responsibility for an act is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, which is not directly related to the argument.
Option C supports the argument by stating that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed.

Option A suggests that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control, but this is not directly related to the argument of the ethicist.
Option B suggests that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, which is not in line with the argument of the ethicist.

  The assumption that would enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn would be one that supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice A is close, but it goes further than what the argument is saying. The argument is not saying that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. It is saying that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice B is also close, but it is not specific enough. The argument is not just saying that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.

  Choice E is the opposite of what the argument is saying. The argument is saying that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action. Choice E is saying that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed, which is not the same thing.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
Response 8:
Thought:
The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for their actions if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The conclusion is that Tolstoy's claim is false. 
To draw the conclusion, we need to assume something that supports the idea that we can only praise or blame someone for their actions if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. 
Option A is close, but it goes too far by saying that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. 
Option B is correct because it says that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This supports the idea that we can only praise or blame someone for their actions if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.

  The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  The argument also rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The assumption that would enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn is the one that supports the idea that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we regard that action as freely performed.
  Choice C states this assumption.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population can solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  To support this assertion, we need to find an option that shows that trading goods or services can solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  Option A talks about government subsidies to urban manufacturers, which is not related to the assertion made by the economists.
  Option B is too general and does not provide any specific support for the assertion made by the economists.
  Option C suggests that a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization, which supports the assertion made by the economists that trading goods or services can solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  Option D talks about problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas being primarily due to trade imbalances between countries, which is not related to the assertion made by the economists.
  Option E suggests that free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization, which does not support the assertion made by the economists.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the evidence provided by the physician.
  Option A suggests that the improvement in the condition of the patients could be due to the placebo effect.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain could have affected the results of the experiment.
  Option E weakens the evidence provided by the physician.

  To counter this argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the physician's conclusion.
  Option A suggests that the improvement in the patient's condition could be due to the placebo effect.
  Option B is irrelevant because the argument is not about comparing magnets to medication.
  Option C is irrelevant because the argument is about back pain, not pain in other areas.
  Option D is irrelevant because the scientists' beliefs do not affect the validity of the experiment's results.
  Option E suggests that the variation in the causes of the chronic back pain could have affected the results of the experiment.
  Option E weakens the physician's conclusion that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.

  Option A is a common phenomenon known as the placebo effect and does not necessarily weaken the physician's argument.
  Option B is an opinion and does not provide any evidence to weaken the physician's argument.
  Option C is irrelevant to the physician's argument as it talks about magnetic fields reducing pain in other areas.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the physician's argument as it talks about the scientists who helped design the experiment.
  Option E weakens the physician's argument as there was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment. This means that the reduction in pain in the first group may not be solely due to the application of magnets.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the surprising result?
Choices:
  A: For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
  B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
  C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.

  Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  To explain the surprising result, we need to find a reason why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  Option C provides a possible explanation for the surprising result.
  If customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, it suggests that the sale was the primary reason for their purchase.
  This means that the sale may not have been as effective in attracting customers who were not already planning to buy a hammer.
  Therefore, option C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  Choice A is not relevant to the situation.
  Choice B suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices, which contradicts the fact that Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Choice C suggests that customers bought Maxlast hammers because they were on sale, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Choice D suggests that the sale was advertised, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Choice E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, which may explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers despite the sale.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Option C suggests that customers bought Maxlast hammers because they were on sale.
  This suggests that the sale did not attract new customers to the store.
  Option D suggests that the hardware store advertised the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  This suggests that customers who came to the store were already aware of the sale.
  Therefore, the most likely explanation for the surprising result is that the sale did not attract new customers to the store.
  Option E supports this explanation by suggesting that a single item on sale is not enough to motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.

This suggests that the sale may have attracted customers who would not have otherwise bought a hammer, and they chose the Maxlast hammers because they were on sale. Therefore, the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers because the sale did not attract customers who would have otherwise bought the Styron hammers.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:

  The Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  We need to find a reason that explains why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Option C provides a reason that explains why the Maxlast hammers were sold last week.
  Option D provides information about the promotion of the sale.
  Option E provides a general statement about sales.

Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts or casts doubt on this claim.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it does not contradict the argument.
  Choice C is somewhat relevant, but it only says that documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances are uncommon, not that it is impossible or unlikely.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it only talks about fossils and not the current distribution of the species.
  Choice E, however, contradicts the argument by stating that numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana. This suggests that the iguana species on the islands could have existed in Australia before the fragmentation and then migrated to the islands later on.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

  The flaw in the editorialist's argument is that the studies conducted 30 years ago may not be relevant today because technology has advanced since then.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.

  C is not true because the passage suggests that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  D is not necessarily true because the passage does not provide information about the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in a blender.
  E is not relevant to the information provided in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage states that whipping cream in a blender results in a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream because the blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively.
  The passage also states that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  Therefore, A and B are true statements.
  C is not necessarily true because the passage states that using a special whipping-cream attachment can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  D is true because the passage states that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  E is not mentioned in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
Action: Answer("D")

  The passage states that using a blender to whip cream results in a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  The passage also states that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  Therefore, A is true.
  The passage does not state that the use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively, so B is false.
  The passage does not state that using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment, so C is false.
  The passage states that a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively, and that a special whipping-cream attachment can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake. Therefore, D is true.
  The passage does not provide information about the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream, so E is irrelevant.
  The correct answer is either A or D.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that a diet based on fish is healthier than one based on red meat.
  However, universal adoption of such a diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  The reasoning in option C is similar, which states that limiting purchases to what one truly needs is better.
  However, if everyone did this, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

  The argument states that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat.
  However, universal adoption of this diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  Option A discusses the safety of vitamin E supplements and concludes that we should not recommend everyone to take them.
  Option B discusses the impact of high taxes on tobacco on education funding.
  Option C discusses the impact of limiting purchases to what one needs on the economy.
  Option D discusses the reason why legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  Option E discusses the impact of restricting land development on wilderness areas.
  Option E is the closest to the argument above as it discusses the impact of preserving wilderness areas on the proliferation of species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:

  The argument states that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat.
  However, universal adoption of such a diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, the universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
  The argument is about a trade-off between health and environmental concerns.
  Option C is similar in that it discusses a trade-off between individual benefit and the greater good.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument presents a dilemma where a healthier diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  The argument concludes that universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
  Option A presents a similar dilemma where a vitamin E supplement is beneficial but not conclusively established as safe for all people.
  Option B presents a dilemma where high taxes on tobacco might reduce funding for education.
  Option C presents a dilemma where limiting purchases to what one needs is better but would throw the economy into a severe recession if everyone did it.
  Option D presents a dilemma where legislators need to campaign to get reelected but campaigning takes away from their job.
  Option E presents a dilemma where restricting land development in wilderness areas preserves species but reduces the proliferation of species in developed areas.
  Option A, B, C, D, and E all present dilemmas where there are two opposing outcomes.
  However, only Option A presents a dilemma where a beneficial action is not conclusively established as safe for all people.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Thought:
The employee argues that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not blocked. 
Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Both arguments point out that a single factor is not the sole determinant of success. 
Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Response 0:

Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  The correct answer choice will undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the prevalence of H pylori is much higher than that of M tuberculosis.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal despite its alleged benefits because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument then compares this to M tuberculosis, which also causes illness in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  To undermine this reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the two bacteria are not comparable in this way.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning, so it cannot be the answer.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E suggests that more people benefit from H pylori than suffer from it, which would support the idea that it is a commensal.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which does not provide any benefit to the people who harbor it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it compares the duration of tuberculosis to the duration of ulcers caused by H pylori, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning by stating that people who harbor M tuberculosis do not derive any benefit from its presence.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it does not address the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning by stating that there are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis, which suggests that the benefits of H pylori may outweigh its negative effects.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument then compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which does not provide any benefits to the people who harbor it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it talks about treatment, not the status of the bacteria as commensals.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about the duration of the diseases, not the status of the bacteria as commensals.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning that M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because it does not provide any benefits to the people who harbor it. Therefore, it does not undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it talks about the number of people who harbor the bacteria, not the status of the bacteria as commensals.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning because it shows that more people harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis, which means that even if H pylori causes stomach ulcers in some people, it still provides benefits to a larger number of people. Therefore, it weakens the argument's claim that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because it does not benefit people who harbor it.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that shows that the presence of H pylori does not benefit people who harbor it or that the presence of M tuberculosis does benefit people who harbor it.
  Choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which contradicts the argument's assumption that M tuberculosis cannot be a commensal because it does not benefit people who harbor it.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response and only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of people who harbor it.
  The argument supports this claim by comparing H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis in less than 10% of people who harbor it, but no one would call it a commensal.
  To undermine this reasoning, we need to show that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed.
  Choice C, which states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, undermines the argument's reasoning because it shows that M tuberculosis is not comparable to H pylori, which allegedly strengthens the immune response.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal even though it only causes tuberculosis in some people.
  The argument assumes that the only factor that determines whether a bacterium is a commensal is the percentage of people who get sick from it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that challenges this assumption.
  Choice C, which states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, challenges the assumption that the only factor that determines whether a bacterium is a commensal is the percentage of people who get sick from it.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal despite its alleged benefits because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal despite the fact that only 10% of people who harbor it get sick.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed.
  Choice C, which states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, undermines the argument's reasoning by showing that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.

  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument, so it cannot be the answer.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We need to find a statement that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  If the statement suggests that the polar bear had some advantage or help in returning to its home territory, then it would cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  This suggests that the polar bear was already familiar with the area and could have used its memory of the area to return home.
  Therefore, option B casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.

  We need to find an option that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory. This does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This supports the naturalists' claim and does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Option C suggests that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice. This does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Option D suggests that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances. This casts doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim because it suggests that the polar bear's ability to navigate over considerable distances is not unique to polar bears.
  Option E suggests that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory. This does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.

  We need to find an option that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory. This does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This also does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option C suggests that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice. This does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option D suggests that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances. This casts doubt on the validity of the evidence because it suggests that the polar bear's ability to navigate over considerable distances is not unique.
  Option E suggests that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory. This does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  The argument also claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument does not consider other factors that may contribute to colon cancer.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument, as the argument only focuses on the relationship between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not discuss the difficulty of including fiber in one's diet.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not compare the cancer-fighting properties of different types of fiber.
  Choice E is a possible criticism of the argument, as it suggests that other substances in foods containing fiber may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, rather than fiber alone.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
  However, leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for both.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it talks about how leatherbacks die in the wild, not about their life expectancy.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it talks about the difficulty of establishing an artificial environment for leatherbacks, not about their life expectancy.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it talks about the size of a leatherback, not about their life expectancy.
  Choice A is not helpful in resolving the discrepancy because it talks about the diseases that attack leatherbacks, not about their life expectancy.
  Choice B is the most helpful in resolving the discrepancy because it states that the average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals. This suggests that the leatherbacks' ability to reach their maximum life expectancy is not affected by the diseases they encounter in captivity.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  However, the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  Therefore, there must be something that offsets the susceptibility to diseases in captivity.
  Option C provides an explanation for the apparent discrepancy by stating that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  If this is true, then the susceptibility to diseases in captivity is offset by the reduced risk of predation.
  Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild.
  However, the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between the two statements.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a statement that explains why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both cases.
  Choice C provides a possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy by stating that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  If this is true, then the fatal diseases that leatherbacks are susceptible to in captivity may not be as deadly as the predators in the wild, which could explain why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both cases.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:

  Choice C provides a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
  If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then the ones that survive are less likely to die from diseases.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases, but they still have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the leatherbacks in captivity are not dying earlier than those in the wild.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not explain why leatherbacks in captivity are not dying earlier.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about the average life expectancy of sea turtles in general, not specifically about leatherbacks.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because it talks about the cause of death of leatherbacks in the wild, not about why leatherbacks in captivity are not dying earlier.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it talks about the knowledge of zoologists, not about the health of leatherbacks in captivity.
  Choice E is the most relevant because it suggests that the size of a leatherback is not a reliable indicator of its age, which means that the leatherbacks in captivity may not be younger than those in the wild, as previously assumed.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild.
  However, the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  The discrepancy is that one would expect the leatherbacks in captivity to have a lower likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy due to the fatal diseases they are susceptible to.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice C provides a possible explanation for this, as it suggests that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, not diseases.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  The argument also states that the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  There is a discrepancy between these two statements.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a statement that explains why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both cases.
  Choice C provides a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both cases.
  If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then the ones that survive are likely to live to their maximum life expectancy.
  Therefore, choice C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild, yet their likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both environments.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the susceptibility to fatal diseases does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  Choice C provides a possible explanation that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, not diseases.
  If this is true, then the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy, as the leatherbacks in the wild are also subject to other risks.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases, but they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the leatherbacks in captivity are not dying earlier than those in the wild.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is out of scope.
  Choice A and B do not help to resolve the discrepancy.
  Choice E could explain why the leatherbacks in captivity are not dying earlier than those in the wild. If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, then it is possible that the leatherbacks in captivity are not actually living as long as those in the wild, but they appear to be because their size is not a reliable indicator of their age.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild.
  However, the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between the two statements.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a statement that explains why the likelihood of reaching the maximum life expectancy is the same in both cases.
  Option C provides a possible explanation by stating that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  If this is true, then the fatal diseases that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to may not be as deadly as the predators in the wild.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Thought:

  The argument does not treat the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true.
  The argument does not take evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  The argument commits the error of describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports the publisher's prediction.
  Option B states that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  If it takes several weeks to complete the game, then players will have to rent the game multiple times.
  This will increase the revenue generated from rentals.
  As a result, the publisher's prediction that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations is justified.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that justifies the publisher's prediction.
  The game's rental sales are exceeding expectations.
  If the rental sales are high, it means that people are interested in playing the game.
  If people are interested in playing the game, they might want to purchase it after renting it.
  Therefore, an option that indicates that people are likely to purchase the game after renting it will justify the publisher's prediction.
  Option B is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option A, C, and E do not provide any evidence that people are likely to purchase the game after renting it.
  Option D indicates that most people do not play the game extensively after completing it, which means they might not be interested in purchasing it.
  Therefore, option D weakens the prediction.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find a statement that supports the prediction.
  The fact that the game can be purchased directly from the publisher or from retailers does not help to justify the prediction.
  The fact that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game does not help to justify the prediction.
  The fact that the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market does not help to justify the prediction.
  The fact that most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward does not help to justify the prediction.
  The fact that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend does not help to justify the prediction.
  Therefore, none of the choices help to justify the prediction.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find a statement that supports the publisher's prediction.
  The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers - This statement does not support the publisher's prediction.
  It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game - This statement does not support the publisher's prediction.
  The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market - This statement does not support the publisher's prediction.
  Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward - This statement does not support the publisher's prediction.
  Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend - This statement does not support the publisher's prediction.
  Therefore, none of the statements support the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports the prediction.
  Option A is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option B suggests that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, which means that they will have to rent the game multiple times before completing it, leading to more rentals and sales.
  Option C suggests that the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market, which means that the game is likely to be in high demand, leading to more sales and rentals.
  Option D suggests that most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, which is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option E suggests that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, which is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or C. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports the prediction.
  Option B states that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  If it takes several weeks to complete the game, then players will have to rent the game multiple times to complete it.
  This will increase the rental revenue for the publisher.
  As more people rent the game, the chances of them liking the game and purchasing it will also increase.
  Therefore, option B most helps to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the game will continue to be in demand.
  Option B suggests that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, which means that players will continue to rent or purchase the game to complete it.
  Therefore, option B most helps to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports this prediction.
  Option B states that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  This means that players who rented the game will have to rent it multiple times to complete it.
  This will encourage them to purchase the game instead of renting it multiple times.
  Therefore, option B most helps to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that people will buy the game after renting it.
  Option A is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option B suggests that people may take longer to complete the game, but it does not necessarily mean they will buy it.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option D suggests that people may not play the game extensively afterward, which may reduce the likelihood of them buying it.
  Option E suggests that some people may buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, which may increase the game's popularity and lead to more sales.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports the prediction.
  Option B states that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  If it takes several weeks to complete the game, then players will likely rent the game multiple times before completing it.
  This means that the publisher will earn more revenue from rentals before players purchase the game.

Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that humans would be just as content with six fingers if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.

  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B contradicts the biologist's argument.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D supports the biologist's argument, but it is not the most relevant to the argument.
  Choice E supports the biologist's argument by showing that having six phalanges in its fins is possible in fish.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the answer choice that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Answer choice A weakens the argument because it suggests that the accountants could have had the opportunity to embezzle.
  Answer choice B weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside the corporation could have had access to the internal financial records.
  Answer choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, so it is more likely that the embezzler is an accountant.
  Answer choice D weakens the argument because it suggests that the corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place, so it is possible that the embezzler was not an employee of the corporation.
  Answer choice E does not weaken the argument because it suggests that the actuaries may not have had access to the internal financial records, which supports the detective's argument that the embezzler is likely an actuary.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff. This answer choice weakens the argument because it suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, so it is more likely that the embezzler is an accountant.

  Option B weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside the company could have had access to the internal financial records.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that there were more accountants than actuaries, making it more likely that an accountant would have been the embezzler.
  Option D weakens the argument because it suggests that the company was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place, which could mean that an accountant had already embezzled money.
  Option E does not weaken the argument because it suggests that the actuaries had less access to the internal financial records than the accountants, which supports the detective's argument that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

  The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Choice A: Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. Therefore, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  Choice B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. Therefore, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  Choice C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Therefore, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  Choice D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine and did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  Choice E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves on Rodriguez's farm, and any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms means that a person has immunity to infection.
  The argument is similar to answer choice C, which assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This argument assumes that the only reason why people do not develop harmful symptoms is that they have an immunity to infection by staphylococcus.
  The argument fails to consider other reasons why people may not develop harmful symptoms.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is most similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in (C) Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The student's argument is that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms when exposed to a microorganism, then they have an immunity to that microorganism.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms means that there is immunity.
  The argument is similar to answer choice C, which assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The student argues that if many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, then they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms implies immunity to infection.
  The correct answer should describe a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Choice C is similar in that it assumes that the absence of a cure or alleviation of symptoms implies that the medication was not taken.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is equivalent to immunity.
  The correct answer choice will have a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Choice A is about the relationship between morality and serving the interests of everyone, which is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice B is about the persuasive intent of advertisers and writers of fiction, which is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice C is about the assumption that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice D is about the relationship between excessive taxation and business expansions, which is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice E is about the assumption that the frequency of hand washing by doctors is indicative of the value of the procedure in preventing disease, which is similar to the student's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms implies immunity to infection.
  The pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is most similar to option C, which assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that there are no other possible outcomes.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This argument is flawed because the premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion.
  Similarly, one of the choices must have a flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Choice A is flawed because it confuses moral rightness with serving the interests of everyone.
  Choice B is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  Choice C is flawed because it assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
  Choice D is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation.
  Choice E is flawed because it assumes that doctors not washing their hands often means that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in choice E is most similar to the student's argument.
Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need to find an option that explains why workers with less control over their work are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option A is irrelevant because it talks about the amount of typing done by workers with most and least control over their work.
  Option B is a possible explanation because emotional stress can lead to nerve disorders.
  Option C is irrelevant because it talks about the position of typists' arms and hands.
  Option D is irrelevant because it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards.
  Option E is a possible explanation because repetitive motions other than typing can also lead to nerve disorders.
  Between options B and E, option E is a better explanation because it talks about repetitive motions which is the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous, despite the fact that this drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy indicated above?
Choices:
  A: The drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available.
  B: The drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low.
  C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
  D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
  E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The argument is based on the computer models that showed Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the movement of raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The assumption required by the argument should be something that links the computer models to the conclusion.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not related to the argument.
  Choice D is the opposite of what the argument concludes.
  Choice E is related to the argument, but it is not necessary to assume that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
  Therefore, none of the choices is the assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  It also states that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus had to feed on plants that were accessible to it.
  None of the answer choices state this assumption.
  However, answer choice D comes closest to it by suggesting that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
  Therefore, I will select D as the answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not have raised its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument also states that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument should be related to Diplodocus's feeding behavior.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not related to Diplodocus's feeding behavior.
  Choice D is the opposite of what the argument suggests.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, none of the choices is the assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The argument is based on the fact that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented raising its very long neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is likely to be related to the conclusion.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Option C is not relevant to the argument.
  Option D is the opposite of what the argument concludes.
  Option E is a possibility that is not mentioned in the argument.
  None of the options seem to be the assumption required by the argument.
  However, option A is the most likely answer as it is the closest to the argument's conclusion.

  The assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus could not access high-growing vegetation in any other way.
  Choice D states this assumption.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

  Choice A is not related to the conclusion.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not related to the conclusion.
  Choice D is related to the conclusion, but it is not required by the argument.
  Choice E is related to the conclusion, and it is required by the argument. If Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then it could have fed on high-growing vegetation by accessing it from underwater.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument also states that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument should be related to the feeding habits of Diplodocus.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not related to the feeding habits of Diplodocus.
  Choice D is the opposite of what the argument states.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, none of the choices is the assumption required by the argument.

  Therefore, none of the choices is the assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is about the feeding behavior of Diplodocus.
  The computer models showed that Diplodocus's neck could not raise high enough to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The neck could bend downward and extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument should be related to the feeding behavior of Diplodocus.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is the opposite of what the argument suggests.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument, but it is not necessary for the conclusion.
  The assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus could not raise its neck high enough to browse for high-growing vegetation.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is that computer models have shown that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument then concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  An assumption required by the argument would be something that connects the conclusion to the premise.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is the opposite of what the argument is saying. The argument is saying that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument because it contradicts the conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The principle stated above says that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

  Option B talks about an offer made in jest, which is not legitimate, and thus the contract is not valid.
  Option C talks about a legitimate offer, but it does not mention anything about the offer being made in jest or the reasonableness of the offeree's belief.
  Option D talks about an offer that is not made in jest and is reasonable to believe as such, and thus if the offer is accepted, there is a valid contract.
  Option E talks about an offer that is not legitimate, but it does not mention anything about the offer being made in jest or the reasonableness of the offeree's belief.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The principle is used to determine whether an offer is legitimate or not.
  The argument that uses this principle must involve an offer that is either legitimate or not legitimate based on the principle.
  Option A is correct because it uses the principle to determine whether there is a valid contract or not.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A only talks about a legitimate offer and a lack of rejection, but it does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option B talks about an offer made in jest, which makes the contract not valid.
  Option C only talks about a legitimate offer and a reasonable person accepting it, but it does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option D talks about an offer that was not made in jest and a valid contract if accepted.
  Option E talks about a non-legitimate offer, but it does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Therefore, the principle stated above most helps to justify the reasoning in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option B is consistent with the principle stated above.
  Option C assumes that Frank's offer is legitimate and does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option D states that the offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, the contract is valid.
  Option E mentions that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. It does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Therefore, the principle stated above most helps to justify the reasoning in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The principle is used to justify the reasoning in one of the arguments.
  Option A states that there was a valid contract because Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. This argument does not use the principle stated above.
  Option B states that the contract was not valid because Gus made the offer in jest, which means that the offer was not legitimate. This argument uses the principle stated above.
  Option C states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate, and if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. This argument does not use the principle stated above.
  Option D states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. This argument uses the principle stated above.
  Option E states that there is no valid contract between Sal and Veronica because the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. This argument does not use the principle stated above.
  Therefore, the principle stated above most helps to justify the reasoning in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A is correct because Joe made a legitimate offer to Sandy and Sandy has not rejected the offer, so there is a valid contract.
  Option B is correct because Gus made the offer in jest, so the contract was not valid.
  Option C is incorrect because the principle does not state that Mindy will accept the offer if it is legitimate.
  Option D is correct because Hai's offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, so they have a valid contract.
  Option E is incorrect because it does not relate to the principle stated above.
  Therefore, the answer is either A, B, or D.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Option A is correct because it states that Joe made a legitimate offer to Sandy and Sandy has not rejected the offer, which means there was a valid contract.
Option B is correct because it states that Gus made the offer in jest, which means the contract was not valid.
Option C is incorrect because it assumes that Mindy will accept the offer if it is legitimate, but it does not address the issue of whether the offer is legitimate or not.
Option D is correct because it states that Hai's offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, which means they have a valid contract.
Option E is incorrect because it assumes that the only offer Sal made was not legitimate, but it does not address the issue of whether the offer was legitimate or not.
Therefore, the answer is either A, B, or D.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an answer that weakens this argument.
  If stretching before jogging does help to prevent injuries, then the researcher's argument is weakened.
  Answer E suggests that stretching can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
  This implies that stretching before jogging could help to prevent injuries.
  Therefore, answer E would most weaken the medical researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("E")

  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the researcher's conclusion.
  Option A provides additional information that supports the researcher's conclusion.
  Option B is irrelevant to the conclusion.
  Option C suggests that stretching may not be effective in preventing certain types of injuries, but it does not contradict the researcher's conclusion.
  Option D provides additional information that supports the researcher's conclusion.
  Option E suggests that stretching can be effective in preventing injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise, which contradicts the researcher's conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens the argument.
  Option A suggests that both groups of joggers had a lower rate of jogging injuries than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  This means that both groups of joggers are less prone to injuries than the general population.

  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A states that the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries for both groups of joggers compared by the scientists.
  This means that both groups of joggers are less prone to injuries than the general population of joggers.
  Therefore, the fact that both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries does not necessarily mean that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  Option A weakens the medical researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("A")

  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A suggests that both groups of joggers had lower rates of jogging injuries than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  This implies that both groups of joggers were less prone to jogging injuries than the general population.
  Therefore, the fact that both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries may not be significant.
  Option A weakens the medical researcher's argument.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is flawed because it assumes that the number of students in each major is equal, which may not be the case.
  Choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning where it assumes that the majority of the residents in Silver Falls are in favor of spending more on roads based on the fact that more residents said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than parks in an opinion poll.
  This conclusion is flawed because it assumes that the opinion poll is representative of the entire population of Silver Falls, which may not be the case.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is flawed because it assumes that the number of students taking the class is proportional to the number of majors in each discipline.
  Choice B is similar in that it assumes that the number of people in favor of increased spending on roads is proportional to the number of people opposed to spending more on parks.
Action: Answer("B")

  Choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning where the argument assumes that the majority of the residents are in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks, which is not necessarily true.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.

  The argument assumes that the number of students in each major is equal, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning where the argument assumes that the majority of the residents are in favor of spending more on roads, but it does not consider the possibility that the number of residents who were in favor of spending more on parks may still be significant.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.

  Choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning, as it assumes that the proportion of Silver Falls residents in favor of increased spending on roads is greater than the proportion of residents in favor of increased spending on parks, which may not be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class while most of the psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is not necessarily true because it is possible that there are more psychology majors than sociology majors overall.
  Choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning where the conclusion is drawn based on the fact that more people said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than parks in an opinion poll.
  However, this conclusion is not necessarily true because it is possible that the people who were in favor of spending more on roads were a minority but more vocal than those in favor of spending more on parks.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.

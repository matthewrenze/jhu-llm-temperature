### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement that if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, squirrels will eat from it and it will not attract many birds.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds.
  The flaw in reasoning is that the argument assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is because of squirrels eating from it.
  The argument does not consider other reasons why a bird feeder may not attract many birds.
  Choice E presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning by assuming that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure.
  The argument does not consider other reasons why a tire may wear out prematurely.
Action: Answer("E")

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds.
  The argument also presents another conditional statement: Squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The conclusion is not supported by the premises because it does not take into account the possibility that a bird feeder may not attract many birds for reasons other than the lack of a protective cover.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in option D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover based on the premise that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument assumes that the only reason a bird feeder would not attract many birds is because of squirrels eating from it.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is similar to the one that assumes that the only reason a tire would wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure.
  The answer is A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement that if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, then squirrels will eat from it and it will not attract many birds.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The conclusion is not justified by the premises because the argument only shows that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds if squirrels eat from it.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is similar to that in answer choice D because it presents a conditional statement and concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, without considering other possible causes.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The argument supports this conclusion by stating that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument assumes that the presence of squirrels is the only reason why a bird feeder would not attract many birds.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is similar to that in answer choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The evidence given is that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover, and if squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds.
  The flaw in the argument is that it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is because squirrels eat from it.
  Choice A is not similar because it does not have a similar flaw in reasoning.
  Choice B is not similar because it does not assume that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure.
  Choice C is not similar because it does not have a similar flaw in reasoning.
  Choice D is not similar because it does not assume that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure.
  Choice E is similar because it assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure, and ignores other possible causes.
  Therefore, the answer is E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer. Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement with two premises and a conclusion.
  The conclusion follows from the premises only if the premises are true.
  The premises are:
    1. Squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
    2. If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds.
  The conclusion is:
    3. A bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of a protective cover is the only reason why squirrels eat from a bird feeder.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is most similar to that in answer choice E.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find a statement that weakens the argument.
  If people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, then it weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find an option that weakens this claim.
  Option A does not address the impact of watching television on people's estimation of risks.
  Option B suggests that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, which does not weaken the argument.
  Option C suggests that people who watch less television have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of natural disasters, which supports the argument.
  Option D suggests that people who are well informed about the risks of natural disasters tend to get their information from sources other than television, which weakens the argument.
  Option E suggests that people who live in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch more television, which supports the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this claim.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument.
  Choice D weakens the argument by stating that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that contradicts this statement.
  Answer choice C states that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  This means that the amount of television watched does not necessarily affect people's perception of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
  Therefore, answer choice C weakens the reasoning above.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find an answer choice that weakens this argument.
  If people who watch a below-average amount of television also overestimate the risks of natural disasters, then the argument is weakened.
  Therefore, the answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that watching too much television leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find an answer that weakens this argument.
  If many people overestimate risks regardless of TV watching, then TV watching may not be the cause.
  If people who watch more TV are less likely to live in disaster-prone areas, then TV watching may not be the cause.
  If people who watch less TV have an accurate idea of the risks, then TV watching may not be the cause.
  If people who are well-informed about risks don't get their information from TV, then TV watching may not be the cause.
  If people who live in disaster-prone areas watch more TV, then TV watching may not be the cause.
  Only option A weakens the argument by suggesting that the overestimation of risks is not caused by TV watching.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than if they do not watch an above-average amount of television.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the amount of television people watch is not the cause of their overestimation of the risks of natural disasters.
  Answer choice A does not address the relationship between television and overestimation of risks.
  Answer choice B suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, which weakens the argument.
  Answer choice C suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television are more accurate in their estimation of the risks of natural disasters, which weakens the argument.
  Answer choice D suggests that people who are well informed about the risks of natural disasters do not become informed by watching television, which weakens the argument.
  Answer choice E does not address the relationship between television and overestimation of risks.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or C.
  However, answer choice B is more directly related to the argument and provides a more clear weakening of the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks is not as straightforward as the argument suggests.
  Answer choice A does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks.
  Answer choice B suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters, which weakens the argument.
  Answer choice C suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster, which weakens the argument.
  Answer choice D suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, which weakens the argument.
  Answer choice E suggests that people who live in an area that is prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch an above-average amount of television, which does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks.
  Answer choices B, C, and D weaken the argument, but answer choice B is the most direct in its weakening of the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find an option that weakens this claim.
  Option A does not address the relationship between television and overestimation of risks.
  Option B suggests that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, which does not weaken the argument.
  Option C suggests that people who watch less television have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of natural disasters, which strengthens the argument.
  Option D suggests that people who are well informed about natural disasters tend to become informed in ways other than watching television, which weakens the argument.
  Option E suggests that people who live in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch more television, which strengthens the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This option weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well informed about natural disasters do not rely on television for information.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  To weaken this argument, we need to show that there is no correlation between the amount of television watched and the overestimation of natural disaster risks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C strengthens the argument.
  Choice D weakens the argument by suggesting that there are other ways to become well-informed about natural disasters.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics
Response 0:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that the study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years, so the study's results should not be doubted.
  The argument does not address the sample size of the study, which is a potential weakness.
  The argument also does not address how the study's conclusion was reached.
  The argument does not make any claims about the behavior of chameleons being generalizable to lizards as a whole.
  The argument does not focus on the study's author over the study itself.
  The argument does not make any claims about the expertise of the study's critics.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the potential weakness of the study's small sample size.
  The answer is not among the choices. 
Action: None of the Above.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This argument is vulnerable to criticism because it relies on the authority of the author rather than the quality of the study itself.
  Therefore, the answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results because the author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This argument is vulnerable to criticism because the author's professional reputation does not necessarily guarantee the accuracy of the study's results.
  The argument is not vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole because the study specifically focuses on chameleons.
  The argument is not vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun because the argument states that the study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  The argument is not vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself because the argument acknowledges the small sample size of the study.
  The argument is not vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise because the argument does not rely on the critics' lack of expertise to support its conclusion.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that the study's results are valid despite the small sample size because the author is well-regarded and has done excellent work for years.
  The argument does not address the critics' concern about the small sample size.
  The argument also does not provide any evidence to support the conclusion that the behavior of chameleons is generalizable to lizards as a whole.
  The argument does not focus on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  The argument does not make any comparison between the standards held for the author and the critics.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the concern about the small sample size.
  The answer is not A, C, D, or E.
Action: Answer("B")

  The argument does not focus on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  The argument does not address the expertise of the study's critics.
  The argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
  Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the criticism that the sample size was small.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years, so the study's results should not be doubted.
  However, the study's small sample size is a weakness in the argument.
  The argument does not address the criticism that the sample size is too small to generalize the behavior of chameleons to all lizards.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the critics of the study are wrong to doubt its results because the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This argument is vulnerable to criticism because the author's professional reputation and past work do not necessarily guarantee the accuracy of this particular study.
  The argument does not address the small sample size of the study, which is a legitimate concern.
  Therefore, the answer is not A or B.
  The argument does not focus solely on the study's author; it does mention the study itself.
  The argument does not make any claims about the expertise of the study's critics.
  The argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than the study's critics.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This argument is vulnerable to criticism because the author's past work is not relevant to the current study.
  The argument also does not address the critics' concern about the small sample size.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or E.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument.
  Option B is not a criticism of the argument's reasoning.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the study's author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This argument is irrelevant to the conclusion that the study's results are not to be doubted.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant, but the subscription rate has increased dramatically.
  The argument concludes that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken the argument, we need to provide an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument.
  Choice D provides an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that the subscription rate a library pays for a scholarly journal has increased dramatically, while the cost of publishing a scholarly journal has remained constant, so publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the conclusion.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it talks about passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users, which is not related to the profitability of publishing a scholarly journal.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about the acquisition budget's representation of a university library's total operating budget, which is not related to the profitability of publishing a scholarly journal.
  Choice C supports the argument, so it is not the answer.
  Choice D contradicts the argument because it states that the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years, which means that the profitability of publishing a scholarly journal has not increased.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it talks about the frequency of publishing a scholarly journal, which is not related to the profitability of publishing a scholarly journal.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the claim that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the implementation of the plan.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument as it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument as it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
  Option A and D are both relevant to the argument.
  Option A suggests that the hospitals already had a policy of investigating life-threatening staff errors, which implies that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the implementation of the plan and not the previous policy.
  Option D suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff becoming aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
  Option D is more relevant to the argument as it directly supports the claim that the implementation of the plan resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors caused a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the implementation of the plan.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive enough.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
  Option A may weaken the argument because it suggests that the hospitals already had a policy in place to investigate life-threatening errors.
  Option D suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was a direct result of the staff becoming aware of the close analysis of the records.
  Therefore, Option D most strengthens the argument.
Action: Answer("D")

  Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan did not record all errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
  Choice A does not strengthen the argument because it talks about a policy that was in place before the plan was implemented.
  Choice D suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff becoming aware that their errors were being closely analyzed.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the systematic recording of staff errors reduced the number of patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the systematic recording of staff errors.

  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a different policy.
  Option D suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff becoming more careful after they were aware of the monitoring.
  This directly supports the argument that the knowledge of being monitored made the staff more careful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the implementation of the plan.
  Option A is irrelevant as it talks about a policy that existed before the implementation of the plan.
  Option B is also irrelevant as it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument as it states that not all staff errors were recorded.
  Option D supports the argument as it states that the decrease in patient injuries began only after the staff became aware of the close analysis of records.
  Option E is irrelevant as it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the implementation of the plan.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development should be regulated and offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The argument depends on an assumption.
  A is irrelevant to the argument.
  B is relevant because the argument assumes that replacement wetlands will be effective in protecting wildlife.
  C is irrelevant to the argument.
  D is relevant because the argument assumes that Figorian regulation has been effective in protecting wildlife in the past.

  Option A does not explain why the new highway increased average commute time.
  Option B does not explain why the new highway increased average commute time.
  Option C does not explain why the new highway increased average commute time.
  Option D does not explain why the new highway increased average commute time.
  Option E suggests that the new highway caused more traffic congestion in the downtown area, which could explain why the average commute time increased.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is about the justification for imposing a penalty for pollution.
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also states that we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  The argument implies that the penalty should not be imposed unless we are sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter.
  Therefore, the principle that most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument is discussing the severity of the penalty for the pollution infraction.
  The argument suggests that the penalty is severe enough that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to impose it.
  The argument is concerned with the justification for imposing the penalty.
  Choice A states that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing the penalty.
  This principle aligns with the reasoning in the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")

  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also states that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  The principle that would most help to justify the reasoning in the argument is the one that supports the idea that a penalty should only be imposed if there is sufficient evidence to justify it.
  Choice A supports this idea, stating that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is about whether the penalty for pollution should be imposed on the local auto repair shop without stronger evidence or admission of responsibility.
  The argument suggests that the penalty is so severe that it requires stronger evidence or admission of responsibility to justify imposing it.
  The principle that would most help to justify the reasoning in the argument is the one that supports the idea that a severe penalty requires stronger evidence or admission of responsibility before it can be imposed.
  Choice A best reflects this principle.
Action: Answer("A")

Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is about whether or not to impose a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river.
  The argument concludes that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, the penalty cannot be imposed.
  The reasoning is that the penalty is severe, and therefore, the identity of the polluter must be certain.
  The principle that would most help justify the reasoning in the argument is the one that supports the idea that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the certainty of guilt.
  Choice A best reflects this principle.
Action: Answer("A")

  The question is asking for a statement that must also be true based on the professor's statements.
  Statement B is true because the professor stated that epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values through heroic figures presented as role models.
  The question asks which statement must be true based on the professor's argument.
  Statement A is too broad and does not specifically relate to the professor's argument.
  Statement B accurately reflects the professor's argument that epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  Statement C is a possible inference from the professor's argument, but it is not necessarily true.
  Statement D accurately reflects the professor's argument that heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which people are to live.
  Statement E is too extreme and does not accurately reflect the professor's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values through heroic figures.
  The values are not explicitly discussed but embodied in the heroic figures.
  The embodiment of values in heroic figures serves as role models for people who hear the poems.
  Therefore, if the professor's statements are true, it must also be true that epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The professor states that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by which a group of people is to live.
  This transmission is accomplished by embodying values in heroic figures, who are presented as role models.
  Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  The question asks which statement must also be true based on the professor's statements.
  Statement B is a restatement of the professor's statements.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high.
  The reason is that the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  Therefore, the answer choice that supports the second group of doctors' position is the one that provides evidence that the brain's natural defenses are effective in preventing bilirubin from entering the brain.
  Answer choice B provides evidence that some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events leading up to it.
  The assumption required to draw the conclusion is that we can only regard an action as freely performed if we have enough information about the events leading up to it.
  Choice C states this assumption.
  Therefore, the answer is C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

The ethicist's argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action. 
The assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn should support the idea that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about the events leading up to any action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed. 
Option A is too extreme and goes beyond the scope of the argument. 
Option B is a restatement of the argument and does not provide any new information. 
Option C is a restatement of the argument and does not provide any new information. 
Option D is also too extreme and goes beyond the scope of the argument. 
Option E contradicts the argument because the ethicist claims that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action. 
Therefore, none of the options enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Thought:
The argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The conclusion is that Tolstoy's claim that we would cease to regard that action as freely performed if we knew a lot about the events leading up to it is false. 
To draw the conclusion, we need to assume that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily mean that the action was not freely performed.
Option A is irrelevant to the conclusion.
Option B is a possible assumption, but it does not directly support the conclusion.
Option C is a restatement of the premise, not an assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn.
Option D is also irrelevant to the conclusion.
Option E contradicts the premise of the argument.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.

  The assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn must support the idea that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice A is close, but it goes too far by saying that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. The argument is not about whether people should be blamed or praised for actions beyond their control, but about whether we can justifiably blame or praise someone for an action when we do not know much about the events leading up to that action.
  Choice B is also close, but it is not specific enough. The argument is not about whether an act is genuinely the responsibility of the person doing it, but about whether we can justifiably praise or blame someone for that act when we do not know much about the events leading up to it.
  Choice C is the correct answer. It supports the idea that we can only be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action if we regard that action as freely performed.
  Choice D is incorrect because it suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E is incorrect because it suggests that we will regard an action as freely performed if we do not know much about the events leading up to it, which is not necessarily true.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population for agricultural products can solve the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
  To support this assertion, we need a statement that shows that trading goods or services for agricultural products is a viable solution.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the assertion.
  Choice B is too general and does not address the specific issue.
  Choice C supports the assertion by stating that agricultural products are scarce due to urbanization, which implies that trading for agricultural products is a viable solution.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the assertion.
  Choice E contradicts the assertion by stating that free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The pharmacist argues that a study showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  The pharmacist then concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  The argument seems to be flawed in that it is making a causal claim based on a correlation.
  Just because melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms does not necessarily mean that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  Therefore, the answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The pharmacist argues that melatonin supplements are effective in alleviating insomnia symptoms.
  The pharmacist also argues that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct.
  The claims are that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  The pharmacist's argument is flawed because the study only shows that melatonin supplements are effective in alleviating insomnia symptoms, but it does not prove that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  Therefore, the pharmacist's argument confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  To counter this argument logically, we need to find a statement that weakens the physician's conclusion.
  Choice A suggests that the improvement in the first group could be due to the placebo effect.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain could have affected the results of the experiment.
  Choice E weakens the physician's conclusion by suggesting that the results of the experiment could be due to the variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  We need to find the answer that most strongly counters the physician's argument.
  A: This answer suggests that the improvement in pain reported by the patients in the first group could be due to the placebo effect, rather than the magnetic fields.
  B: This answer is irrelevant to the physician's argument about magnetic fields being effective at relieving back pain.
  C: This answer is irrelevant to the physician's argument about magnetic fields being effective at relieving back pain.
  D: This answer is irrelevant to the physician's argument about magnetic fields being effective at relieving back pain.
  E: This answer suggests that the improvement in pain reported by the patients in the first group could be due to differences in the specific causes of their back pain, rather than the magnetic fields.

Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the survey respondents were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Answer choice B suggests that the live audience watching the debate thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. This means that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been biased in favor of Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B does not undermine the argument because the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been part of the live audience.
  Option C does not undermine the argument because it does not address the bias of the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better.
  Option D strengthens the argument because it suggests that Tanner was more popular before the debate.
  Option E does not undermine the argument because it does not address the bias of the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  If most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Therefore, A could undermine the argument.
  If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then the argument would be strengthened.
  Therefore, B does not undermine the argument.
  If the people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate, then the argument would be strengthened.
  Therefore, C does not undermine the argument.
  If most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner, then the argument would be strengthened.
  Therefore, D does not undermine the argument.
  If Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin, then the argument would be strengthened.
  Therefore, E does not undermine the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the connection between the survey respondents' bias and Lopez's eventual victory.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument, but rather supports it.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D does not weaken the argument, but rather supports it.
  Choice E weakens the argument because if Lopez won the election by a very narrow margin, then it is unlikely that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were biased in favor of Lopez.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that the survey respondents were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of bias.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it only talks about the live audience, not the survey respondents.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because it talks about the voting behavior of people who watched the debate, not the bias of the survey respondents.
  Choice D strengthens the argument because it suggests that the survey respondents were biased in favor of Tanner, not Lopez.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it does not address the issue of bias.
  Therefore, the best answer is A because it suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez because most people who voted in the election did not watch the debate.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that suggests the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not helpful to the argument because it only talks about the live audience, not the survey respondents.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E suggests that Lopez won the election by a very narrow margin, which means that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been biased in favor of Lopez, and that Lopez's victory may have been due to factors other than the televised debate.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not necessarily biased in favor of Lopez.
  Choice B suggests that most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, which contradicts the survey results.
  Therefore, choice B most seriously undermines the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that the survey respondents were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B does not undermine the argument, as the survey respondents may have had a different opinion from the live audience.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D does not undermine the argument, as the viewers' opinions could have changed after watching the debate.
  Choice E supports the argument, as it suggests that Lopez's victory was not overwhelming and that the survey respondents may have been biased in his favor.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the survey respondents were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Answer choice B suggests that most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  This answer choice suggests that the survey respondents were not biased in favor of Lopez and that their assessment of the debate was not influenced by the fact that Lopez eventually won the election.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is a possible counter-argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D is irrelevant because it refers to the viewers' opinions before the debate.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The new computer program counts the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in Country X.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the number of paychecks issued in the first quarter for which the program was used would be greater than the number of people employed.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The new program counts the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the new program would count more paychecks than the number of people employed.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed.
  Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The new computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses/commissions.
  Therefore, the number of paychecks issued may not accurately reflect the number of people employed.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  This increase may be due to the fact that some employees received multiple paychecks.
  Therefore, the government may have overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The new computer program counted the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the number of paychecks per pay period would be higher than the number of people employed.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Thus, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The new computer program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the number of paychecks issued in the first quarter would be higher than the preceding quarter, even if the number of people employed remained the same.
  The government reported that there was a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The government used a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in Country X.
  The program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the new program may have counted multiple paychecks for the same employee and overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this claim.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B does not contradict the argument, but it suggests that the iguana species on the islands may have evolved differently from those found in the Americas.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D suggests that the iguana species on the islands may have originated from Australia, not the Americas, which contradicts the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an option that contradicts this argument.
  Options A, B, and D do not contradict the argument.
  Option C is not relevant to the argument.
  Option E suggests that the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, which means that the iguanas could have existed in Australia before the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  Therefore, option E weakens the scientist's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands came from the Americas via rafting on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this explanation.
  Choice A does not contradict the argument.
  Choice B does not contradict the argument.
  Choice C is not strong enough to weaken the argument.
  Choice D contradicts the argument by suggesting that the iguana species on the islands may have come from Australia instead of the Americas.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this idea.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it talks about other animal species, not iguanas.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument because it only states that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, but it does not contradict the idea that they rafted across the Pacific.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because it talks about the frequency of documented cases of iguanas rafting, not about the specific case of the iguanas on the islands.
  Choice D weakens the argument because it suggests that the progenitors of the iguana species on the islands could have come from Australia, not from the Americas.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it talks about other plant and animal species, not iguanas.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands came from the Americas.
  The argument is weakened if there is evidence that contradicts this claim.

  C is irrelevant to the claim.
  E is also irrelevant to the claim.
  Therefore, none of the choices weaken the scientist's argument.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands came from the Americas by rafting on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean.
  If there are other possible explanations for the presence of the iguana species on the islands, then the scientist's argument would be weakened.
  A, B, and D are not relevant to the argument.
  C is not a strong enough statement to weaken the argument.
  E suggests that the iguana species may have existed on the islands before the fragmentation of Gondwana, which would weaken the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.

  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B does not contradict the argument, but it suggests that the iguana species on the islands may have evolved differently from those in the Americas.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D weakens the argument because it suggests that the iguana species may have originated in Australia rather than the Americas.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts or casts doubt on this argument.
  Choice A does not weaken the argument because the argument is only about the iguana species, not all animal species on the islands.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument because genetic differences do not necessarily mean that the species did not originate from the Americas.
  Choice C does not weaken the argument because the argument does not rely on documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances.
  Choice D strengthens the argument by suggesting that the iguana species may have originated from Australia, not the Americas.
  Choice E weakens the argument by suggesting that the iguana species may have existed in the region prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, and therefore did not need to raft across the Pacific Ocean.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana. 
Action: Answer("E")

Thought:
The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana. 
To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this reasoning.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B does not contradict the argument, but rather supports the idea of genetic differences between the iguana species.
Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
Option D supports the argument by stating that fossils of closely related iguana species have been found in Australia.
Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
Therefore, the best answer is A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas. This statement suggests that the iguanas may have come from somewhere else, not necessarily the Americas, weakening the scientist's argument that they must have rafted on floating debris from the Americas.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument does not address whether the injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  The argument does not address whether there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
  The argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  The argument does not conclude that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
  The argument does not take statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  The answer is A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions occur on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
  The argument assumes that the bicycle lanes are the cause of the increased collisions.
  However, there could be other factors that contribute to the increased collisions.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it does not consider alternative explanations for why more collisions occur on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
  Choice B is a possible criticism, but it does not address the main vulnerability of the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is not an accurate description of the argument.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions occur on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
  The argument does not consider other factors that may contribute to the higher number of collisions on roads with bicycle lanes.
  Choice A addresses the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B addresses the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C addresses the assumption that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D addresses the possibility that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E addresses the use of statistical evidence to support a conclusion that is not supported by the evidence.
  Therefore, the answer is E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. 
The argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address other factors that could affect the number of collisions, such as the behavior of drivers and bicyclists, the quality of the road surface, and the visibility of the bicycle lanes.
Option A is not relevant to the argument.
Option B may be a factor, but it does not address the argument's main point.
Option C is not relevant to the argument.
Option D is not relevant to the argument.
Option E is the most relevant criticism because the argument uses statistical evidence to support a conclusion that is not necessarily supported by the evidence.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions occur on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
  The argument assumes that the bicycle lanes themselves are the cause of the collisions.
  However, the argument does not consider other factors that could contribute to the higher number of collisions on roads with bicycle lanes.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
  The answer is B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks other factors that could contribute to the higher number of collisions on roads with bicycle lanes.
  Option A addresses this vulnerability by suggesting that the injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes could be as serious as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  Therefore, the answer is A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("A")

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that a fish-based diet is healthier than a red meat-based diet.
  However, universal adoption of such a diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  The argument is about a trade-off between health and the environment.
  Option C is similar in that it also discusses a trade-off between individual benefit and a larger negative impact.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that a fish-based diet is healthier than a red meat-based diet.
  However, universal adoption of this diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  Option A discusses the safety of vitamin E supplements and concludes that we should not recommend everyone to take them.
  Option B discusses the potential consequences of high taxes on tobacco and the need for alternative sources of revenue.
  Option C discusses the benefits of limiting purchases and saving income, but the negative consequences of everyone doing so.
  Option D discusses the reason why legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  Option E discusses the trade-off between preserving wilderness areas and reducing the proliferation of certain species.
  Option E is the most similar to the argument above in that it discusses the trade-off between two desirable outcomes.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument presents a situation where a healthier diet based on fish protein would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  The argument concludes that we should not recommend universal adoption of such a diet.
  Option A presents a similar argument where taking vitamin E supplements every day reduces the risk of heart attack, but it has not been established that it is safe for all people. Therefore, we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  Option B presents a different argument about the potential consequences of taxing tobacco heavily and spending the revenue on education.
  Option C presents a similar argument where limiting purchases to what one truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income is better for the consumer. However, if everyone did this, it would throw the economy into a severe recession, making saving and investing impossible for most people. Therefore, we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  Option D presents a different argument about the amount of time legislators spend campaigning.
  Option E presents a similar argument where restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve many species, but it also reduces the proliferation of species that flourish in developed areas.
  Option A is the most similar argument to the one presented in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument presents a situation where a healthier diet based on fish protein would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  The argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  Option A presents a situation where taking vitamin E supplements reduces the risk of heart attack, but it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people.
  Option B presents a situation where governments tax tobacco heavily and spend the revenue on education, but if the taxes become too high, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding generated for education.
  Option C presents a situation where limiting purchases to what one truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income is better for the consumer, but if everyone did this, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people.
  Option D presents a situation where legislators spending less time campaigning would have more time to do their jobs, but if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected.
  Option E presents a situation where restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve many species that now inhabit these areas, but it also reduces the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species that flourish in developed areas.
  Option C presents a situation that is similar to the argument above, where a spending pattern that is better for the consumer would lead to a severe recession if everyone adopted it.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument presents a dilemma where a healthy diet based on fish protein would lead to the extinction of marine species if universally adopted.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  Option A presents a similar dilemma where vitamin E supplements are beneficial for reducing the risk of heart attack but not conclusively established as safe for all people.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  Option B presents a dilemma where heavy taxes on tobacco generate revenue for education, but too high taxes might reduce smoking and the funding generated for education.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  Option C presents a dilemma where limiting purchases to what one needs and saving or investing any remaining income is better for the consumer, but if everyone did this, it would throw the economy into a severe recession, making saving and investing impossible for most people.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  Option D presents a reason why legislators spend so much time campaigning, which is to get reelected.
  Option E presents a dilemma where restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve many species, but it also reduces the proliferation of species that flourish in developed areas.
  Therefore, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
  Option A, B, and C present dilemmas where a beneficial action might lead to undesirable consequences if universally adopted.
  However, only option C presents a dilemma that is similar to the argument above.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
The argument states that a diet whose protein comes from fish is healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat.
If everyone adopts this diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible.
Therefore, the universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
Option A discusses the safety of vitamin E supplements and concludes that it should not be recommended for everyone.
Option B discusses the impact of high taxes on tobacco and how it might reduce funding for education.
Option C discusses the spending pattern of consumers and how it might lead to a severe recession if everyone follows it.
Option D discusses the reason why legislators spend so much time campaigning.
Option E discusses the impact of restricting land development in wilderness areas on the proliferation of species.
Option A, B, C, D are not similar to the reasoning in the argument above.
Option E is similar to the argument above as it discusses the impact of a particular action on the proliferation of species.
Therefore, the answer is E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument presents a situation where a healthier diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  The extinction of marine species would make the diet impossible.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that the universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
  Choice C presents a similar argument where a spending pattern that benefits an individual would cause a severe recession if everyone adopted it.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that a diet based on fish is healthier than one based on red meat.
  If everyone adopted this diet, it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, universal adoption of this diet should not be recommended.
  The reasoning in option C is similar as it suggests that a spending pattern that is better for an individual may not be good for the economy as a whole.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument states that a diet with fish protein is healthier than one with red meat protein.
  However, if everyone adopts this diet, most marine species will become extinct, making it impossible.
  Therefore, the universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
  The argument is about the trade-off between health and environmental impact.
  Option C is similar as it talks about the trade-off between individual benefit and the impact on the economy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat.
  If everyone adopted this diet, it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, the universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
  The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
  Option A discusses the safety of vitamin E supplements and recommends not recommending them to everyone.
  Option B discusses the potential impact of high taxes on tobacco and the need for alternative sources of revenue.
  Option C discusses the impact of everyone limiting their purchases on the economy and recommends not recommending this spending pattern to everyone.
  Option D discusses the relationship between campaigning and reelection for legislators.
  Option E discusses the impact of restricting land development on wilderness areas and the proliferation of species.
  Option E is similar to the argument above in that it discusses the impact of a certain action on the proliferation of species.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Thought:
The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as a decorated office or a window, are not banned. 
Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a successful novel because publishers and agents may reject manuscripts that focus too much on character. 
Choice D is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software blocks access to non-work-related websites, claiming that it distracts employees from doing their best work. However, offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room. 
  Choice D argues that aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. However, this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale. Publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
  Both arguments present a condition that is not sufficient to guarantee a certain outcome. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.

But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software blocks access to non-work-related websites, but offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too. The employee is pointing out that just because something can be distracting, it does not mean it should be banned.
  Choice D argues that just because engaging characters do not guarantee a sale, it does not mean that they should not be emphasized in creative writing classes.
  Therefore, Choice D is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not the only source of distraction, and that other sources of distraction are not being addressed.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters is not the only factor in getting published, and that other factors are also important.
  Therefore, the employee's argument is most similar in its reasoning to choice D.
  The answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because not all distractions are eliminated and not all distractions are bad.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a successful novel because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  Both arguments acknowledge that a single factor does not guarantee a desired outcome.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because there are other distractions in the workplace that are not being addressed.
  The argument must be similar in reasoning.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale.
  This is similar because just as engaging characters do not guarantee a sale, blocking non-work-related websites does not guarantee better work.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software blocks access to non-work-related websites, but offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room. 
  The argument is that the company's reasoning for blocking non-work-related websites is flawed because it fails to take into account other potential distractions.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

  The study found that the level of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  We need to find an option that explains why the level of nicotine in the blood is the same at the end of the day, regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes.
  Option A is incorrect because it talks about the maximum amount of nicotine that can be absorbed by the blood, which is not relevant to the question.
  Option B is also incorrect because it talks about the number of cigarettes smoked and not the nicotine level in the cigarettes.
  Option D is also incorrect because it talks about the level of tar in cigarettes, which is not relevant to the question.
  Option E is also incorrect because it talks about the decrease in nicotine level when smoking is discontinued, which is not relevant to the question.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: Option C explains that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities. This means that even if a smoker smokes low-nicotine cigarettes, they will still absorb most of the nicotine into their bloodstream. Therefore, the level of nicotine in the blood is the same at the end of the day, regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If grain prices double then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.

  Therefore, the answer is D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling while the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double.
  To explain this, we need to find a statement that differentiates the production and sale of beef from that of bread.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the phenomenon described.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the phenomenon described.
  Choice C may explain why the cost of producing beef is higher than that of producing bread, but it does not explain why the price of beef will come close to doubling while the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double.
  Choice D may explain why the price of beef will come close to doubling if grain prices double, but it does not explain why the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double.
  Choice E also does not explain the phenomenon described.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that grain-fed beef prices come close to doubling when grain prices double, while the average price of a loaf of bread rises between 10 and 15 percent.
  The question asks which statement would most contribute to an explanation of this phenomenon.
  Option B is irrelevant because it compares the wholesale price of beef to the wholesale price of bread, but the phenomenon is about the effect of grain prices on the prices of bread and beef.
  Option C is also irrelevant because it talks about the cost structure of producing bread and beef, but the phenomenon is about the effect of grain prices on the prices of bread and beef.
  Option A and E are also irrelevant because they don't provide any information that explains the phenomenon.
  Option D, however, provides a possible explanation for the phenomenon because it suggests that most of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grain rather than grass, which means that the cost of feeding cattle represents a significant portion of the cost of producing beef. Therefore, when grain prices double, the cost of producing beef increases significantly, which leads to a close to doubling of beef prices.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal despite its alleged benefits because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample, stating that it cannot be considered a commensal despite the fact that only 10% of people who harbor it get sick.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Choice C, which states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, undermines the argument's reasoning by showing that the two bacteria are not comparable in terms of their relationship with the human body.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal despite the fact that only 10% of people who harbor it get sick.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that there is a flaw in the reasoning.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it compares the duration of tuberculosis to ulcers, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning, so it cannot be the correct answer.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that H pylori is more common than M tuberculosis, which means that even if only a small percentage of people get sick from H pylori, it could still be considered a commensal in a larger number of people.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal despite its alleged immune-strengthening benefits because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis is not a commensal despite the fact that only 10% of people who harbor it get sick.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that shows that the reasoning is flawed.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the prevalence of H pylori is much higher than that of M tuberculosis, which means that even if only 10% of people who harbor H pylori get stomach ulcers, the number of people affected could still be much higher than the number of people affected by M tuberculosis.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal despite allegedly strengthening immune response and causing ulcers in less than 10% of those who harbor it.
  The argument uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample, stating that only 10% of those who harbor it get sick from it, yet no one would call it a commensal.
  To undermine this reasoning, we need to find a statement that weakens the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice C, which states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, weakens the comparison between the two bacteria because it suggests that M tuberculosis is not a commensal, whereas H pylori allegedly strengthens immune response.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in a significant proportion of people.
  The argument compares H pylori with M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  The correct answer should undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the prevalence of H pylori is much higher than that of M tuberculosis, which could explain why H pylori is considered a commensal.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis should not be considered a commensal despite causing tuberculosis in only a small percentage of people.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that challenges this reasoning.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E challenges the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the prevalence of H pylori is much higher than that of M tuberculosis, which could explain why H pylori is considered a commensal while M tuberculosis is not.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample, since only 10% of people who harbor it get sick, but no one would call it a commensal.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which suggests that the comparison is not valid since H pylori is alleged to strengthen immune response.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response and only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of people who harbor it.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal, even though only about 10% of people who harbor it get sick from it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows why H pylori is more like a commensal than M tuberculosis.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning that M tuberculosis is not a commensal, but it does not undermine the argument's reasoning that H pylori is not a commensal.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E supports the argument's reasoning that H pylori is more like a commensal than M tuberculosis.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The counterargument is that only a small percentage of people with H pylori get stomach ulcers, and it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The analogy is made to M tuberculosis, which only causes tuberculosis in a small percentage of people who harbor it.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a difference between H pylori and M tuberculosis that makes the analogy less relevant.
  Choice C is a clear difference: people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, while H pylori allegedly strengthens immune response.
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  It also claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument does not consider other factors that may affect colon cancer rates.
  Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B may strengthen the argument, but it is not a criticism of the argument.
  Choice C may be a valid criticism, but it is not the best answer.
  Choice D is a possible criticism, but it is not the best answer.
  Choice E is the best answer because it suggests that other substances in foods containing fiber may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, not just fiber.
Action: Answer("E")

  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  It also claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument does not address the possibility that there are other factors that contribute to colon cancer, such as genetics or lifestyle.
  Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that there are other factors that contribute to colon cancer.
  Choice B is tempting, but it does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument uses evidence of the correlation between high-fiber diets and lower colon cancer rates in non-Western countries and Scandinavia.
  The argument does not address the possibility that there are other factors that contribute to the correlation.
  Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that there are other factors that contribute to the correlation.
  Choice B is not relevant because it does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C is not relevant because it does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is not relevant because it does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E is a possible criticism because it suggests that the correlation between high-fiber diets and lower colon cancer rates could be due to other substances in the foods that contain fiber.
  However, the argument does not overlook this possibility because it claims that "sufficient consumption of fiber prevents [colon cancer]," which implies that fiber is the main factor.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably, which suggests that the correlation between high-fiber diets and lower colon cancer rates could be changing over time.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer.
  The argument provides evidence that colon cancer rates are lower in countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  The argument also states that the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  The discrepancy is that one would expect the leatherbacks in captivity to have a lower likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy due to the fatal diseases they are susceptible to.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice C provides a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy, despite the fact that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why this is the case.
  Choice A, B, D, and E do not provide any explanation for the discrepancy.
  Choice C suggests that the leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, not by diseases.
  If this is true, it would explain why leatherbacks in the wild and in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  The argument also states that the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  There is a discrepancy between the two statements.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice C provides a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then the fatal diseases that leatherbacks are susceptible to in captivity do not play a significant role in reducing their life expectancy in the wild.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity but still have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  The discrepancy can be resolved if there is a reason why the fatal diseases do not affect the leatherbacks' life expectancy in captivity.
  Option C suggests that the fatal diseases that affect leatherbacks in captivity are not present in the wild, which would explain why the life expectancy is the same in both environments.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not face in the wild, yet they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the statement in the argument is true.
  Option C provides a reason why the statement in the argument is true. If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then it is possible that the ones that survive are less susceptible to fatal diseases.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild, yet they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the life expectancy is the same in both cases.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B talks about the life expectancy of sea turtles in general, which is not helpful in resolving the discrepancy.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D talks about the difficulty of establishing an artificial environment for leatherbacks, but it doesn't explain why the life expectancy is the same in both cases.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, none of the options seem to help resolve the discrepancy.
  The answer is "None of the above."
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks living in captivity and in the wild have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy despite the fact that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why both captive and wild leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D does not resolve the discrepancy. It only provides a reason why it is difficult to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  Choice E is the best answer because it suggests that the size of a leatherback is not a reliable indicator of its age. Therefore, the maximum life expectancy of captive and wild leatherbacks may not be as different as previously thought.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity as they do in the wild.
  Therefore, the answer choice that resolves the discrepancy should explain why leatherbacks can still reach their maximum life expectancy in captivity despite being susceptible to fatal diseases.
  Answer choice C provides a reason why leatherbacks can still reach their maximum life expectancy in the wild despite being susceptible to fatal diseases.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage states that leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy.
  However, leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why leatherbacks in captivity are not dying earlier than those in the wild.
  Choice A, B, D, and E do not provide any explanation for this.
  Choice C, on the other hand, suggests that the cause of death for most leatherbacks in the wild is not related to the diseases that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to.
  Therefore, C is the best answer.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero" is the most popular carbonated drink product and 72% of all consumers believe it already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the current market share of "Hero" will remain the same in the future.
  The argument does not commit the error of failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition.
  The argument does not mistake a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The argument does not treat the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true.
  The argument does not take evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  The argument commits the error of describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the opinion of consumers is an accurate representation of the market share of "Hero."
  However, the argument does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the survey results accurately reflect the current market share of "Hero."
  However, the survey results only reflect the opinions of the consumers, not the actual sales data.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The correct answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market and only needs to maintain its current market share to continue to do so.
  The argument uses the definition of a dominant product in a market as having more than 50% of the sales in that market.
  The argument also cites survey results that show 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument does not commit the error of failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition.
  The argument does not commit the error of treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true.
  The argument does not commit the error of taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  The argument does not commit the error of describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
  The argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result. The fact that "Hero" has more than 50% of the sales in the market is a necessary condition for it to be dominant, but it is not sufficient to guarantee that it will continue to be dominant. Other factors such as changes in consumer preferences or the introduction of new products could affect the market share of "Hero" and Harrold Foods' dominance in the market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and will continue to do so.
  The argument uses the survey results to support the conclusion.
  The survey results show that 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are accurate and reliable.
  The argument does not commit an error in reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72 percent of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are accurate and that the current market share of "Hero" will remain the same.
  The argument does not commit errors A, C, D, or E.
  The argument commits the error of mistaking a necessary condition for a sufficient condition.
  The fact that "Hero" has more than 50 percent of the sales in the market is a necessary condition for it to be dominant in the market, but it is not a sufficient condition.
  The argument assumes that Harrold Foods only needs to maintain its current market share to continue to dominate the market, but this is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
  The argument uses the definition of dominant product in a market as a product with more than 50% of the sales in that market.
  The argument also uses the survey results that show 72% of all consumers believe "Hero" already dominates the market.
  However, the argument does not consider the possibility that the survey results may not be accurate or that they may change in the future.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero" is the most popular carbonated drink product and 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.

  The argument does not commit the error described in options A, C, D, or E.
  Option B describes the error of mistaking a necessary condition for a sufficient condition, which is not committed in the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.

  The argument commits the error of describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
  Therefore, the answer is E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that since "Hero" has more than 50% of the sales in the market, it is, by definition, dominant in the market.
  However, the argument fails to consider the possibility that other companies may introduce new and more popular products in the future, which could change the market share of "Hero."
  The argument is assuming that the current market share of "Hero" will remain the same in the future, which is not necessarily true.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports this prediction.
  The fact that the game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers does not necessarily support the prediction.
  The fact that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game does not necessarily support the prediction.
  The fact that the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market does not necessarily support the prediction.
  The fact that most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward does not necessarily support the prediction.
  The fact that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend does not necessarily support the prediction.
  Therefore, none of the options support the prediction, but the most likely answer is C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports the prediction.
  Option B states that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  This suggests that players will need to rent the game multiple times before completing it.
  This will increase the rental revenue for the publisher.
  It also suggests that players who rent the game multiple times may eventually purchase it.
  Therefore, option B most helps to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports the prediction.
  The game is available for purchase or rental.
  Renters who go on to purchase the game are offered a rebate equal to the cost of one rental.
  Therefore, people who rent the game are more likely to purchase it.
  Option B is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option C is already given in the context.
  Option D weakens the prediction.
  Option E does not support the prediction.
  Option A suggests that the game is available from multiple sources.
  Therefore, more people can purchase or rent the game.
  This increases the chances of the game being purchased.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find the option that justifies this prediction.
  The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it.
  The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals.
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  Rentals are exceeding expectations.
  Option B states that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  This means that most players will have to rent the game multiple times or purchase the game to complete it.
  Therefore, option B most helps to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  To justify the prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that sales will increase.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B suggests that players take a long time to complete the game, but it does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.
  Option C suggests that the publisher's games are popular, but it does not necessarily mean that sales of this particular game will increase.
  Option D suggests that most people do not play the game extensively after completing it, which does not support the idea that sales will increase.
  Option E suggests that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend. This means that more people will play the game, which could lead to increased sales.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that rentals will lead to sales.
  Option A is irrelevant as it talks about the availability of the game.
  Option B is also irrelevant as it talks about the time taken to complete the game.
  Option C is also irrelevant as it talks about the popularity of the publisher's games.
  Option D is also irrelevant as it talks about the post-completion behavior of the players.
  Option E is also irrelevant as it talks about the behavior of some people who buy and complete the game.
  None of the options seem to justify the publisher's prediction.
  However, option A could be considered as a weak justification as it suggests that the game is easily available for purchase.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the game will sell well.
  Option A is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option B suggests that players will take a long time to complete the game, which may or may not affect the sales of the game.
  Option C suggests that the publisher's games are popular, but it does not necessarily mean that this particular game will sell well.
  Option D suggests that most people do not play the game extensively afterward, which may or may not affect the sales of the game.
  Option E suggests that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, which may or may not affect the sales of the game.
  Therefore, the best option that supports the idea that the game will sell well is C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that sales will increase.
  Option A is not relevant to the prediction.
  Option B suggests that players take a long time to complete the game, which may not necessarily mean that sales will increase.
  Option C suggests that the publisher's games are popular, but it doesn't necessarily mean that sales of this particular game will increase.
  Option D suggests that most people do not play the game extensively afterward, which may not necessarily mean that sales will increase.
  Option E suggests that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend. This option implies that the game is popular enough that people are buying it and giving it away as gifts. This suggests that sales will increase.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports the publisher's prediction.
  Option B states that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  This means that players will need to rent the game multiple times before they can complete it.
  This will lead to an increase in rentals, and eventually, sales of the game.
  Therefore, option B most helps to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find the option that justifies the prediction.
  The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers, but this does not justify the prediction.
  It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, but this does not justify the prediction.
  The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market, but this does not justify the prediction.
  Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, but this does not justify the prediction.
  Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend. This means that the game could have more players than the sales figures suggest. Therefore, this option justifies the prediction.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. But the inflation rate actually increased. Therefore, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  Choice A talks about the architecture of the valley and how it remained the same throughout their stay. The conclusion drawn is that the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay. This is a non-sequitur as there could be other reasons why the architecture remained the same.
  Choice B talks about workers in key industries who have promised not to strike. The conclusion drawn is that these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This is a non-sequitur as there could be other reasons why the workers have promised not to strike.
  Choice C talks about the company's stock price that did not increase in the last two years. The conclusion drawn is that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This is a non-sequitur as there could be other reasons why the stock price did not increase.
  Choice D talks about city residents who have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days. The conclusion drawn is that the rebels must have won the battle. This is a non-sequitur as there could be other reasons why the residents are showing support for the rebels.
  Choice E talks about the television station's new weather forecasting equipment. The conclusion drawn is that the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This is similar to the argument above where the conclusion is drawn based on the lack of evidence to support the premise.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened.
  However, the inflation rate actually increased.
  Therefore, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The flawed reasoning in the argument is that it assumes a causal relationship between the party's economic theories and the inflation rate, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the increase in inflation.
  Choice C has a similar flawed reasoning as it assumes a causal relationship between the company's success in selling its subsidiaries and the doubling of its stock price, without considering other factors that may have affected the stock price.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound, the inflation rate would have lessened. 
  However, the inflation rate increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The argument assumes that the party's economic theories were sound to begin with.
  The flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above is the one that assumes a condition that is not necessarily true.
  Choice C assumes that the company succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and that the stock price would have doubled if it had. 
  The stock price did not increase, so the argument concludes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  The argument assumes that the condition of the company succeeding in selling its subsidiaries is true.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, then the inflation rate would have decreased. However, the inflation rate increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  This argument is flawed because it assumes a cause-and-effect relationship between the party's economic theories and the inflation rate without considering other factors that could have contributed to the increase in inflation.
  Choice C has a similar flawed reasoning because it assumes a cause-and-effect relationship between the company's success in selling its subsidiaries and the increase in stock price without considering other factors that could have influenced the stock price.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound, the inflation rate would have decreased. But the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories were the only factor that could have affected the inflation rate.
  Choice C has a similar flawed reasoning, as it assumes that the company's failure to sell its subsidiaries was the only factor that could have affected the stock price.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that if the party's economic theories had been sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories were sound and that their implementation would have led to a decrease in the inflation rate. It does not consider other factors that may have contributed to the increase in the inflation rate.
  Choice C has a similar flawed reasoning. It assumes that the company's failure to sell its subsidiaries is the only reason why the stock price did not increase in the last two years. It does not consider other factors that may have affected the stock price.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, then the inflation rate would have decreased.
  However, the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The argument assumes that the only reason the inflation rate increased was due to the party's economic theories being flawed.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument above is assuming that one cause is responsible for an effect, without considering other possible causes.
  The argument in choice C has a similar flawed reasoning, as it assumes that the only reason the stock price did not increase was because the company failed to sell its subsidiaries.

Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. 
  But since the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  This is a flawed reasoning of assuming that the opposite of an expected outcome must be true.
  The argument that most closely resembles this flawed reasoning is option C.
  Option C assumes that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years.
  But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. 
  Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  This is a flawed reasoning of assuming that the opposite of an expected outcome must be true.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have decreased. However, the inflation rate increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  Option C states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. However, the stock price did not increase in that time, so the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  Both arguments follow the same flawed reasoning pattern of assuming that a certain outcome would have occurred if a certain action was taken, and concluding that the opposite outcome means that the action was not taken.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Government official: Residents who are foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries. This is wise, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. So, ____.
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the government official's statement?
Choices:
  A: foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve
  B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries
  C: only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries
  D: foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries
  E: cabinet undersecretaries should not be expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because some duties should only be performed by citizens.
  Additionally, cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the official would not want foreign citizens to be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries either, since they may need to perform duties that should only be performed by citizens.
  The answer is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because some duties should only be performed by citizens.
  The official also argues that cabinet undersecretaries should be able to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, the statement should logically complete by addressing the appointment of cabinet secretaries and the duties they perform.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not supported by the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D contradicts the argument made by the official.
  Choice E contradicts the argument made by the official.
  Therefore, none of the choices logically complete the statement.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because some duties should only be performed by citizens. 
  The official also argues that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, it would be inconsistent to allow foreign citizens to serve as cabinet undersecretaries if they cannot serve as cabinet secretaries.
  The statement that would most logically complete the official's argument is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.

  The biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  The biologist argues that if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
  The answer that most strengthens the biologist's argument should support the idea that humans are content with different configurations of fingers.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B goes against the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument but is too strong.
  Choice D supports the argument but is not the best answer.
  Choice E supports the argument by providing evidence that a fish with six phalanges in its fins existed.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that our configuration of fingers is not inherently more or less useful than other configurations.
  The biologist's argument is that if humans had six fingers, they would be just as content with that configuration.
  Therefore, the answer choice that most strengthens the biologist's argument would support the idea that the number of fingers we have is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations.
  Answer choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Answer choice A is not relevant to the argument and is not supported by the biologist's statement.
  Answer choice B is not relevant to the argument and is not supported by the biologist's statement.
  Answer choice C supports the idea that humans would be equally content with six fingers, but it does not support the idea that the number of fingers we have is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations.
  Answer choice D supports the idea that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices, which strengthens the biologist's argument that our configuration of fingers is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.

  Choice A does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument.
  Choice B is too extreme and does not relate to the argument.
  Choice C is too extreme and does not relate to the argument.
  Choice D supports the argument, but it is not the most relevant to the biologist's argument.
  Choice E provides evidence that supports the biologist's argument.
  If at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins, then it is possible that humans could have descended from that species and have been content with six fingers on each hand.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that humans would be just as content with six fingers if we had evolved from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to show that humans are content with different configurations of fingers.
  Choice A does not help to strengthen the argument because it is not necessarily true that everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  Choice B weakens the argument because it suggests that humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice C is too strong and absolute to be true in all cases.
  Choice D supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on objective facts but rather on our prejudices.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.

  The question is asking which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument.
  Option A is irrelevant to the biologist's argument.
  Option B is not supported by the biologist's argument.
  Option C supports the biologist's argument, but it is not the most relevant option.
  Option D supports the biologist's argument, but it is not the most relevant option.
  Option E strengthens the biologist's argument by providing evidence that the scenario described by the biologist is plausible.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that humans would be just as content with six fingers if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that humans are content with things of equal usefulness.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B weakens the argument by suggesting that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness.
  Choice C strengthens the argument by suggesting that humans are always equally content with things of equal usefulness.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that humans would be just as content with six fingers if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the number of fingers is not important to humans.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is not supported by the argument.
  Option C is too extreme and not supported by the argument.
  Option D supports the argument, but not as strongly as option E.
  Option E provides evidence that supports the argument that six fingers could have been just as useful as five fingers.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that humans' configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  The argument is based on the assumption that humans' contentment with their configuration of fingers is not due to any inherent usefulness of that configuration.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to provide evidence that supports this assumption.
  Choice D provides this evidence by stating that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  The biologist argues that if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
  The answer choice that would strengthen the biologist's argument would support the idea that humans would be content with a different configuration of fingers.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument.
  Option B is not relevant to the argument.
  Option C is not relevant to the argument.
  Option D supports the idea that our perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  Option E is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not necessarily superior to other possible configurations.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to show that usefulness is not the only factor that determines contentment.
  Choice A is irrelevant because the argument is not about whether people are content with our present configuration of fingers.
  Choice B weakens the argument because it suggests that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it is too general and does not relate to the argument.
  Choice D supports the argument by suggesting that our perception of usefulness is not based on objective reality but on our prejudices.
  Choice E is irrelevant because the argument is not about the existence of fish with six phalanges in their fins.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that were made.
  We need to find the option that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Option A suggests that the actuaries were more closely monitored than the accountants, which strengthens the detective's argument.
  Option B suggests that someone outside the corporation could have had access to the financial records, which weakens the detective's argument.
  Option C suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, which weakens the detective's argument.
  Option D suggests that the corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place, which weakens the detective's argument.
  Option E suggests that the security measures made it harder for the actuaries to access the financial records, which weakens the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

  The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Choice A describes a situation where Riley did not think about the possibility of a traffic accident resulting from parking his car in the center lane of Main Street. Therefore, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  Choice B describes a situation where Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. Therefore, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms implies the presence of immunity.
  This flawed pattern of reasoning is similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in one of the choices.
  Choice A is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice B is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that writers of fiction are not advertisers, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice C is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice D is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice E is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that doctors washing their hands less often than any other health care professionals implies that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is most similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in choice E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The student argues that if a person is exposed to a microorganism without developing harmful symptoms, then they have immunity to that microorganism.
  This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is equivalent to immunity.
  Therefore, we need to find an answer choice that has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Answer choice C is similar in that it assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and therefore, Isabel must not have taken the medication because she is still ill.
  This is flawed because it assumes that medication is always effective and that there are no other reasons why Isabel might still be ill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The student's argument is that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is equivalent to immunity.
  Therefore, we need to find an answer choice that has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Answer choice C is similar in that it assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and that the absence of a cure or symptom alleviation means that the medication was not taken.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The student concludes that people have immunity to staphylococcus because many people are exposed to it without developing harmful symptoms.
  The argument is flawed because not all people who are exposed to staphylococcus develop immunity to it.
  The pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is similar to the pattern of reasoning in answer choice C.
  In answer choice C, the speaker concludes that Isabel did not take the medication because she is still quite ill.
  The argument is flawed because medication does not always cure disease or alleviate its symptoms.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms indicates immunity to infection.
  The argument is similar in pattern to answer choice C, which assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This argument is flawed because the fact that someone is not affected by a microorganism does not necessarily mean that they have an immunity to it.
  The argument is similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in option C, where Isabel's failure to take medication does not necessarily mean that medication cannot cure disease or alleviate its symptoms.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they have an immunity to that microorganism.
  This is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is always due to immunity.
  The argument is similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in choice C, which assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The student assumes that people who are not affected by staphylococcus have an immunity to it.
  The argument is flawed because not everyone who is not affected by staphylococcus has an immunity to it.
  Therefore, the pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is similar to the pattern of reasoning in which choice?
  Choice A is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice B is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice C is flawed because it assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice D is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice E is flawed because it assumes that doctors washing their hands less often means that the procedure is not valuable in preventing disease, which is not necessarily true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after exposure to a microorganism, then they have an immunity to infection by that microorganism.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is equivalent to immunity.
  The pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is most similar to the pattern of reasoning in which one of the choices?
  Choice A is about the relationship between morality and justice, and how some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice B is about the persuasive intent of advertisers and writers of fiction. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice C is about the assumption that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and how this assumption leads to the conclusion that Isabel did not take the medication. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice D is about the relationship between excessive taxation and business expansion, and how the recent decline in business expansions shows that taxes are too high. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice E is about the assumption that the frequency of hand washing by doctors is indicative of the value of the procedure in preventing disease. It is similar to the student's argument in that it assumes a relationship between two variables without sufficient evidence.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage states that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The passage also states that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans.
  However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  Therefore, there is a conflict between the requirement for a high-calorie diet and the fact that the human brain's evolution took place in areas that did not have the most abundant and reliable food resources.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find a statement that explains why the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas instead of shore environments.
  Choice E provides a possible explanation for this by stating that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

  The argument does not generalize from the behavior of a few bears, but rather makes a claim about the species as a whole based on physical characteristics.
  The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity, as it specifically states that the behavior is instinctive and not learned.
  The argument does not change the meaning of the word "behavior" during the course of the argument.
  The argument does not presume that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  The argument does not appeal to the authority of science in an incorrect way.
  Therefore, the argument is not vulnerable to any of the given criticisms.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The argument is based on the fact that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the movement required to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Therefore, an assumption required by the argument would be a statement that supports the idea that Diplodocus could not browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is a possible alternative, but it is not required by the argument.
  Choice E contradicts the argument by suggesting that Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation.
  Therefore, none of the choices is an assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Instead, it could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  The assumption required by the argument should be a statement that connects the evidence to the conclusion.
  The argument does not mention anything about modern ground-feeding animals, blood supply to the brain, or other ways Diplodocus could access high-growing vegetation.
  The assumption should be related to the argument's conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus did not have any other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
  The answer is D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation but could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument must be related to Diplodocus's ability to access high-growing vegetation.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not related to the argument.
  Choice D suggests another way for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation, which contradicts the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  None of the choices is the assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument also states that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument must be related to the conclusion.
  The assumption must state that there were no other ways for Diplodocus to feed on high-growing vegetation.
  Choice D states that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  This assumption supports the conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but could bend its neck downward to access underwater vegetation.
  The argument assumes that Diplodocus needed to access underwater vegetation because it could not find enough food on or near the ground.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus could not find enough food on or near the ground.
  The answer is D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:

  Choice D suggests that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
  However, the argument does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
  Therefore, choice D is not the correct answer.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B and C are not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice E suggests an alternative way for Diplodocus to browse for underwater vegetation.
  However, the argument does not mention this possibility.
  Therefore, choice E is not the correct answer.
  The correct answer is an assumption required by the argument.
  It is that there were no other ways for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument also states that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  The assumption required by the argument should be related to these two statements.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Option C is not related to the argument.
  Option D is the opposite of what the argument suggests.
  Option E is related to the argument, but it is not necessary to assume that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
  Therefore, none of the options is the assumption required by the argument.
  The answer is "None of the Above".

Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Instead, it must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The argument must assume something that supports this claim.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not related to the argument.
  Choice D is opposite to the argument.
  Choice E is a possibility that contradicts the argument.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Consumer magazine: Because front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers. So, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument in the consumer magazine?
Choices:
  A: All top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water.
  B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.
  C: A washing machine gets clothes really clean only with a laundry detergent specially formulated for that machine.
  D: A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
  E: Washers that use more water get clothes cleaner than those that use less.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The principle stated above says that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The principle is used to determine whether a contract is valid or not.
  Option A talks about a legitimate offer that has not been rejected. It is a valid contract.
  Option B talks about an offer made in jest. It is not a valid contract.
  Option C talks about a legitimate offer that Mindy should accept if she is reasonable. It does not talk about the validity of the contract.
  Option D talks about an offer that was not made in jest and is therefore valid if accepted.
  Option E talks about an offer that is not legitimate. It does not talk about the validity of the contract.
  Therefore, the principle stated above most helps to justify the reasoning in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The principle is used to justify the reasoning in one of the arguments.
  Option A is incorrect because it only mentions a legitimate offer and a lack of rejection, but it does not mention whether the offer was made in jest.
  Option B is correct because it mentions an offer made in jest, which would not be legitimate according to the principle.
  Option C is incorrect because it assumes that Mindy is a reasonable person and will accept the offer, but it does not mention whether the offer was legitimate or made in jest.
  Option D is correct because it mentions that the offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, which would make the offer legitimate according to the principle.
  Option E is incorrect because it only mentions that the offer was not legitimate, but it does not mention whether the offer was made in jest.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or D. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest. 
Option A talks about a legitimate offer being made and not rejected, but it doesn't mention if the offer was made in jest or not.
Option B talks about an offer being made in jest, which is not legitimate, and thus the contract is not valid. This aligns with the principle stated above.
Option C talks about a legitimate offer being made, but it doesn't mention if the offer was made in jest or not.
Option D talks about an offer being made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, and if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. This aligns with the principle stated above.
Option E talks about there being no valid contract between Sal and Veronica, but it doesn't mention if the offer was legitimate or not.
Therefore, the answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The principle is used to justify the reasoning in one of the arguments.
  Option A states that Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract. This argument does not use the principle stated above.
  Option B states that Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. This argument uses the principle stated above to justify the reasoning.
  Option C states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. This argument does not use the principle stated above.
  Option D states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. This argument uses the principle stated above to justify the reasoning.
  Option E states that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. This argument does not use the principle stated above.
  Therefore, the principle stated above most helps to justify the reasoning in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The argument that best justifies this principle is the one that involves an offer that was not legitimate because it was made in jest.
  Option B describes a scenario where an offer was made in jest, and the contract was not valid.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Choice A is correct because Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  Choice B is incorrect because Gus made the offer in jest, which means the offer was not legitimate.
  Choice C is incorrect because the principle does not state that Mindy must accept the offer, even if it is legitimate.
  Choice D is correct because Hai's offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  Choice E is incorrect because the principle does not state that an offer is not legitimate if it is the only offer made.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A talks about a legitimate offer and an acceptance, but it does not mention anything about the offer being made in jest.
  Option B talks about an offer being made in jest, which makes the contract not valid. This aligns with the principle stated above.
  Option C talks about a legitimate offer, but it does not mention anything about the offer being made in jest.
  Option D talks about an offer being made in such a way that no one in the position of the party to whom it was made would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. This aligns with the principle stated above.
  Option E talks about an offer that was not legitimate, but it does not mention anything about the offer being made in jest.
  Therefore, the principle stated above most helps to justify the reasoning in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The principle states that a legitimate offer is required for a valid contract.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The argument that best justifies the principle is the one that applies the principle correctly.
  Option A applies the principle correctly.
  Option B applies the principle incorrectly.
  Option C does not mention the legitimacy of the offer.
  Option D applies the principle correctly.
  Option E does not mention the legitimacy of the offer.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option B mentions that the offer was made in jest, which makes it not legitimate.
  Option C assumes that Frank's offer is legitimate but does not mention whether Mindy accepted it or not.
  Option D mentions that the offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, which makes it a legitimate offer.
  Option E mentions that the only offer made by Sal was not legitimate, but it does not mention whether it was made in jest or not.
  Therefore, the principle stated above most helps to justify the reasoning in option B.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A talks about the rate of jogging injuries, but it does not affect the argument.
  Option B talks about the difficulty in performing stretches, but it does not affect the argument.
  Option C talks about the cause of jogging injuries, but it does not affect the argument.
  Option D talks about the habit of performing stretches, but it does not affect the argument.
  Option E talks about the effect of stretching on certain forms of exercise, which is different from jogging.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.

  This conclusion is not necessarily true because there could be other factors that affect enrollment in the class.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is similar to that in option B, which concludes that most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks based on the results of an opinion poll.
  This conclusion is not necessarily true because there could be other factors that affect residents' opinions on spending.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class while most of the psychology majors are not.
  The argument assumes that the number of sociology majors and psychology majors in the class is proportional to the number of sociology majors and psychology majors in general, which may not be true.
  Choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning as it assumes that the opinion poll is representative of the entire population.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is flawed because it ignores the possibility that the number of psychology majors not taking the class could be greater than the number of sociology majors taking the class.
  Choice B is similar in that it assumes that the majority opinion in an opinion poll represents the opinion of the majority of the population without considering the possibility of a biased sample or a close split in opinions.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that the proportion of majors in the class is the same as the proportion of majors in the university.
  The argument is similar to option B because it assumes that the majority opinion in the opinion poll represents the majority opinion of all residents.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  The argument assumes that the number of sociology majors and psychology majors in the class is proportional to the number of sociology and psychology majors at Morris University.
  This is flawed reasoning because it ignores other factors that could influence the enrollment in the class.
  Choice B is similar in that it assumes that the opinion poll is representative of the entire population of Silver Falls, which may not be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class while most of the psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is flawed because it assumes that the proportion of sociology majors who take the class is the same as the proportion of psychology majors who take the class.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning is most similar to that in option B.
  Option B concludes that most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks based on the premise that more residents said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than on parks.
  This conclusion is flawed because it assumes that the residents who did not express a preference for either option are opposed to both options.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  The argument assumes that the proportion of sociology majors enrolled in the class is greater than the proportion of psychology majors enrolled in the class.
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be more psychology majors enrolled in the class than sociology majors, even if most sociology majors are taking the class.
  Choice B is similar in that it assumes that the proportion of Silver Falls residents in favor of increased spending on roads is greater than the proportion of residents in favor of increased spending on parks, based on the results of an opinion poll.
  This is flawed reasoning because the poll may not be representative of the entire population of Silver Falls residents.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is flawed because it assumes that the number of students in each major is equal.
  The argument is similar to option B, which concludes that most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks based on the premise that more residents said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than on parks.
  This conclusion is flawed because it assumes that the number of residents who were polled is equal for both options.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class but most of the psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is not necessarily true because the argument does not provide any information about the total number of sociology majors and psychology majors enrolled in the class.
  Choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning where the conclusion is based on the premise that more Silver Falls residents are in favor of spending more on roads than parks without providing any information about the total number of residents polled.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class while most of the psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is flawed because it assumes that the number of students in each major is equal, which is not necessarily the case.
  Choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning where it assumes that the majority of the residents are in favor of spending more on roads and opposed to spending more on parks based on the results of an opinion poll.
  This conclusion is flawed because it assumes that the poll is representative of the entire population and that the respondents' opinions are fixed and not subject to change.

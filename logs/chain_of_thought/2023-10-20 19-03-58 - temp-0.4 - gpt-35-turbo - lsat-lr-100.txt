### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola over the other colas tested.
  The study was carefully controlled and the volunteers were blindfolded.
  However, the advertisement may be vulnerable to criticism.
  Choice A is not relevant because each group tasted a different cola.
  Choice B is not relevant because the advertisement does not mention the price of Sparkle Cola.
  Choice C is a possible criticism because the advertisement only tested five colas and there may be others that are preferred over Sparkle Cola.
  Choice D is a possible criticism because there may be other factors that influence why people prefer Sparkle Cola over other colas.
  Choice E is not relevant because the study was only concerned with colas.
  The best answer is either C or D, but D is a more direct criticism of the study.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement that if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, squirrels will eat from it.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, as there may be other reasons why a bird feeder does not attract many birds.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning is similar to that in answer choice D, which concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  Neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly is not the only reason why a tire may wear out prematurely.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement in the form of a biconditional.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The argument assumes that the only reason squirrels eat from a bird feeder is that it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument does not consider other factors that may affect the number of birds attracted to a bird feeder.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is most similar to that in option A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument above is based on a conditional statement and a causal relationship.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  However, the argument does not consider the possibility that squirrels may still eat from a bird feeder with a protective cover.
  Choice A is not similar because it does not involve a causal relationship.
  Choice B is not similar because it does not involve a conditional statement.
  Choice C is not similar because it does not involve a flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Choice D is similar because it involves a causal relationship and a conditional statement, but it does not involve the possibility of other causes.
  Choice E is not similar because it involves a different cause.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover, but it doesn't provide any evidence to support this claim.
  The argument assumes that the only reason squirrels eat from a bird feeder is that it lacks a protective cover, which may not be true.
  The argument uses a conditional statement to conclude that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  Choice B uses a similar conditional statement to conclude that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument above is based on the conditional statement and the negation of the consequent.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is because of squirrels eating from it.
  Choice A is not similar to the argument above.
  Choice B is similar to the argument above, as it concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, without considering other possible reasons.
  Choice C is not similar to the argument above.
  Choice D is similar to the argument above, as it concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, without considering other possible reasons.
  Choice E is not similar to the argument above.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or D.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The evidence is that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The conclusion is that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The flaw in the argument is that it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is because of squirrels. It ignores other possible reasons.
  Choice E has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning, which assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because of low pressure. It ignores other possible reasons.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The evidence is that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.

  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder would not attract many birds is because of squirrels, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice A is not similar.
  Choice B is similar because it assumes that the only reason a tire would wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice C is not similar.
  Choice D is similar because it assumes that the only reason a tire would wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice E is not similar.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The argument supports this conclusion by stating that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument assumes that the presence of squirrels is the only factor that affects the number of birds attracted to a bird feeder.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is most similar to that in answer choice B.
  Answer choice B concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  Answer choice B supports this conclusion by stating that tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  Answer choice B assumes that neglecting to check tire pressure is the only factor that affects tire wear.

  The argument ignores other possible reasons why a bird feeder may not attract many birds.
  The argument's pattern of reasoning is similar to that in answer choice B.
  Answer choice B also assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is that the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  Answer choice B ignores other possible reasons why a tire may wear out prematurely.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover based on the premise that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent, which is a formal fallacy that occurs when a conditional statement is assumed to be false because its consequent is false.
  The argument can be represented as:
    P1: If a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, squirrels eat from it.
    P2: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds.
    C: If a bird feeder does not have a protective cover, it will not attract many birds.
  Answer choices A, B, and D are not similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above.
  Answer choice C commits the fallacy of assuming that car owners are aware of the fact that tires wear out prematurely if they neglect to check the tire pressure regularly.
  Answer choice E introduces a new premise that is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think they will be victims of natural disasters.
  We need to find an answer choice that weakens the argument by showing that the relationship between watching television and overestimating the risks of natural disasters is not as strong as the argument suggests.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the relationship between television and overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it does not address the relationship between television and overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  Choice C strengthens the argument by suggesting that people who watch less television have a more accurate idea of the risks of natural disasters.
  Choice D weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well informed about the risks of natural disasters tend to learn about them in ways other than watching television.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it does not address the relationship between television and overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find an answer that weakens this claim.
  If there is an alternative explanation for why people overestimate the risks of natural disasters, then the argument is weakened.
  Choice A does not provide an alternative explanation for why people overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C does not provide an alternative explanation for why people overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  Choice D provides an alternative explanation for why people may not overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  Choice E does not provide an alternative explanation for why people overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risk of natural disasters.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that this is not necessarily true.
  Option A does not address the impact of television on people's perception of risk.
  Option B suggests that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, which does not address the argument.
  Option C suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television have a more accurate perception of risk, which supports the argument.
  Option D suggests that people who are well informed about natural disasters do not learn from television, which weakens the argument.
  Option E suggests that people who live in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch more television, which supports the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This suggests that watching television may not be the cause of people overestimating the risk of natural disasters.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  It further states that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
  We need to find an option that weakens the argument.
  Option A does not weaken the argument as it states that many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  Option B does not weaken the argument as it states that a person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  Option C strengthens the argument as it states that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  Option D weakens the argument as it states that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  Option E does not weaken the argument as it states that a person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find an option that weakens the argument.
  Option A is irrelevant as it doesn't talk about the amount of television people watch.
  Option B is also irrelevant as it talks about the likelihood of living in an area prone to natural disasters.
  Option C strengthens the argument by stating that people who watch less television tend to have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
  Option D weakens the argument by stating that people who are well-informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  Option E is irrelevant as it talks about the likelihood of watching television based on where a person lives.
  
Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that television is not the only factor that causes people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the role of television in overestimating the risks.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it does not address the relationship between television and overestimating the risks.
  Choice C strengthens the argument by suggesting that people who watch less television have a more accurate perception of the risks.
  Choice D weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well-informed about natural disasters tend to get their information from sources other than television.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it does not address the role of television in overestimating the risks.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  To weaken this argument, we need to show that there is no causal relationship between watching too much television and overestimating the risks of natural disasters or that there is no relationship at all.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is out of scope because it talks about the likelihood of living in an area prone to natural disasters.
  Choice C strengthens the argument, so it is incorrect.
  Choice D weakens the argument because it suggests that there are other ways to become well-informed about the risks posed by natural disasters.
  Choice E is out of scope because it talks about the likelihood of watching an above-average amount of television based on where a person lives.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The argument provides evidence that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than if they do not.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that suggests that watching television is not the only reason why people overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  Option A is a possible contender, but it does not address the issue of whether watching television is the cause of overestimating risks.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about the likelihood of living in an area prone to natural disasters, not the effect of television on risk perception.
  Option C is a possible contender because it suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television have an accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of natural disasters. However, it does not address whether television viewing affects risk perception.
  Option D is a strong contender because it suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This weakens the argument that television viewing is the cause of overestimating risks.
  Option E is irrelevant because it talks about the likelihood of watching television in areas prone to natural disasters, not the effect of television on risk perception.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that suggests that television viewing is not the cause of overestimation of the risks of natural disasters.
  Option A does not address the link between television viewing and overestimation of risks.
  Option B suggests that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, which is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C suggests that people who watch less television have a more accurate idea of the risks of natural disasters, which strengthens the argument rather than weakening it.
  Option D suggests that people who are well informed about the risks of natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, which weakens the argument.
  Option E suggests that people who live in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch more television, which does not address the link between television viewing and overestimation of risks.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This suggests that television viewing is not the only factor that leads to overestimation of risks.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates indicates that publishing scholarly journals has become much more profitable.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that the increase in subscription rates does not necessarily mean that publishing scholarly journals is more profitable.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it does not address the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
  Choice C supports the argument.
  Choice D weakens the argument by suggesting that libraries are not the main subscribers and that subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant, but the subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically. Therefore, publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer that shows that the conclusion is not necessarily true.
  A, B, C, and E are irrelevant to the argument.
  D suggests that the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. This means that the publishers are not making more profit from individual subscribers. Therefore, the argument that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago is weakened.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant while the subscription rate has increased dramatically.
  The argument concludes that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the conclusion.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument.
  Choice D contradicts the conclusion of the argument. If the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years, then publishing a scholarly journal may not be more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals is due to the increased profitability of publishing them.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that provides an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.

  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C supports the argument and does not weaken it.
  Option D provides an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates. If the subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged, then the profitability of publishing scholarly journals cannot be the only reason for the increase in subscription rates.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. 
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  The argument concludes that the knowledge of careful monitoring of errors made the staff more meticulous.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to provide evidence that the decrease in injuries is indeed due to the implementation of the plan.
  Choice B is irrelevant as it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Choice C is irrelevant as it talks about errors that were not recorded.
  Choice E is also irrelevant as it talks about the consequences of errors.
  Choice A could weaken the argument as it suggests that the hospitals already had a policy of investigating life-threatening errors.
  Choice D strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in injuries began only after the staff became aware of the records being closely analyzed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find a statement that supports the causal relationship between the implementation of the plan and the decrease in patient injuries.
  Choice B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was incomplete.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
  Choice A may be a valid policy, but it does not strengthen the argument.
  Choice D suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was a result of the staff becoming aware of the records being closely analyzed, which supports the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at the hospitals since the implementation of the plan to systematically record staff errors.
  The argument concludes that the knowledge of careful monitoring made the hospital staff more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.

  Choice B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was a direct result of the staff's awareness of the records being closely analyzed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has decreased substantially after implementing the plan to record all staff errors.
  The argument suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff's increased meticulousness in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries is due to staff's increased meticulousness.
  Answer choice B is irrelevant because it talks about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Answer choice C is irrelevant because it talks about staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  Answer choice E is irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors that caused injuries to patients.
  Answer choice A is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a policy that was already in place before implementing the plan.
  Answer choice D suggests that the decrease in patient injuries began only after the staff became aware that their records were being analyzed closely. This supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries is due to staff's increased meticulousness. Therefore, Answer("D") is the correct answer. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that the systematic recording of staff errors led to a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries is indeed due to the systematic recording of staff errors.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that not all staff errors were recorded.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
  Option A and D are both relevant, but option D is stronger because it directly links the decrease in patient injuries to the knowledge that the records were being closely analyzed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors resulted in a substantial decrease in patient injuries. 
The argument suggests that the knowledge of being monitored made the staff more meticulous in carrying out their duties.
To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the plan was the reason for the decrease in patient injuries.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is not relevant to the argument since it is about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
Option C weakens the argument by stating that some staff errors were not recorded.
Option D strengthens the argument by stating that the decrease in injuries began only after the staff became aware of the monitoring.
Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that the systematic recording of staff errors led to a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports this causal relationship.
  Answer choice B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Answer choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  Answer choice E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effect of the plan.
  Answer choice A is also irrelevant because it talks about a policy that was already in place before the plan was implemented.
  Answer choice D supports the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was a result of the staff becoming aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The argument states that the knowledge of monitoring made the staff more careful, so the choice that strengthens the argument the most would be one that shows that the monitoring was the cause of the decrease in the number of injuries. 
Option B does not support the argument because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan, so it is irrelevant. 
Option C weakens the argument because it shows that not all errors were recorded. 
Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the punishment for staff members who made errors. 
Option A could be a possible answer, but it does not strengthen the argument as much as option D, which shows that the decrease in the number of injuries started after the staff became aware of the monitoring. 
Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that the systematic recording of staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the systematic recording of staff errors.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C is irrelevant because it talks about staff errors that did not cause patient injuries.
  Option E is irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a policy that existed before the implementation of the plan.
  Option D directly supports the argument by stating that the decrease in patient injuries did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
  If the plan was not the only factor that contributed to the decrease in patient injuries, then the argument's conclusion that the plan was the reason for the decrease is weakened.
  Choice B suggests that the incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  If this is true, then the plan may not have been the only factor contributing to the decrease in patient injuries.
  Therefore, choice B most strengthens the argument.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

Response 3:
Thought:
  The city built a new highway to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  We need to explain why the new highway did not relieve traffic congestion.
  Option A suggests that most people who work in downtown Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs. If this is true, then the new highway linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area may not have much impact on the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner. Therefore, this option does not explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option B suggests that the location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs. If this is true, then the new highway may have attracted more commuters from the largest suburbs, leading to an increase in traffic congestion. Therefore, this option may explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option C suggests that several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights. If this is true, then the new stoplights may have slowed down the traffic flow, leading to an increase in average commute time. Therefore, this option may explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option D suggests that road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner at the same time the new highway was being built. If this is true, then the road repair work may have caused traffic congestion, leading to an increase in average commute time. Therefore, this option may explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option E suggests that traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened. If this is true, then the new highway may have attracted more commuters, leading to an increase in traffic congestion. Therefore, this option may explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option B, C, D, and E may explain the increase in average commute time. However, option B seems to be the most plausible explanation.

  We need to find a statement that explains why the new highway did not relieve traffic congestion.
  Option A suggests that most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs. This could mean that the new highway increased the number of people commuting to downtown Gastner, which would explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option B suggests that the location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs. This could mean that people from other suburbs are now using the new highway to commute to downtown Gastner, which would explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option C suggests that several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights. This could mean that the new stoplights are causing traffic congestion, which would explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option D suggests that road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner at the same time the new highway was being built. This could mean that the road repair work caused additional traffic congestion, which would explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option E suggests that traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened. This could mean that the new highway caused traffic to shift to other roads, which would explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option A and B both suggest that the new highway increased the number of people commuting to downtown Gastner, which would explain the increase in average commute time.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is about the justification for imposing a severe penalty.
  The reason for not imposing the penalty is the lack of sufficient evidence to identify the polluter.
  The principle that would most help to justify the reasoning in the argument is the one that supports the conclusion that the penalty should not be imposed unless there is sufficient evidence to identify the polluter.
  Choice A is close but it does not address the issue of sufficient evidence.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E supports the conclusion that the penalty should not be imposed unless there is sufficient evidence to justify it.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument is about the justification of imposing a penalty for a pollution infraction.
  The argument concludes that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, the penalty cannot be imposed.
  The conclusion is based on the premise that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  Choice A is the best answer because it directly supports the premise that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that it cannot be imposed unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility. 
This implies that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Therefore, the principle that most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that the penalty for pollution is so severe that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  The principle that would justify this reasoning is that the severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Action: Answer("E")

  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument is discussing the severity of the penalty for pollution.
  The argument suggests that the penalty is so severe that stronger evidence or an admission of guilt is necessary.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.

Response 0:
Thought: 
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal to spend the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam is unacceptable.
  To justify this judgment, we need to find a principle that supports the idea that the money should be used for building a dam.
  Choice B is the most relevant because it suggests that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  Building a dam is likely to benefit the entire community by providing a reliable source of water, while building new roads may only benefit some members of the community.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

  The argument in the advertisement is that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is based on a survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders who reported savings of $250 a year, on average.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if there are some factors that have not been considered or addressed.
  Choice A criticizes the argument for overlooking the possibility that some new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  This criticism would weaken the argument because if some policyholders did not save money, then the average savings of $250 a year would not be applicable to all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  Therefore, the answer is A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The advertisement supports this claim by citing a recent survey of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders who reported savings of $250 a year, on average.
  The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
    A: If some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the claim that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
    B: If the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time, then the claim that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
    C: If switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka, then the claim that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
    D: If few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the claim that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be strengthened.
    E: If people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders, then the claim that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  Therefore, the argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on choice C, which suggests that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument in the advertisement states that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
  Option A is possible because the survey only reports the average savings of $250, and some policyholders may have saved less or none at all.
  Option B is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  Option C is possible because the advertisement only compares Popelka to other insurance companies and does not consider other options that could save more money.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  Option E is possible because the advertisement does not provide information about the representativeness of the sample of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  Option A and Option E are both possible criticisms, but Option A is more directly related to the argument.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering. 
To support the position of the second group of doctors, we need to find a statement that reinforces the idea that bilirubin does not pose a significant risk to newborns. 
Option B supports the position of the second group of doctors by stating that some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter. This implies that in healthy newborns, the brain's natural defenses are sufficient to prevent bilirubin from entering and causing harm. 
Therefore, the answer is B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence provided is that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) had only one lapse in memory, while Group B (composed of college students) had fourteen lapses in memory.
  We need to find the statement that is least helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  If the statement does not affect the conclusion, then it is least helpful.

The statement "The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups" does not affect the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that Group A was better at remembering to make a telephone call than Group B.
  The argument concludes that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The conclusion is based on the premise that Group A performed better than Group B.
  To establish the conclusion, we need to show that the difference in performance is due to age and not other factors.
  Option B is least helpful because it does not provide any information about the memory of the participants.
  Answer: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The argument provides evidence that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) performed better than Group B (composed of college students) in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  The question asks which statement is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn.
  If a statement is not helpful in establishing the conclusion, it weakens the argument.
  Statement B is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it ensures that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups and thus eliminates any potential bias.
  Statement C is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it eliminates the possibility that the better performance of Group A was due to the presence of older college students.
  Statement D is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it ensures that both groups had the same resources and opportunities to make the required calls.
  Statement E is helpful in establishing the conclusion because it ensures that both groups had the same amount of time to prepare for the task.

  Therefore, the answer is C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages based on the study's results.
  To properly draw this conclusion, the study's results must be reliable and free from confounding factors.
  Answer choice A is helpful in establishing that the study's results are reliable because it ensures that the groups were of equal size.
  Answer choice B is helpful in establishing that the study's results are reliable because it ensures that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  Answer choice C is helpful in establishing that the study's results are reliable because it ensures that there were no older college students who could have influenced the results.
  Answer choice D is helpful in establishing that the study's results are reliable because it ensures that both groups had equal access to telephones.
  Answer choice E is helpful in establishing that the study's results are reliable because it ensures that both groups received their instructions at approximately the same time.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Resident: Data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in our town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe. Hence, at least 60 percent of our town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Question: The reasoning in the resident's argument is flawed in that the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the town has a relatively small number of houses
  B: inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe
  C: structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage
  D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe
  E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage
Response 0:
Thought:
  The resident's argument states that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The resident's argument states that 30% of houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects, which means that 60% of houses have some problem.
  The argument is flawed because it doesn't consider the possibility that some houses may have both problems, which means that the number of houses with problems could be less than 60%.
  Option E addresses this possibility, so it is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The resident's argument claims that 30% of houses have inadequate site drainage, and 30% have structural defects, but overlooks the possibility that some houses have neither of these problems.
  If some houses do not have these problems, then the claim that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity may be incorrect.
  Therefore, the answer is D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  The assumption that enables this conclusion to be properly drawn must support this argument.
  Choice A is similar to the argument but goes further than the argument.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is restating the argument.
  Choice D is similar to the argument, but it is not clear how it supports the argument.
  Choice E contradicts the argument.
  Therefore, the assumption that enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn is A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The conclusion of the argument is that Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about the events leading up to any action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed is false.
  To enable this conclusion to be properly drawn, we need to assume something that supports the idea that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily mean that the action was not freely performed.
  Choice B suggests that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  This assumption supports the idea that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily mean that the action was not freely performed.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.

  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is restating the argument.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E is opposite to the argument.
  Therefore, none of the choices enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The ethicist argues that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that knowing more about the events leading up to an action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The assumption that would enable the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn is one that supports the idea that knowing more about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily mean that the action was not freely performed.
  Choice B states that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This supports the idea that knowing more about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily mean that the action was not freely performed.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. 
Action: Answer("B")

Thought:
  The argument is about when we are justified in praising or blaming a person for an action.
  The argument rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn should support the argument and reject Tolstoy's claim.
  If we assume that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed, then we can reject Tolstoy's claim and support the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  We must reject Tolstoy's claim that knowing more about the events leading up to an action would make us not regard that action as freely performed.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn must connect the premise and the conclusion.
  Choice A is about actions that were caused by conditions beyond a person's control, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B suggests that how much information others possess about an act does not determine whether the person doing it is genuinely responsible, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C restates the premise and is not an assumption.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise varies with the amount of information available, which connects the premise and the conclusion.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The pharmacist's argument is that a study has shown that melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81.
  The pharmacist then concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
  The argument is flawed because the study does not prove that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the group that received magnets reported a significant reduction in pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the claim that magnetic fields are effective at relieving some back pain.
  Option A suggests that the mere knowledge of receiving a treatment can lead to improvement in the patient's condition, which could explain why most patients in the group that received magnets reported a significant reduction in pain.
  Option B is irrelevant to the physician's argument because the argument is not about whether medication is more effective than magnets.
  Option C is also irrelevant because the argument is only about back pain, not pain in other areas.
  Option D is also irrelevant because the beliefs of scientists who were not directly involved in conducting the experiment do not affect the validity of the experiment's results.
  Option E suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could have affected the results, making it difficult to conclude that magnetic fields are effective at relieving some back pain.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the physician's conclusion.
  Option A suggests that the improvement in the patient's condition may not be due to the magnetic fields but rather due to the patient's belief that they are receiving treatment.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about medication and not magnetic fields.
  Option C is also irrelevant as it talks about magnetic fields in other areas and not in the back.
  Option D is also irrelevant as it talks about the scientists who designed the experiment and not the effectiveness of magnetic fields.
  Option E suggests that the variation in the specific causes of chronic back pain may have influenced the results of the experiment.
  Option E weakens the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain as the variation in the specific causes of chronic back pain may have influenced the results of the experiment.
  Therefore, the answer is E.

  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could be a confounding variable that affects the validity of the experiment.
  Therefore, E is the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment done on 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  The logically strongest counter to the physician's argument should weaken the conclusion by providing a reason to doubt the causal relationship between magnetic fields and the reduction in pain.
  Option A is not a strong counter because it talks about a different effect on the patient's condition.
  Option B is not a strong counter because it is an opinion and not a fact.
  Option C is not a strong counter because it talks about a different area of pain.
  Option D is not a strong counter because it talks about the scientists who designed the experiment and not the experiment itself.
  Option E is a strong counter because it suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain could have been the reason for the difference in the reduction of pain between the two groups.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  We need to find the option that weakens the physician's argument.
  Option A suggests that the patients in the first group may have reported a reduction in pain because they knew they were receiving treatment, not because of the magnets.
  Option B is irrelevant as it does not address the effectiveness of magnets in relieving back pain.
  Option C is also irrelevant as it does not address the effectiveness of magnets in relieving back pain.
  Option D suggests that the scientists who designed the experiment may have had a bias towards magnetic fields, but this does not necessarily mean that the results are invalid.
  Option E suggests that the wide variation in the causes of chronic back pain may have affected the results of the experiment.
  Option E weakens the physician's argument by suggesting that the effectiveness of magnets in relieving chronic back pain may be dependent on the specific cause of the pain.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the surprising result?
Choices:
  A: For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
  B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
  C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers despite the latter being on sale.
  Option A is irrelevant to the question.
  Option B suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices, which contradicts the fact that all Maxlast hammers were sold out.
  Option C suggests that customers who bought Maxlast hammers did so because they were on sale, which supports the fact that low prices motivate customers.
  Option D suggests that the hardware store advertised the sale prices of Maxlast hammers, which may have attracted customers to the store.
  Option E is irrelevant to the question.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that Styron hammers slightly outsold Maxlast hammers despite Maxlast hammers being on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  Option C suggests that the sale on Maxlast hammers was the reason for the purchase, which does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option D suggests that the hardware store advertised the Maxlast hammer sale, which does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, which does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option A suggests that shoppers do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise for the first several seconds after entering the store, which could explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers. If shoppers did not notice the Maxlast hammers on sale, they may have purchased the Styron hammers instead.
  Option B suggests that most customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices, which does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, the answer is A: For the first several seconds after shoppers enter a store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  The Maxlast hammers were on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  We need to find the option that explains why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option C suggests that the customers who bought Maxlast hammers mentioned the sale as the reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  This implies that the sale was the reason for the purchase, and the customers were not loyal to any specific brand.
  Therefore, the sale on Maxlast hammers may have attracted customers who would usually buy Styron hammers.
  Thus, option C most explains the surprising result.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  Option A is not related to the surprising result.
  Option B suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices, which contradicts the fact that the Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Option C suggests that customers bought the Maxlast hammers because they were on sale, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option D suggests that the hardware store advertised the sale prices on Maxlast hammers, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  The most plausible explanation is that customers who were not in the market for a hammer did not notice the Maxlast hammers on sale and instead purchased the Styron hammers that were in their usual location. Therefore, the answer is A: For the first several seconds after shoppers enter a store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers, even though Maxlast hammers were on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  Option C provides a possible explanation for the surprising result.
  If customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, it suggests that the sale was a significant factor in their decision to buy the Maxlast hammers.
  This means that the sale may have drawn customers to the store who otherwise would not have come, and these customers may have purchased Styron hammers instead of Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, option C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:

  Option C provides a reason why customers bought Maxlast hammers last week.
  Option D provides information about the promotion of the sale.
  Option E provides general information about the effect of sales on shoppers.
  Options A and B do not provide any relevant information.
  Therefore, Option C could be the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the surprising result.
  Choice B suggests that the customers are not price-sensitive, which does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice C suggests that the Maxlast hammers were sold because they were on sale, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice D suggests that the customers were aware of the sale prices on Maxlast hammers, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, which does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, none of the given choices explain the surprising result.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  The Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  We need to find an option that explains why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the latter being on sale.
  Option C provides a possible explanation that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, which means that they may not have needed to buy another hammer this week.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Option A is not relevant to the surprising result.
  Option B suggests that customers are not price-sensitive and therefore does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option C suggests that customers who bought Maxlast hammers mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer. This does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option D explains that the hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers. This could have attracted more customers to the store, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store. This suggests that the customers who bought Styron hammers were already planning to buy a hammer and chose Styron hammers because they were already in the store and did not want to make a special trip to buy a Maxlast hammer on sale.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  Option C provides a possible explanation.
  If customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, it suggests that the sale was a significant factor in their decision.
  If the sale was a significant factor, then it is reasonable to assume that the absence of a sale on the Styron hammers was not a significant factor in the decision to purchase.
  Therefore, option C is the best answer.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez since Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Answer choice B suggests that most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, which contradicts the survey respondents' opinions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to provide an alternative explanation for why the survey respondents may have thought that Lopez's arguments were better.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide an alternative explanation for why the survey respondents may have thought that Lopez's arguments were better.
  Option B weakens the argument because it suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option C is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide an alternative explanation for why the survey respondents may have thought that Lopez's arguments were better.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument because it refers to viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate, not immediately after.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide an alternative explanation for why the survey respondents may have thought that Lopez's arguments were better.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B undermines the argument by providing evidence that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been representative of the live audience watching the debate.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez since he eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that suggests that the survey respondents' assessment of Lopez's arguments was not biased.
  Option B suggests that most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, which contradicts the survey respondents' assessment.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that the survey respondents were not biased in their assessment of Lopez's arguments.
  Option A is irrelevant because it talks about people who voted in the election, not the survey respondents.
  Option B is a potential answer because it suggests that the survey respondents may not have been accurate in their assessment of the debate.
  Option C is also irrelevant because it talks about people who did not watch the debate, not the survey respondents.
  Option D is also irrelevant because it talks about the viewers' intentions before the debate, not their actual assessment of the debate.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the margin of victory, not the accuracy of the survey respondents' assessment of the debate.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. This suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to show that there is another reason why the survey respondents may have thought that Lopez's arguments were better.
  Choice B provides an alternative explanation for why the survey respondents may have thought that Lopez's arguments were better.
  If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been biased in favor of Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.

  Choice B suggests that the survey respondents who thought that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez, but it does not provide an alternative explanation for why they thought that.
  Choice C is also not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D does not undermine the argument because the survey was conducted prior to the debate, not after.
  Choice E suggests that Lopez's victory was not a foregone conclusion, which weakens the argument that the survey respondents who thought that Lopez's arguments were better were biased in his favor.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.

Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.

  Therefore, the number of paychecks per pay period would not provide an accurate estimate of the number of people employed in the first quarter.
  Option A is incorrect because there is no information to suggest that the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  Option B is incorrect because there is no information to suggest that the people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.

  The program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  Therefore, the government's estimate of employment may have included multiple paychecks for the same employee.
  This means that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

  Therefore, the number of paychecks per pay period does not accurately reflect the number of people employed in X.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Therefore, the government's estimate of the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used was likely overestimated.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The new program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  Therefore, the number of paychecks issued per pay period would be higher than the actual number of people employed in X.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.

  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the new program would count more paychecks per employee than the previous method.
  This would lead to an overestimation of the number of people employed in X.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an option that suggests an alternative explanation for the presence of the iguana species on the islands.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B does not weaken the argument, as genetic differences do not preclude the possibility of rafting.
  Option C is also irrelevant, as the rarity of documented cases does not disprove the possibility of rafting.
  Option D is irrelevant, as it only suggests that related species existed in Australia, not that the species on the islands came from there.
  Option E suggests that the iguana species may have existed on the islands prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, which would weaken the argument that they rafted on floating debris from the Americas.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this argument.
  If there is evidence that the iguanas did not come from the Americas, then the argument would be weakened.
  Choice A, B, C, and D do not contradict the argument.
  Choice E suggests that the iguanas could have come from a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, which would contradict the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an option that contradicts this argument.
  Option A does not contradict the argument and is irrelevant.
  Option B does not contradict the argument and is also irrelevant.
  Option C suggests that iguanas rafting long distances between land masses is uncommon, but it does not contradict the argument.
  Option D suggests that fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia. This contradicts the argument that the iguanas must have rafted from the Americas.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands came from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an option that contradicts this claim.
  Option A, which states that some animal species on the islands are not found in the Americas, does not weaken the argument.
  Option B, which says that the iguana species on the islands are genetically different from those in the Americas, also does not weaken the argument.
  Option C, which suggests that documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances are uncommon, does not contradict the argument.
  Option D, which states that fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, weakens the argument.
  Option E, which states that the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, is irrelevant to the argument.

  C is a possible answer because it suggests that iguanas may not be able to raft long distances.
  D does not weaken the argument, it supports it.
  E is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an option that contradicts this idea.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B does not contradict the argument, but rather supports the idea that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D contradicts the argument, as it suggests that the iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, which means that they did not necessarily come from the Americas.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the idea that the iguanas came from the Americas.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant since it only states that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, but it does not contradict the idea that they came from the Americas.
  Choice C is also irrelevant since it only states that documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon, but it does not contradict the idea that they came from the Americas.
  Choice D is also irrelevant since it only states that fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, but it does not contradict the idea that they came from the Americas.
  Choice E contradicts the idea that the iguanas came from the Americas by stating that numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.

Response 7:
Thought: 
  The scientist's argument is that the species of iguana on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this argument.
  Choice A does not contradict the argument, as the argument does not claim that all animal species on the islands are found in the Americas.
  Choice B also does not contradict the argument, as genetic differences do not necessarily mean that the species did not originate in the Americas.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not claim that rafting is a common occurrence.
  Choice D contradicts the argument, as fossils of closely related iguana species have been found in Australia, which suggests that the progenitors of the species on the islands may have come from Australia instead of the Americas.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument, as it does not address the origin of the iguana species in question.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is that the iguana species on the islands rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an alternative explanation for how the iguana species arrived on the islands.

  Choice B also does not provide an alternative explanation but rather suggests that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas.
  Choice C weakens the argument but does not provide an alternative explanation.
  Choice D suggests that the iguana species may have originated from Australia rather than the Americas, which weakens the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it does not provide an alternative explanation.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this claim.
Option A, B, and D do not contradict the scientist's argument.
Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
Option E suggests that the iguanas could have existed in the area before the fragmentation of Gondwana, which is before the formation of the islands. This means that the iguanas could have already been on the islands before they were formed, which weakens the scientist's argument.
Therefore, the answer is E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The council members argue that the increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist claims that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports this conclusion by stating that statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument does not address the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  The argument does not address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
  The argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  The argument does not conclude that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
  The argument does not take statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
  The answer is B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports this conclusion by stating that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks other possibilities that could affect the safety of bicyclists.
  Option A is a possibility that the argument overlooks.
  The argument does not address the possibility mentioned in option B.
  Option C is not relevant to the argument.
  Option D is not a valid criticism of the argument.
  Option E is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes than on roads without them.
  The argument assumes that the number of collisions is the only factor that determines the safety of bicyclists.
  However, there may be other factors that affect the safety of bicyclists, such as the severity of injuries sustained in accidents.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it does not address other factors that may contribute to the higher number of collisions on roads with bicycle lanes.
  Choice A addresses the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  This criticism would be relevant because even if the number of collisions is higher on roads with bicycle lanes, if the injuries are less severe, then adding bicycle lanes could still enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  Therefore, the answer is A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes. 
Action: Answer("A")

  This is a valid criticism of the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it does not consider other factors that may affect the safety of bicyclists.
  Option A raises the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  Option B raises the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
  Option C raises the possibility that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists may not necessarily enhance the safety of motorists.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that using a blender to whip cream results in a thick, velvety substance because the container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively.
  The passage also states that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

  The argument states that a diet whose protein comes from fish is healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat.
  However, if everyone were to adopt this diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible.
  The argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  Option A discusses the safety of vitamin E supplements and concludes that we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  Option B discusses the effects of high taxes on tobacco and concludes that such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  Option C discusses the benefits of limiting purchases to what one truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income, but concludes that we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  Option D discusses the relationship between campaigning and getting reelected, but does not resemble the argument above.
  Option E discusses the effects of restricting land development in wilderness areas and concludes that it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not the only source of distraction in the workplace and that other sources of distraction, such as windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  A similar argument would point out that there are other sources of harm besides the one being focused on, and that the harm being focused on is not necessarily the most significant one.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee success, as other elements are also important.
  This argument is similar to the employee's argument, as both point out that focusing on one aspect of a larger issue does not necessarily lead to the desired outcome.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions are not filtered.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale because other elements are also important.
  Both arguments claim that a single factor does not have a significant impact on the outcome.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to increase productivity because other distractions, such as windows or decorations, are not banned. 
  The argument implies that if the company wants to ban distractions, it should ban all of them, not just some.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee that a novel or story will sell. 
  The argument implies that creating engaging characters is not enough to ensure success, and other elements are also important.
  Therefore, the most similar argument to the employee's is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The employee argues that website filtering software is not the only distraction in the workplace, and that other distractions such as windows and decorations are not being addressed.
Choice D discusses how creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale, and that publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
The reasoning in choice D is similar to the employee's argument because just as the employee argues that website filtering software is not the only distraction in the workplace, choice D argues that creating engaging characters is not the only factor in ensuring a successful novel or story.
Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
The employee argues that the company's website filtering software is not the only source of distraction, and therefore, it is unfair to single out websites as the cause of distraction. 
Option D argues that while engaging characters are important in creative writing, publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Both arguments consider a single factor to be insufficient in achieving a desired outcome. 
Therefore, option D is the most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace.
  The argument must be similar in reasoning.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters is not enough to guarantee a sale.
  This is similar because the argument states that one factor is not enough to guarantee a certain outcome.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as windows and decorations, are not banned.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee success because publishers and agents may reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  Both arguments point out that a single factor is not the only determinant of success.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary, as it is not the only factor that can cause distractions. There are other factors, such as offices with windows or decorations, that can also be distracting. 
Option D seems to have a similar structure of argument. It argues that creating engaging characters is not enough to guarantee the success of a novel or story. Other elements are also important, and publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that focus only on character development.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to improve productivity since other distractions, such as windows and decorations, are not eliminated. 
  The argument that is most similar in reasoning would be one that argues that a certain measure is not necessary because there are other factors that are not being considered.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee the success of a novel or story because other elements are also important.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If grain prices double then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that the price of grain-fed beef will almost double while the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  The question is asking which of the following would most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon.
  Option A is irrelevant to the phenomenon.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the phenomenon.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the phenomenon.
  Option D indicates that the majority of beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grain, which supports the phenomenon.
  Option E is irrelevant to the phenomenon.
  Therefore, option D is the best answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that when grain prices double, the price of a loaf of bread rises between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef comes close to doubling.
  To explain this phenomenon, we need to find an option that shows why the price of beef increases more than the price of bread.
  Option A talks about the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef, which is not relevant to the given phenomenon.
  Option B talks about the wholesale price of beef and bread, which is not relevant to the given phenomenon.
  Option C talks about the cost of producing bread and beef, which is not relevant to the given phenomenon.
  Option D talks about the proportion of beef produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, which is not relevant to the given phenomenon.
  Option E talks about the retail grocery outlets and how they purchase bread and meat, which could be relevant to the given phenomenon.
  If the vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase meat from large wholesale processing operations, then it is possible that the price of beef is more affected by changes in grain prices than the price of bread, which is purchased from small independent bakers.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described above is that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling while the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double.
  The question is asking which statement would most contribute to an explanation of this phenomenon.
  If the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef, then an increase in grain prices would significantly increase the cost of producing beef, which would explain why the price of grain-fed beef would come close to doubling.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described above is that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling while the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  The question asks which of the following would most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon.
  Option A talks about labor costs in cattle production which is not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Option B talks about the wholesale price per pound of beef and bread, which is not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Option C talks about the cost of producing bread and beef, which is not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Option D talks about the proportion of beef sold in retail markets that is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, which is not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Option E talks about where retail grocery outlets purchase bread and meat, which could be relevant to the phenomenon as it suggests that the market structure for bread and meat is different.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling while the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double.
  Choice B is irrelevant because the comparison of wholesale prices of bread and beef is not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because it talks about the cost of producing bread and beef, which is not related to the phenomenon.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it talks about the proportion of beef sold in retail markets that is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, which is not related to the phenomenon.
  Choice A is somewhat relevant because it talks about the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef, but it does not explain why the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  Choice E is the most relevant because it explains that retail grocery outlets purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations. This suggests that the price of beef is more susceptible to changes in grain prices because it is produced on a larger scale and is subject to more centralized pricing.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling while the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double.
  The question is asking for the option that explains the phenomenon the most.
  Option B provides information about the wholesale price per pound of beef and bread, but it doesn't explain why the price of beef will come close to doubling while the average price of bread will only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Option C provides information about the cost of producing bread and beef, but it doesn't explain why the price of beef will come close to doubling while the average price of bread will only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Option D provides information about the proportion of beef sold in retail markets that is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, but it doesn't explain why the price of beef will come close to doubling while the average price of bread will only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Option E provides information about the retail grocery outlets that purchase the bread and meat they sell, but it doesn't explain why the price of beef will come close to doubling while the average price of bread will only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Option A provides information about the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef, which could explain why the price of beef will come close to doubling. If farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef, they may choose to feed their cattle with grain instead of grass. This could increase the demand for grain, which could drive up its price. Therefore, Option A is the best answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described above is that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling while the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double.
  The question is asking which of the following would contribute to an explanation of this phenomenon.
  Choice A is about labor costs in beef production and does not explain the phenomenon.
  Choice B is about the wholesale price of beef and bread, but it does not explain why the price of beef will come close to doubling while the price of bread will only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Choice C is about the cost of producing bread and beef, but it does not explain why the price of beef will come close to doubling while the price of bread will only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Choice D is about the proportion of beef produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, but it does not explain the phenomenon.
  Choice E is about the retail grocery outlets that purchase bread and meat, but it does not explain why the price of beef will come close to doubling while the price of bread will only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Therefore, the best answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("E")

  Option A does not explain the phenomenon.
  Option B is irrelevant to the phenomenon.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the phenomenon.
  Option D provides some explanation for the phenomenon, but not the most significant one.
  Option E explains that the vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations, which means that the price of beef is more affected by the increase in grain prices than the price of bread.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Grain prices doubling causes a 10-15% increase in the price of bread and almost a doubling of the price of beef.
  The question asks which statement explains this phenomenon the most.
  Option A is irrelevant to the phenomenon.
  Option B is also irrelevant because it talks about the difference in wholesale prices of bread and beef.
  Option C is partially relevant because it talks about the costs of producing bread and beef, but it does not explain the phenomenon.
  Option D is relevant because it talks about the proportion of beef that is produced from grain-fed cattle, which is likely to be the main reason for the increase in beef prices.
  Option E is irrelevant to the phenomenon.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find a statement that supports this claim.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is already mentioned in the context and does not add anything new.
  Option C contradicts the argument and weakens the researcher's claim.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E, if true, would support the researcher's claim by stating that lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  The researcher compared the results of lichen's copper concentration with mechanical monitoring devices and found that they were as accurate as the best equipment available.
  We need to find an option that supports the researcher's argument.
  Option B supports the argument by saying that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  If copper is a component of air pollution in several locales, then the researcher's method of using lichens to monitor air pollution can be applied in several places.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to provide additional evidence that supports the researcher's claim.
  Choice B provides additional evidence that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales, which strengthens the researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("B")

  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to provide additional evidence that supports the claim.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is somewhat relevant but does not directly support the argument.
  Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E provides additional evidence that supports the claim that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports the idea that lichens are just as effective as mechanical monitoring devices.
  Answer choice B supports the idea that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales, which strengthens the researcher's argument that lichens can be used to monitor air quality.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The researcher argues that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  The researcher supports this argument by stating that the lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available in monitoring copper pollution.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices for other pollutants as well.
  Option B states that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  This strengthens the argument because it implies that lichens can be used to monitor air quality in several locales.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that lichens are a reliable and cost-effective alternative to mechanical monitoring devices.

  This statement supports the researcher's argument by indicating that copper is not a unique pollutant, and therefore, the results of the study can be generalized to other areas.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The researcher argues that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to find a statement that supports the idea that lichens are a reliable and cost-effective way to monitor air pollution.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  The question asks which statement undermines the argument's reasoning.
  If a statement shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid, then it would undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A is not relevant to the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice B is not relevant to the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning and is not undermining it.
  Choice D is not relevant to the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice E shows that there are more people who harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis, but it is not clear how this undermines the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, none of the choices undermines the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal despite the fact that it allegedly strengthens the immune response because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument then compares this to M tuberculosis, which also causes disease in some people, but is not considered a commensal.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed.
  Choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which suggests that the comparison is indeed flawed.
  If people derive no benefit from M tuberculosis, then it is not comparable to H pylori, which allegedly strengthens the immune response.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows why H pylori is more similar to a commensal than M tuberculosis is.
  Choice C suggests that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which implies that M tuberculosis is less like a commensal than H pylori.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal despite its alleged immune-strengthening effects because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The comparison to M tuberculosis is that it also causes disease in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  To undermine this reasoning, we need to show that there is a relevant difference between the two bacteria that makes it reasonable to consider one a commensal and not the other.
  Choice C, if true, provides such a difference: people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, whereas H pylori allegedly strengthens immune response.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it can cause stomach ulcers, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response. 
  The comparison to M tuberculosis is that it can also cause illness, but no one would consider it a commensal.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that the comparison to M tuberculosis is flawed.
  Choice C suggests that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which suggests that the comparison is not valid.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers and not everyone who harbors it gets sick.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which also does not make everyone who harbors it sick.
  The argument assumes that the only reason H pylori is considered a commensal is because it allegedly strengthens the immune response.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which suggests that the comparison is not valid because H pylori is alleged to provide some benefit.
  Therefore, the answer is C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument is that just because H pylori allegedly strengthens the immune response and only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of people, it does not mean that it is a commensal.
  The comparison is made with M tuberculosis, which also only causes sickness in less than 10% of people who harbor it, but no one considers it a commensal.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that weakens the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice C, which states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, weakens the comparison between the two bacteria because it implies that M tuberculosis is not a commensal, while H pylori is being considered a commensal despite causing harm.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  It compares this to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal despite the fact that it causes disease in only some people.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a difference between the two cases that would justify treating them differently.
  Choice C, which states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, is a relevant difference between the two cases.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument then compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis in some people, but is not considered a commensal.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  A, B, C, and D do not address the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  E shows that more people harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis, which could be seen as supporting the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal despite the fact that it only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of people.
  The reasoning is that M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal even though only 10% of people who harbor it get sick.
  To undermine this reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that M tuberculosis and H pylori are not comparable in the way the argument suggests.
  Choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which is a key difference from H pylori.
  Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

  The evidence cited is an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We need to find the option that casts the most doubt on the validity of this evidence.
  Option A tells us that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times. This doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, as the bear could still have navigated over a considerable distance before stopping and changing course.
  Option B tells us that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This also doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, as the bear could still have navigated over a considerable distance to get back to its home territory.
  Option C tells us that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice. This doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, as the bear could still have navigated over a considerable distance through these conditions.
  Option D tells us that other species of mammal have also been known to find their way home from considerable distances. This doesn't necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, as it doesn't specifically address the polar bear's ability to navigate over a considerable distance.
  Option E tells us that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory. This casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence, as it suggests that the polar bear may have relied on its sense of smell rather than its ability to navigate over a considerable distance to find its way home.

  The question asks which of the following casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  If the polar bear had some advantage or help in finding its way back home, then the naturalists' claim would be weakened.
  Choice B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, which would make it easier for the bear to find its way home.
  Choice C suggests that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, which would make it more difficult for the bear to find its way home.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the evidence cited.
  Choice E suggests that polar bears rely on their sense of smell to find their way home, which would support the naturalists' claim.
  Choice A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times, which could indicate that the bear was not sure of its way home.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that high-fiber diets are associated with lower colon cancer rates.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if there is another factor that explains the correlation between high-fiber diets and lower colon cancer rates.
  Choice B suggests that high-fiber diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer, which would strengthen the argument rather than criticize it.
  Choice C suggests that including fiber in one's diet may be difficult, but this does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D suggests that different types of fiber have different effects on cancer, but this does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E suggests that other substances in fiber-containing foods may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, which would explain the correlation between high-fiber diets and lower colon cancer rates.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer.
  The argument supports this claim with evidence from studies.
  The argument does not consider other factors that may affect colon cancer rates.
  Therefore, the argument may be vulnerable to criticism.
  To answer the question, we need to find an option that identifies a possible flaw in the argument's reasoning.
  Option B suggests that high-fiber diets may reduce the risk of other types of cancer, but this does not necessarily contradict the argument's claim about colon cancer.
  Option C suggests that some people may have difficulty including fiber in their diets, but this does not necessarily contradict the argument's claim either.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument's claim about colon cancer and fiber.
  Option D may be a possible flaw, but the argument does not make any claims about the relative cancer-fighting properties of different types of fiber.
  Option E suggests that other substances in fiber-containing foods may also prevent colon cancer, which could be a possible flaw in the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument supports this claim by citing studies that show a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  The question asks for a criticism of the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A is irrelevant because the argument is not concerned with changes in fiber consumption over time.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because the argument is only concerned with colon cancer.
  Choice C is not a valid criticism because the argument does not claim that everyone can easily include fiber in their diets.
  Choice D is a possible criticism because the argument assumes that all fiber is equally effective in preventing colon cancer.
  Choice E is a possible criticism because the argument assumes that fiber is the only substance in foods that can prevent colon cancer.
  The best answer is either D or E, but since E is more general and includes D, it is the better answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries than in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  In Scandinavia, it has been shown that the higher the colon cancer rate, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that some other factors may be responsible for the observed correlation.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant because the argument does not talk about the difficulty of including fiber in people's diets.
  Choice D is a possibility, but the argument does not address it.
  Choice E is the most likely answer because the argument does not consider the possibility that other substances in fiber-rich foods may be responsible for preventing colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer.
  The argument cites evidence that colon cancer rates are lower in countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The question asks for a criticism of the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant because the argument does not address the difficulty of including fiber in one's diet.
  Choice D is a possibility, but the argument does not address the issue of different types of fiber having different effects on cancer.
  Choice E is a possibility because the argument does not address the possibility that other substances in fiber-rich foods may be responsible for the lower incidence of colon cancer.
  Choice E is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("E")

  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
  The argument provides evidence to support this claim.
  The question asks for a criticism that the argument overlooks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is also not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument because it suggests that the cancer-fighting properties of other substances in foods containing fther could be responsible for the lower incidence of colon cancer in non-Western countries.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument uses the evidence of negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence in Western and non-Western countries.
  The argument also uses the evidence from Scandinavia that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  To criticize the argument's reasoning, we need to find a possibility that the argument overlooks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is out of scope. The argument only talks about colon cancer.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument's conclusion that fiber prevents colon cancer.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument's reasoning. The argument does not compare the cancer-fighting properties of different types of fiber.
  Choice E is the most likely answer because it suggests that the argument overlooks the possibility that other substances in foods containing fiber may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, rather than fiber itself.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:

  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not discuss the difficulty of including fther in a diet.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not compare the cancer-fighting properties of fther in fruits and vegetables and fther in cereals.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument because the argument does not consider the possibility that other substances in foods containing fther tend to prevent colon cancer.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is about the relationship between fther consumption and colon cancer.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that contradicts the conclusion.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C might be a possible criticism, but it does not contradict the conclusion.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E is the most likely answer because it suggests that the other substances in foods containing fther might have a more significant impact on preventing colon cancer than fther itself.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer.
  The argument supports the claim with evidence from studies and comparisons of colon cancer rates in different countries.
  The question asks for a criticism that the argument overlooks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning about the relationship between fther and colon cancer.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because the argument only focuses on colon cancer.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because the argument does not address the difficulty of including fther in diets.
  Choice D is a possible criticism because the argument assumes that all types of fther have the same effect on colon cancer, but this may not be true.
  Choice E is also a possible criticism because the argument assumes that fther is the only factor in preventing colon cancer, but this may not be true.
  Between D and E, choice E is a stronger criticism because it challenges the argument's assumption more directly.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks living in captivity are susceptible to diseases that they would not be exposed to in the wild, yet their life expectancy is about the same as those living in the wild.
  Therefore, we need to find an answer choice that explains how the leatherbacks in captivity are able to live as long as those in the wild despite being exposed to diseases.
  Option A, B, C, D, and E do not provide a clear explanation for the apparent discrepancy.
  However, option C suggests that the leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, which implies that the ones that survive in the wild are the ones that are not attacked by predators, and therefore, are not exposed to diseases that they would not be exposed to in captivity.
  Therefore, option C most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases, but they still have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the fatal diseases do not affect the life expectancy of the leatherbacks in captivity.
  Option C suggests that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, which means that they do not die due to the fatal diseases.
  Therefore, option C helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild, yet their life expectancy is the same in both environments.
  The resolution to this discrepancy would be an explanation of why the life expectancy of leatherbacks in captivity is not lower than that of leatherbacks in the wild.
  Option C provides a possible explanation for why the life expectancy of leatherbacks in the wild is not higher than that of leatherbacks in captivity.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild, yet their likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  There must be a reason why the fatal diseases do not affect the leatherbacks' life expectancy in captivity.
  The correct answer should provide an explanation for this.
  (A) and (B) are irrelevant to the argument.
  (C) explains why leatherbacks in the wild may not reach their maximum life expectancy, but it does not address the issue of leatherbacks in captivity.
  (D) is a possible reason why leatherbacks in captivity may not reach their maximum life expectancy, but it does not explain why they are not affected by fatal diseases.
  (E) does not address the issue of fatal diseases.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but they still reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy whether they are in captivity or in the wild.
  We need to find an option that resolves this discrepancy.
  Option C provides a reason why the leatherbacks in the wild might not reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy.
  If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then it is possible that the ones that survive are the ones that are healthy and can reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy.
  Therefore, option C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild, yet their likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy is the same as those living in the wild.
  The resolution to this discrepancy must explain why leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases but still live as long as those in the wild.
  Choice A is irrelevant as it does not address the discrepancy.
  Choice B is also irrelevant as it does not address the discrepancy.
  Choice C is also irrelevant as it does not address the discrepancy.
  Choice D is not helpful in resolving the discrepancy as it only talks about the knowledge of zoologists.
  Choice E, however, could help resolve the discrepancy as it suggests that the size of a leatherback is not a reliable indicator of its age which means that captive leatherbacks may not be as old as they appear to be based on their size. If this is true, it could explain why they are susceptible to fatal diseases and yet still live as long as those in the wild.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild.
  The argument also states that the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between the two statements.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both situations despite the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Option C provides a possible explanation for the discrepancy by stating that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, not diseases.
  If this is true, then the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity may not be as significant a factor in determining life expectancy as predation is in the wild.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild.
  However, the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is the same whether it is in captivity or in the wild.
  The discrepancy is why leatherbacks living in captivity, with their susceptibility to fatal diseases, have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those living in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for both.
  Option C states that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, which means that the ones that survive are less susceptible to fatal diseases.
  This explanation helps to resolve the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity but still have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity does not affect their life expectancy.
  Option C provides a reason why the susceptibility to diseases in captivity does not affect their life expectancy.
  If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, it means that diseases are not the leading cause of death in the wild.
  Therefore, the likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and the wild.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have similar likelihoods of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
  However, the argument also states that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a statement that explains why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is similar in both cases despite the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Choice C provides a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is similar in both cases. If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then it is possible that the leatherbacks that survive in the wild are the ones that are less susceptible to predators and diseases. Therefore, the leatherbacks that survive in the wild are more likely to reach their maximum life expectancy.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true

  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
  Choice A is incorrect because the journalist only stated that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, but not all celestial objects without lithium are stars with less mass than the Sun.
  Choice B is incorrect because the journalist only stated that stars with lithium have incomplete mixing of elements, but not all celestial objects with incomplete mixing of elements have lithium.
  Choice C is incorrect because the journalist only stated that brown dwarfs do not have lithium, but not all celestial objects without lithium are brown dwarfs.
  Choice D is incorrect because the journalist only stated that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium, but not all celestial objects with lithium have at least as much mass as the Sun.
  The journalist stated that brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. They also stated that brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed. Therefore, no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
  Therefore, any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  The statement that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf is not supported by the information provided.
  The statement that no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun is not supported by the information provided.
  The statement that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere is not supported by the information provided.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Lithium is present in the atmospheres of stars with at least the same mass as the Sun.
  Lithium is not present in the atmospheres of stars with less mass than the Sun.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace, so lithium cannot be consumed.
  Therefore, brown dwarfs do not have lithium in their atmospheres.
  The journalist did not provide any information to support choices A, B, D, or E.
  Choice C is consistent with the journalist's statements.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Lithium is present in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs.
  Lithium is present in the atmospheres of stars at least as massive as the Sun.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium in their atmospheres.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so their lithium cannot be consumed.
  Therefore, the presence of lithium in an object's atmosphere is not indicative of whether or not the object is a star.
  The journalist does not provide information about the presence of lithium in objects less massive than brown dwarfs.
  The journalist does not provide information about whether or not brown dwarfs have more mass than stars at least as massive as the Sun.
  The journalist does not provide information about whether or not celestial objects without lithium in their atmospheres are stars with less mass than the Sun.
  The journalist states that brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so their lithium cannot be consumed.
  Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the journalist's statements is that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  The answer is C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find the option that supports the publisher's prediction.
  Option A is not relevant to the prediction.
  Option B does not provide any information about the sales.
  Option C is not enough to support the prediction.
  Option D is not relevant to the prediction.
  Option E suggests that some people buy the game after completing it and give it away to a friend. This indicates that the game is popular and has a good reputation. This option supports the publisher's prediction.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that sales of the game will soon exceed expectations.
  The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals.
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  Therefore, the publisher's prediction is most likely to be justified if the rebate offer is effective in encouraging renters to purchase the game after renting it.
Action: Answer("B") 
Justification: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then renters are more likely to purchase the game after renting it to avoid having to rent it multiple times to complete it. This would justify the publisher's prediction that sales of the game will soon exceed expectations.
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports this prediction.
  Option A is irrelevant as it does not provide any information on sales or rentals.
  Option B is irrelevant as it provides information on the time taken by players to complete the game, but it does not provide any information on sales or rentals.
  Option C is irrelevant as it provides information on the popularity of the publisher's games, but it does not provide any information on sales or rentals of this particular game.
  Option D weakens the prediction as it suggests that most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, which may reduce the chances of them recommending the game to others.
  Option E is also irrelevant as it provides information on what some people do after buying and completing the game, but it does not provide any information on sales or rentals.
  Therefore, none of the given options support the prediction.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The publisher's prediction is that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals.
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  Therefore, the publisher's prediction would be justified if more people are renting the game and then purchasing it after the rebate offer.
  Choice B does not help to justify the prediction because it does not provide information about sales or rentals.
  Choice C is not relevant to the prediction.
  Choice D weakens the prediction because it suggests that people who complete the game do not have a reason to purchase it.
  Choice E is not relevant to the prediction.
  Choice A provides an alternative way to purchase the game that does not affect the prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that sales will increase.
  Option A does not provide any information about the future sales of the game.
  Option B implies that it will take longer for players to complete the game, which could lead to a decrease in rentals and an increase in purchases.
  Option C suggests that the publisher's games are popular, but it does not provide any information about the future sales of this particular game.
  Option D implies that players will not continue to play the game after completing it, which could lead to an increase in purchases.
  Option E does not provide any information about the future sales of the game.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that sales of the game will soon exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find a statement that shows that people are likely to buy the game after renting it.
  If people are likely to buy the game after renting it, then the rebate offer will encourage them to do so.
  Choice B is irrelevant because it does not show that people are likely to buy the game after renting it.
  Choice A is not relevant because it does not show that people are likely to buy the game after renting it.
  Choice C is not relevant because it does not show that people are likely to buy the game after renting it.
  Choice D is not relevant because it does not show that people are likely to buy the game after renting it.
  Choice E is not relevant because it does not show that people are likely to buy the game after renting it.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices help to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports this prediction.
  Option B states that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  This means that players who rented the game may need to rent it multiple times before they complete it.
  Therefore, it is likely that renters who played the game multiple times would prefer to purchase the game, which comes with a rebate equal to the cost of one rental.
  This supports the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  The rebate offer may encourage renters to purchase the game.
  To justify the publisher's prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that renters will purchase the game.
  Option B is irrelevant to the publisher's prediction.
  Option A, C, and E do not provide a clear reason why renters will purchase the game.
  Option D suggests that most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, which means that they may want to purchase the game instead of renting it again.
  Therefore, option D most helps to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that explains why sales of the game will increase.
  Option A is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option B is also irrelevant because the time taken by players to complete the game is not related to sales.
  Option C is not enough to justify the prediction.
  Option D is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  Therefore, none of the given options justifies the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find a choice that supports this prediction.
  The fact that rentals are exceeding expectations is a good sign.
  We need to find a choice that further supports the idea that people will eventually buy the game.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Choice A is also irrelevant because it only provides an alternative way to purchase the game.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because it only talks about the publisher's reputation.
  Choice D is actually against the prediction because it suggests that people will not buy the game after completing it.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it talks about people giving the game away, not buying it.
  Therefore, none of the choices help to justify the prediction.

Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that if the party's economic theories were sound, then the inflation rate would have lessened.
  The inflation rate actually increased, therefore, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The argument concludes that the party's economic theories were flawed because the inflation rate increased.
  Choice C has a similar flawed reasoning. It suggests that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Therefore, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  The argument concludes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries because the stock price did not increase, which is a flawed reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have decreased. However, the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were flawed.
  Choice C is similar because it states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Therefore, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that if the party's economic theories were sound, the inflation rate would have lessened.
  But the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
  Therefore, the argument assumes that the party's economic theories were the only factor that could have affected the inflation rate.
  The flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
  Choice C suggests that the company's failure to sell its subsidiaries is the only reason why the stock price did not increase in the last two years.
  This is similar to the argument above, which suggests that the party's economic theories were the only factor that could have affected the inflation rate.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have decreased. However, the inflation rate actually increased. Therefore, the party's economic theories were far off the mark.
  Option C has a similar flawed reasoning. It states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Therefore, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  Both arguments have a similar structure where a conditional statement is made, and the opposite of the expected outcome occurs, leading to a conclusion that the condition was not met.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, then the inflation rate would have decreased. However, the inflation rate increased instead. Therefore, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  Choice C has a similar flawed reasoning where it states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, then the stock price would have doubled in the last two years.

  The argument above states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have decreased, but it actually increased. Therefore, the party's economic theories were far off the mark.
  Choice A argues that if the valley people had been invaded or there had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture, but the architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Therefore, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay. This argument assumes that the only reason for changes in architecture is invasion or climatic change, which is flawed.
  Choice B argues that many people fear that if the opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike, but because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This argument assumes that the workers' promise not to strike is based on their belief that the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut, which is flawed.
  Choice C argues that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years, but the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Therefore, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This argument assumes that the only reason for the stock price not to increase is the company's failure to sell its subsidiaries, which is flawed.
  Choice D argues that city residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels if the battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle. This argument assumes that the only reason for the residents' support is the rebels' victory, which is flawed.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers we have is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations.
  The argument would be strengthened if it could be shown that the number of fingers we have is not the only possible configuration.
  Choice E provides evidence that at least one species of fish had a different number of phalanges in its fins.
  Therefore, choice E most strengthens the biologist's argument.
Action: Answer("E")

  The biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  The biologist also argues that if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
  The answer choice that would strengthen the biologist's argument would support the idea that humans are content with different configurations of fingers.
  Answer choice A does not support the idea that humans are content with different configurations of fingers.
  Answer choice B is too extreme and does not support the idea that humans are content with different configurations of fingers.
  Answer choice C supports the idea that humans are content with different configurations of fingers, but it is too absolute.
  Answer choice D supports the idea that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices, but it does not directly support the idea that humans are content with different configurations of fingers.
  Answer choice E supports the idea that different species of fish have different configurations of fingers, which indirectly supports the idea that humans are content with different configurations of fingers.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:

  Option B suggests that persons outside the corporation could have had access to internal financial records, which weakens the argument.
  Option C suggests that there were more accountants than actuaries, which weakens the argument.
  Option D suggests that the corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement, which weakens the argument.
  Option E suggests that the security measures favored the accountants, which weakens the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.

Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone.
  B: I have no reason to think that the practical joke I want to play would harm anyone. So, since the joke would show no contempt for the person the joke is played on, it would not be wrong for me to play it.
  C: Because of the circumstances, it would be wrong for me to play the practical joke I had intended to play on you. Even though it would not show contempt for anyone, it could easily bring you significant harm.
  D: It would have been wrong for me to play the practical joke that I had intended to play on you. Even though I did not have reason to think that it would significantly harm anyone, I did think that it would show contempt for someone.
  E: Someone was harmed as a result of my practical joke. Thus, even though it did not show contempt for the person I played the joke on, I should not have played it.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?

  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  We need to find an option that explains this difference.
  Option A is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option B is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option C is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option D explains that the sponsors are concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. Hence, the primary goal of the television executives is to attract viewers who have purchasing power, not necessarily to maximize the number of viewers.
  Option E is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

  The difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives needs to be explained.
  Option A does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Option B talks about the profits of movie theaters and not the goals of movie executives and television executives.
  Option C talks about the cost of producing an hour of film and television, but it does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Option D suggests that television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. This explains that television executives are more concerned with the purchasing power of their viewers than with the number of viewers.

Topic: Law
Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Question: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.

  Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  From the above information, we can infer that:
  - Every print in the museum store is not of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection because the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  - Every print that is sold in the museum store is not a copy of a twentieth-century work because the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  - There are prints in the museum store of some works that are displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector, but not necessarily every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  - We don't have enough information to determine whether Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan to the museum from a private collector or not.
  - We don't have enough information to determine whether Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum or not.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.

  Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  Therefore, A and C cannot be true.
  The statement does not provide any information about the loan status of Hopper's Nighthawks.
  The statement only mentions that prints of all of the museum's permanent collection works are available in the museum store.
  Therefore, B is not necessarily true.
  Hopper's Nighthawks is mentioned as an example of a work that is not part of the museum's permanent collection.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries, making trial by jury unfair for disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  The correct answer should show that trial by jury is still a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Choice A strengthens the argument by saying that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony.
  Choice B weakens the argument by suggesting that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced in favor of one party.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E does not address the issue of whether trial by jury is a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that juries are not fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that juries are still fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Choice A supports the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge are less likely to comprehend the testimony given.
  Choice B also supports the argument by stating that jurors with specialized knowledge are more likely to be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument because it discusses the fairness of appointing an impartial arbitrator, not the fairness of juries.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument because it discusses the behavior of expert witnesses, not the fairness of juries.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument because it discusses the cost of expert witnesses, not the fairness of juries.
  Therefore, none of the choices weakens the argument.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that jurors without specialized knowledge are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant, so trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that contradicts the argument.
  Option A supports the argument that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony given, which strengthens the argument.
  Option B states that the more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins. This contradicts the argument that jurors without specialized knowledge are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Therefore, option B weakens the argument.
  Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that the exclusion of people with specialized knowledge does not necessarily make the trial by jury unfair.
  Choice A supports the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony. So, it does not weaken the argument.
  Choice B also supports the argument by stating that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced. So, it does not weaken the argument.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument because it talks about appointing an impartial arbitrator, not a jury.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it talks about how experts give testimony, not about the fairness of trial by jury.
  Choice E weakens the argument by suggesting that expert witnesses may not be affordable for many people involved in litigation, making it difficult to have specialized knowledge on the jury.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument is that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries.

  Therefore, none of the options weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that jurors without specialized knowledge cannot comprehend the testimony and thus cannot be fair in settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  We need to find an answer that weakens this claim.
  Option A supports the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge cannot comprehend the testimony.
  Option B is irrelevant as it talks about the juror being prejudiced.
  Option C is also irrelevant as it talks about appointing an impartial arbitrator, not about jurors.
  Option D is also irrelevant as it talks about experts hedging their conclusions.
  Option E is also irrelevant as it talks about the cost of expert witnesses.
  Therefore, none of the options weakens the argument.
  The answer is "None of the Above."
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that juries are not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are excluded. 
  To weaken the argument, we need to provide evidence that juries can still be fair even without specialized knowledge.
  Choice A supports the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony. 
  Choice B also supports the argument by stating that jurors with specialized knowledge may be biased. 
  Choice C is irrelevant because it discusses a different means of settling disputes. 
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it discusses the behavior of expert witnesses, not jurors. 
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it discusses the cost of expert witnesses, not the fairness of juries. 
  Therefore, none of the choices weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that trial by jury can still be fair despite the exclusion of people with specialized knowledge.
  Choice A supports the argument by saying that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony.
  Choice B also supports the argument by saying that jurors with specialized knowledge may be biased.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it talks about appointing an arbitrator instead of a jury.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it talks about how experts give testimony, not about the fairness of trial by jury.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it talks about the cost of expert witnesses, not about the fairness of trial by jury.
  Therefore, none of the choices seriously weakens the argument.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument claims that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries, making the trial by jury unfair for disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that the exclusion of people with specialized knowledge does not necessarily make the trial unfair.
  Choice A supports the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony.
  Choice B also supports the argument by stating that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument, as it discusses appointing an impartial arbitrator, not a jury.
  Choice D is also irrelevant, as it discusses the behavior of expert witnesses, not jurors.
  Choice E is also irrelevant, as it discusses the cost of expert witnesses, not the fairness of a trial by jury.
  None of the choices weakens the argument, but choice A is the most relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
The argument claims that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries. To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that suggests trial by jury is still a fair means of settling such disputes.
Option A suggests that jurors without specialized knowledge may still comprehend the testimony, which weakens the argument.
Option B suggests that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced, which supports the argument.
Option C suggests that appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, which is irrelevant to the argument.
Option D suggests that experts may hedge their conclusions, which is irrelevant to the argument.
Option E suggests that expert witnesses may be too expensive, which is irrelevant to the argument.
Therefore, the best answer is A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  The opposing scientists argue that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  The geologist's argument is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  We need to find a statement that weakens the argument that biomarkers indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Choice C actually strengthens the geologist's argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it does not address the argument.

  We need to find the answer that weakens the geologist's argument.
  If biomarkers can exist without living organisms, then the geologist's argument is weakened.
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: 
  Choice A weakens the geologist's argument because it states that fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers. This means that biomarkers may not always be present in fossils, which weakens the argument that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum indicates the past or present existence of a living organism. The other choices are either irrelevant or do not directly weaken the geologist's argument.
Response 2:

Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.

Thought:
  The student argues that if many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, then they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms implies immunity to infection.
  The argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to answer choice C.
  Isabel's failure to take medication does not necessarily imply that she is still ill because the medication may not have cured her disease or alleviated its symptoms.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The student assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that a person has immunity to the microorganism.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because not all exposures to microorganisms lead to harmful symptoms, even in the absence of immunity.
  Choice A presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.
  It assumes that some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone based on the premise that some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because not all actions that best serve the interests of everyone are necessarily just.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, they have an immunity to the microorganism.
  However, the student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus is the only way to develop immunity to it.
  This flawed pattern of reasoning is most similar to option C, which assumes that medication is the only way to cure a disease.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This argument is flawed because it is possible that some people may be exposed to the microorganism and still develop harmful symptoms.
  Therefore, the pattern of reasoning in this argument is flawed.
  Answer choice A presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning by assuming that some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The student argues that if people are not affected by staphylococcus, then they have immunity to it.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because there are other possible explanations for why people are not affected by staphylococcus.
  The argument is similar to answer choice C because it assumes a cause-and-effect relationship without considering other possible explanations.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they must have immunity to that microorganism.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms means that the person has immunity to the microorganism.
  The argument is similar to (C) because it assumes that taking medication will either cure a disease or alleviate its symptoms, which is not always the case.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because the fact that someone is not affected by a microorganism does not necessarily mean that they have immunity to it.
  Therefore, we need to find an argument that has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Option C has a similar pattern of reasoning where the conclusion does not follow from the premise.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This argument assumes that the absence of symptoms implies immunity.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning is most similar to the pattern in which a conclusion is based on an assumption that is not necessarily true.
  The argument in choice C is similar in that it assumes that Isabel did not take the medication because she is still quite ill, but this may not be the case.
  The argument in choice E is similar in that it assumes that the procedure of washing hands cannot be of much value in preventing disease based on the fact that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals, but this may not be true.
  The argument in choice A is not similar in pattern of reasoning.
  The argument in choice B is not similar in pattern of reasoning.
  The argument in choice D is not similar in pattern of reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This is flawed reasoning because not everyone who is exposed to staphylococcus and does not develop symptoms has an immunity to it.
  The argument is similar in pattern to answer choice C, which concludes that Isabel did not take the medication because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  This is flawed reasoning because there are other reasons why Isabel might still be ill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The student assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means the person has an immunity to the microorganism.
  This assumption is flawed because some people may have a resistance to the microorganism but not a full immunity.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning is similar to option C where the speaker assumes that Isabel did not take the medication because she is still quite ill.
  This assumption is flawed because medication does not always cure disease or alleviate its symptoms.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The conflict is that the high-calorie diet required for the evolution of the human brain was most abundant in shore environments, but the evolution of the human brain took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find a statement that explains why the human brain evolved in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundant high-calorie diet in shore environments.
  Option A talks about metabolic rates, but it does not explain why the human brain evolved in savanna and woodland areas.
  Option B talks about the size of the earliest known humans' brains, but it does not explain why the human brain evolved in savanna and woodland areas.
  Option C suggests that prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today, which could explain why the human brain evolved in those areas despite the abundant high-calorie diet in shore environments.
  Option D talks about the techniques used to explore prehistoric shore sites, but it is not relevant to the conflict presented above.
  Option E suggests that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments, which could also explain why the human brain evolved in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundant high-calorie diet in shore environments.
  Option C and E both provide explanations for the apparent conflict presented above, but option E provides a more direct explanation that aligns with the fact that the high-calorie diet in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans. Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The conflict is that the high-calorie diet required for the evolution of the human brain was most abundant and reliable in shore environments, but the evolution of the human brain took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  We need to find a statement that would help explain why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas, despite the high-calorie diet being most abundant and reliable in shore environments.
  Option E suggests that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
  If this is true, then it would explain why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that a high-calorie diet was required for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The argument also states that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in shore environments.
  However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  Therefore, there is an apparent conflict between the argument's premises.
  To resolve the conflict, we need to find a statement that explains why the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas rather than in shore environments.
  Option E provides a reason why early humans might have preferred to gather food in savanna and woodland areas rather than in shore environments.
  Therefore, E is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage states that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was crucial for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The passage also states that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in shore environments.
  However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  There is an apparent conflict between the two statements.
  To resolve the conflict, we need to find a statement that explains why the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas despite the fact that food resources were most abundant and reliable in shore environments.
  Option E could explain that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments, which could be a reason why early humans did not evolve their brains in shore environments.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The apparent conflict presented is that the high-calorie diet needed for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain was most abundant and reliable in shore environments, but the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find an answer that explains why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundant and reliable food resources in shore environments.
  Option A is irrelevant to the conflict presented.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the conflict presented.
  Option C does not help to resolve the conflict presented.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the conflict presented.
  Option E, if true, would explain why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundant and reliable food resources in shore environments. If gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments, then it would make sense for early humans to evolve in savanna and woodland areas, where food was still abundant but required less energy to obtain.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that early humans required a high-calorie diet with adequate fats for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The shore environments had the most abundant and reliable food resources to support such a diet.
  However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  Therefore, there is a conflict between the requirement of a high-calorie diet and the fact that the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find an answer that explains how early humans could have obtained a high-calorie diet with adequate fats in savanna and woodland areas.
  Option E suggests that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
  Therefore, it is likely that early humans found other ways to obtain a high-calorie diet with adequate fats in savanna and woodland areas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage states that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The passage also states that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans.
  The passage further states that the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  There is an apparent conflict between the second and third statements.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find an option that explains why early humans did not evolve their brains in shore environments despite the availability of food resources.
  Option E suggests that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. This could explain why early humans did not evolve their brains in shore environments despite the availability of food resources.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage states that a high-calorie diet was necessary for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The passage also states that the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  However, the passage also states that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans.
  Therefore, the conflict is that the brain evolved in savanna and woodland areas despite the fact that shore environments had the resources necessary for the high-calorie diet.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find an answer that explains why the brain evolved in savanna and woodland areas instead of shore environments.
  Choice B provides information about the size of the earliest known human brains, but this doesn't help to resolve the conflict presented in the passage.
  Choice C provides information about the reliability of resources in prehistoric savanna and woodland areas, but this doesn't help to resolve the conflict presented in the passage.
  Choice D provides information about the techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites, but this doesn't help to resolve the conflict presented in the passage.
  Choice A and E could potentially help to resolve the conflict presented in the passage, but only choice E provides information that directly relates to the shore environments.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The apparent conflict is that the high-calorie diet that was required for the evolution of the human brain was most abundant in shore environments, yet the evolution of the human brain took place in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find an answer that explains why the human brain evolved in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundance of high-calorie diets in shore environments.
  Option A is irrelevant to the conflict.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the conflict.
  Option C does not explain why the human brain evolved in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundance of high-calorie diets in shore environments.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the conflict.
  Option E explains why the human brain evolved in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundance of high-calorie diets in shore environments because gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The passage also mentions that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans.
  However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  There seems to be a conflict between the two statements.
  To resolve the conflict, we need to find a statement that explains why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundance of food resources in shore environments.
  Option E suggests that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
  This statement explains why early humans preferred to live in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundance of food resources in shore environments.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

This could mean that workers with more control over their work have less exposure to the repetitive motion of typing, which could explain why they have a lower risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need to find an option that explains why the workers with the least control over their own work had a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option A is not helpful because it says that the workers with the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work, which does not explain why the workers with the least control over their own work had a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option B is plausible because it says that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  Option C is not helpful because it only talks about the keyboards on which office workers type, but it does not explain why the workers with the least control over their own work had a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option D is not helpful because it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards, which is not relevant to the study's findings.
  Option E is not helpful because it talks about office workers who perform repetitive motions other than typing, which is not relevant to the study's findings.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. 
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous, despite the fact that this drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy indicated above?
Choices:
  A: The drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available.
  B: The drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low.
  C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
  D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
  E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The researchers warn that the widespread use of the antidote could be dangerous.
  There are no serious side effects of the drug.
  The drug is currently effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  We need to find an option that reconciles the apparent discrepancy.
  Option A is irrelevant.
  Option B is not a good option to reconcile the discrepancy.
  Option C is also irrelevant.
  Option D is a good option to reconcile the discrepancy.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The antidote for chicken pox is effective and has no serious side effects.
  Researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  We need to find a statement that helps to reconcile the discrepancy.
  If the drug has some limitations or negative effects, it could explain why its widespread use could be dangerous.
  Option C states that the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
  This statement suggests that the drug may not be effective in controlling the spread of the disease, which could be a reason why its widespread use could be dangerous.
  Therefore, Option C helps to reconcile the apparent discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The antidote for chicken pox has no serious side effects and is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  Researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  The question asks for the option that reconciles the apparent discrepancy between the two statements.
  Option A is not related to the issue of the drug's safety and effectiveness.
  Option B is also not related to the issue of the drug's safety and effectiveness.
  Option C does not address the safety concern of the researchers.
  Option D suggests that the drug can be fatal when misused, which supports the researchers' concern about the drug's safety.
  Option E suggests that the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug, which also supports the researchers' concern about the drug's safety.
  Therefore, the answer is either D or E.
  Option E is more directly related to the issue of the drug's safety and effectiveness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The drug is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  Researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between the effectiveness of the drug and the warning from researchers.
  To reconcile the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the drug's effectiveness may not be enough to outweigh the potential dangers.
  Choice A is not relevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice B is related to patient compliance, but it doesn't explain why the drug's widespread use could be dangerous.
  Choice C is also related to the spread of the disease, but it doesn't explain why the drug's widespread use could be dangerous.
  Choice D provides a reason why the drug's widespread use could be dangerous, as it can be fatal if misused.
  Choice E also provides a reason why the drug's widespread use could be dangerous, as it contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
  Both choices D and E help to reconcile the apparent discrepancy, but choice E is a more direct explanation of why the drug's widespread use could be dangerous.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The antidote for chicken pox has no serious side effects and is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  However, the widespread use of this drug could be dangerous.
  We need to find a statement that helps to reconcile this apparent discrepancy.
  Option A and B do not address the issue of the potential danger of the drug.
  Option D suggests that the drug can be fatal when misused, which supports the idea that the drug could be dangerous.
  Option E suggests that the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug, which also supports the idea that the drug could be dangerous.
  Option C suggests that the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, which is not relevant to the apparent discrepancy.
  Therefore, the best answer is either D or E.
  However, option E is more extreme and less likely to be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The antidote for chicken pox is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.

  We need to find a statement that reconciles the apparent discrepancy between the effectiveness of the drug and the warning from the researchers.
  Option C states that the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another.
  This suggests that the widespread use of the drug could lead to more people contracting chicken pox, which could be dangerous.
  Therefore, option C helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The antidote for chicken pox has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  Researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  The apparent discrepancy could be reconciled if there is a reason why the drug should not be used despite its effectiveness.
  Option A and B provide reasons why the drug may not be widely used, but they do not explain why its widespread use could be dangerous.
  Option D and E provide reasons why the drug is dangerous, but they do not explain why it is effective despite being dangerous.
  Option C provides a reason why the drug is dangerous despite being effective, as it suggests that the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, which could lead to an outbreak of chicken pox in a population that is largely immune to the disease due to vaccination or prior infection.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The antidote for chicken pox is effective but its widespread use could be dangerous.
  The drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress.
  Intellectual discipline is also necessary to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  The conclusion is that the argument for freedom of thought fails.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse high-growing vegetation.
  It also states that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument must be related to the feeding habits of Diplodocus.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is not necessary since the argument already provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access vegetation.
  Choice E is the assumption required by the argument since it eliminates the possibility of Diplodocus browsing for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus could not have raised its neck to browse high-growing vegetation.
  Instead, it must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument must be something that supports the conclusion that Diplodocus could not have browsed for high-growing vegetation.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is a possibility, but it is not necessary for the argument.
  Choice E contradicts the argument, which suggests that Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation.
  Therefore, none of the choices is the correct assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The argument is based on the fact that computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the movement of raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Therefore, an assumption required by the argument would be something that strengthens the conclusion that Diplodocus fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is opposite to the argument's conclusion.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument because it suggests that Diplodocus could not browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, which strengthens the conclusion that Diplodocus fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument also states that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  Therefore, it must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.

Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the movement of raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument also states that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  The conclusion is that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument should be related to the conclusion.
  The argument does not mention anything about modern ground-feeding animals, blood supply, or other ways of accessing high-growing vegetation.
  The assumption required by the argument should be that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation except by raising its neck.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Diplodocus could not have raised its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation, but could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  The assumption required by the argument should be a statement that supports the claim that Diplodocus could not have raised its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not related to the argument.
  Choice D is opposite to the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  None of the choices is the assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  It also states that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land.

  An assumption required by the argument would be a statement that supports the conclusion.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not related to the argument.
  Choice D is opposite to what the argument states.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument because it challenges the possibility that Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
  Thus, the assumption required by the argument is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument states that Diplodocus's neck structure would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Instead, the neck could bend downward and extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  An assumption required by the argument is a statement that must be true for the conclusion to be valid.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not necessary for the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is not necessary for the argument.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument because if Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then it would not be necessary for Diplodocus to have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument must be related to the conclusion.
  The assumption must exclude the possibility that Diplodocus could have fed on high-growing vegetation in some other way.
  Choice D suggests that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  However, the argument does not exclude this possibility.
  Therefore, choice D is not the assumption required by the argument.
  The argument does not mention the type of neck structure found in modern ground-feeding animals, so choice A is irrelevant.
  The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision or brain, so choices B and C are also irrelevant.
  Choice E suggests that Diplodocus could have browsed for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
  However, the argument suggests that Diplodocus could only access underwater vegetation by bending its neck downward and extending it below ground level.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus could not browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
  The correct answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument then suggests that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and even extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  The assumption required by the argument should connect these two statements.
  Therefore, the assumption is that Diplodocus needed to access vegetation both on the ground and underwater to survive.
  Choice D suggests that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, but the argument does not mention this.
  Choice E suggests that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, but the argument suggests that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  Choice A, B, and C are irrelevant to the argument.

Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the official results of the national referendum must be rigged because everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal.
  The argument assumes that the speaker's personal experience is representative of the general population.
  The argument does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the official results are rigged.
  The argument does not consider the possibility that the speaker's social circle may not be representative of the general population.
  Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that since everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal, most people must have voted against it.
  This is a hasty generalization fallacy because the sample of people the speaker knows is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the official results of the national referendum must be rigged because everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal.
  The speaker's personal experience is not a representative sample of the general population.

  The answer is A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the official results of the national referendum are rigged because everyone the arguer knows voted against the proposal.
  This is a hasty generalization fallacy because the arguer is making a conclusion about the entire population based on a small sample of people they know.
  The argument is flawed because it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.

  The answer is A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the official results of the referendum must be rigged because everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal.
  The argument assumes that the people the speaker knows are a representative sample of the general population.
  The argument also assumes that people would be honest about how they voted.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed because it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument states that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal, but this is not a representative sample of the general population.
  The argument assumes that the speaker's personal experience is enough to disprove the official results of the national referendum.
  Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal, but this is not enough to conclude that most people voted against it.
  The argument is based on anecdotal evidence, which is not representative of the general population.
  Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument assumes that the people the speaker knows are representative of the general population, which is a hasty generalization.
  Just because the speaker knows people who voted against the proposal does not mean that most people voted against it.
  The official results of the national referendum indicate that 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed because it relies on a hasty generalization.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:

  The claim is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is C: It is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The psychologist's argument is about the importance of expressing gratitude and how it can only be fulfilled if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
  The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously supports the psychologist's argument by explaining the importance of knowing the source of the gratitude.
  Therefore, the claim is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The psychologist argues that expressing gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously because human psychology is driven primarily by personal interaction.
  The psychologist uses this claim to support the idea that the social function of positively reinforcing beneficial behaviors can only be served if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
  The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is not the conclusion of the argument, nor is it used to counter a consideration that might undermine the argument's conclusion.
  The claim is not the social benefit with which the argument is concerned.
  The claim is not used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
  Therefore, the most accurate description of the role played by the claim is that it is an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument's conclusion.
  The answer is A: It is an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument's conclusion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The psychologist argues that expressing gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously.
  The argument is that human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction.
  The psychologist claims that the important social function of positively reinforcing those behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can be served only if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
  The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is C: It is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The psychologist argues that expressing gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously.
  The reason for this is that human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction.
  The psychologist argues that the social function of positively reinforcing those behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can only be served if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
  The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Consumer magazine: Because front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers. So, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument in the consumer magazine?
Choices:
  A: All top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water.
  B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.
  C: A washing machine gets clothes really clean only with a laundry detergent specially formulated for that machine.
  D: A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
  E: Washers that use more water get clothes cleaner than those that use less.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option B is consistent with the principle stated above.
  Option C does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option D is consistent with the principle stated above.
  Option E does not provide enough information to determine whether the offer was legitimate or not.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The principle is used to justify a reasoning.
  To apply the principle, we need to determine whether the offer is legitimate or not.
  Then, we need to determine whether someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  If the offer is not legitimate, then there is no valid contract.
  If the offer is legitimate, then we need to determine whether there is a contract or not.
  The answer choice that best applies the principle is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The principle stated above says that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A is correct because it says that Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  Option B is incorrect because it says that Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  Option C is incorrect because it says that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. But the principle does not say that if an offer is legitimate, the other party must accept it.
  Option D is correct because it says that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  Option E is incorrect because it says that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. But the principle does not say that if an offer is not legitimate, there is no valid contract.
  Therefore, the answer is A or D.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A is correct because it states that Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  Option B is correct because it states that Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  Option C is incorrect because it states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. The principle does not apply here.
  Option D is correct because it states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  Option E is incorrect because it states that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. The principle does not apply here.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The argument that best justifies the principle is the one that presents a situation where the principle is applied.
  Option A talks about a legitimate offer that was not rejected, but it does not mention if the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option B mentions an offer made in jest, which invalidates the contract.
  Option C talks about a legitimate offer, but it does not mention if the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option D mentions an offer that was not made in jest, which validates the contract.
  Option E talks about an offer that was not legitimate, but it does not mention if the offer was made in jest or not.
  Therefore, the argument that best justifies the principle is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The argument that best justifies this principle would be one that involves a situation where an offer was not legitimate because it was made in jest.
  Option B presents a situation where an offer was made in jest, and therefore, the contract was not valid.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

Option B is correct because it states that Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
Option C is incorrect because it states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. This argument does not consider whether the offer was made in jest or not.
Option D is correct because it states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
Option E is incorrect because it states that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. This argument does not consider whether the offer was made in jest or not.
Therefore, the answer is either A, B, or D. Option A and B are correct, but option D provides more information.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.

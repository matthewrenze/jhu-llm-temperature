### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.

    B: This choice is not relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement.
    C: This choice is possible but not the most vulnerable to criticism.
    D: This choice is the most vulnerable to criticism because the advertisement does not consider other factors that may influence consumer preference for Sparkle Cola.
    E: This choice is not relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement.
  Therefore, the answer is D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The study was conducted on blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas.
  The advertisement assumes that the preference of the volunteers for Sparkle Cola will translate into buying Sparkle Cola.
  The advertisement does not consider other factors that may influence the preference of consumers for Sparkle Cola.
  The reasoning in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism on multiple grounds.
  Option A criticizes the generalization of the study results to each smaller group, but the study was designed to have each group taste a different cola.
  Option B is a valid criticism of the advertisement, but it is not the most vulnerable point.
  Option C is a possible criticism, but it is not the most vulnerable point.
  Option D is a valid criticism of the advertisement, and it is more vulnerable than option B and C.
  Option E is not a valid criticism of the advertisement since the study was designed to compare the preference for different colas.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that most volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The study was carefully controlled and blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups.
  The criticism that the advertisement is most vulnerable to is that it overlooks other possibilities that could have affected the results of the study.
  Choice A suggests that the study's generalization may not be true for each of the five smaller groups.
  Choice B suggests that the study takes for granted that most volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola over other colas.
  Choice C suggests that the study overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  Choice D suggests that the study overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons other than taste.
  Choice E suggests that the study does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
  The criticism that is most relevant to the reasoning in the advertisement is the one that suggests that the study may have overlooked other factors that could have affected the results.
  Choice D is the best answer because it suggests that people's preference for Sparkle Cola may be influenced by factors other than taste, such as packaging or price.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that most volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the other colas tasted in the study.
  However, the study only tested five colas and did not include all possible colas in the market.
  Therefore, it is possible that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  The reasoning is vulnerable to criticism on this ground.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing colas tasted.
  However, the advertisement does not consider the possibility that the preference of the volunteers might not be true for each of the five smaller groups.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than any of the competing colas tested.
  However, the study only tested five competing colas.
  It is possible that there are other colas not tested in the study that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  The answer is C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The study was conducted on blindfolded volunteers divided into five groups.
  The advertisement takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted.
  The reasoning is most vulnerable to criticism on grounds that it overlooks other factors such as packaging or price that may influence consumer preference.
  Therefore, the answer is D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The study was conducted on blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas.
  The advertisement assumes that the preference of the volunteers is representative of the general population.
  The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks other factors that could have influenced the preference of the volunteers.
  Choice D presents a possible factor that could have influenced the preference of the volunteers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The study was conducted on blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas.
  Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The advertisement concluded that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
    - Option A is not relevant because the study already divided the volunteers into five groups.
    - Option B is not relevant because the advertisement only claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted, not that they would buy it over other colas in different situations.
    - Option C is a valid criticism because the study only tested five competing colas, and there could be other colas that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
    - Option D is a valid criticism because the study did not control for factors such as packaging or price, which could influence the volunteers' preference for Sparkle Cola.
    - Option E is not relevant because the study was only concerned with comparing Sparkle Cola to other colas.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or D. However, option C is a more direct criticism of the study's methodology, so the answer is C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The study was conducted on blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of the five competing colas.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument above concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  This conclusion is based on the premise that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent, which is when the consequent of a conditional statement is negated, and the antecedent is inferred to be negated as well.
  The argument can be restated as: If a bird feeder does not have a protective cover, then squirrels will eat from it. Therefore, if a bird feeder has a protective cover, then it will attract many birds.
  Choice A is not similar to the argument above.
  Choice B is similar to the argument above because it commits the same fallacy of denying the antecedent.
  Choice C is not similar to the argument above.
  Choice D is similar to the argument above because it commits the same fallacy of denying the antecedent.
  Choice E is not similar to the argument above.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or D. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement that if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, squirrels will eat from it and it will not attract many birds.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The conclusion is based on the assumption that all bird feeders without protective covers will be eaten by squirrels.
  The pattern of reasoning is similar to the argument in choice D, which concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, based on the assumption that all tires with low pressure are caused by the car owner's neglect.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement using "if...then" format.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The argument assumes that the only reason squirrels eat from a bird feeder is that it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument ignores other possible reasons why a bird feeder may not attract many birds.
  The answer should present a similar flawed pattern of reasoning that presents a conditional statement and ignores other possible reasons.
  Choice D presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning. It concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, ignoring other possible reasons.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds.
  The premise is that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is that squirrels eat from it.
  This is flawed because there could be other reasons why a bird feeder does not attract many birds.
  Choice A is not similar to the argument above.
  Choice B is similar to the argument above because it assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is that the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  Choice C is not similar to the argument above.
  Choice D is similar to the argument above because it assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is that the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  Choice E is not similar to the argument above.
  The best answer is either B or D.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover based on the premise that squirrels only eat from a bird feeder if it lacks a protective cover.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning is that the conclusion is based on a single cause and effect relationship.
  Choice (A) has a similar pattern of reasoning where the conclusion is based on a single cause and effect relationship.
  Therefore, the answer is A: If a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely because the conclusion is based on a single cause and effect relationship. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds.
  The premise is that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument assumes that the only reason a bird feeder does not have a protective cover is that squirrels have eaten from it.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning is that the argument assumes that there is no other reason why a bird feeder would lack a protective cover.
  Choice D has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning, assuming that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument above concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The argument supports this conclusion by stating that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument assumes that squirrels are the only animals that eat from bird feeders.
  The argument also assumes that the presence of squirrels is the only reason that a bird feeder would not attract many birds.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in answer choice D.
  Answer choice D concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  Answer choice D supports this conclusion by stating that tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  Answer choice D assumes that neglecting to check the pressure regularly is the only reason that a tire would wear out prematurely.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is based on a conditional statement.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the only factor affecting the number of birds attracted to a bird feeder is the presence of a protective cover.
  The argument is similar to answer choice B because it also assumes that the only factor affecting tire wear is tire pressure neglect.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover based on the premise that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder would not attract many birds is because of squirrels eating from it, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice D is most similar in flawed reasoning because it assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument above is a conditional statement.
  The conclusion of the argument is that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The flaw in the argument is that it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder does not attract many birds is because of squirrels.
  The argument does not consider other reasons that may prevent birds from being attracted to a bird feeder.
  The argument is similar to answer choice E because it assumes that the only reason a tire wears out prematurely is because of low tire pressure.
  Answer choice E assumes that low tire pressure is the only factor that causes a tire to wear out prematurely.
  Both arguments ignore other factors that may contribute to the issue.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The argument supports this by stating that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this reasoning.
  Option A doesn't weaken the argument as it states that many people overestimate the dangers regardless of television.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C strengthens the argument as it states that people who watch less television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood of natural disasters.
  Option D weakens the argument as it states that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  It also claims that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
  We need to find an option that weakens the argument.
  Option A does not weaken the argument but rather supports it.
  Option B does not have any relation to the argument.
  Option C does not weaken the argument but rather supports it.
  Option D weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  Option E does not have any relation to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the relationship between television watching and overestimating risks is not as straightforward as the argument claims.
  Answer choice A does not address the relationship between television watching and overestimating risks.
  Answer choice B suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters. This does not weaken the argument.
  Answer choice C suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of a natural disaster. This supports the argument.
  Answer choice D suggests that people who are well informed about the risks of natural disasters tend to get their information from sources other than television. This weakens the argument.
  Answer choice E suggests that people who live in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch an above-average amount of television. This does not weaken the argument.
  The best answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  It supports this claim by stating that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this claim or provides an alternate explanation.
  Choice A does not weaken the argument as it does not address the relationship between television viewing and overestimation of risks.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument as it suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters, which does not address the relationship between television viewing and overestimation of risks.
  Choice C weakens the argument as it suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster, which contradicts the claim made in the argument.
  Choice D weakens the argument as it suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, which implies that television viewing is not the only factor that leads to overestimation of risks.
  Choice E does not weaken the argument as it suggests that people who live in an area that is prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch an above-average amount of television, which does not address the relationship between television viewing and overestimation of risks.
  
  Therefore, the answer is C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
Response 4:

  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find a statement that weakens this claim.
  If people who watch a below-average amount of television also overestimate the risks of natural disasters, then the argument is weakened.
  Choice A weakens the argument by stating that many people overestimate the risks of natural disasters regardless of the amount of television they watch.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think they will be victims of a natural disaster than those who do not watch an above-average amount of television.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this.
  Option A does not address the relationship between television watching and perception of natural disasters.
  Option B contradicts the argument, but it is not clear how the two are related.
  Option C strengthens the argument, so it cannot be the answer.
  Option D is irrelevant because it does not address the relationship between television watching and perception of natural disasters.
  Option E does not address the relationship between television watching and perception of natural disasters.
  Therefore, the best answer is B because it contradicts the argument by saying that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area prone to natural disasters. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that watching too much television leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find an answer that weakens this claim.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B suggests that people who watch more television are less likely to live in an area prone to natural disasters, which weakens the argument.
  Option C suggests that people who watch less television have a better idea of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster, which supports the argument.
  Option D suggests that people who are well-informed about natural disasters do not get their information from television, which weakens the argument.
  Option E suggests that people who live in areas prone to natural disasters watch more television, which supports the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risk of natural disasters.
  We need to find a statement that weakens this claim.
  If there is evidence that people who do not watch television also overestimate the risk of natural disasters, then the argument is weakened.
  Choice A suggests that many people overestimate the dangers regardless of the amount of television they watch, so it weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an answer that shows that watching television is not the cause of the overestimation of risks.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B suggests that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, which does not have any impact on the argument.
  Option C suggests that people who watch less television tend to have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of natural disasters, which supports the argument.
  Option D suggests that people who are well-informed about the risks of natural disasters tend to become well-informed by some other means than watching television, which weakens the argument.
  Option E suggests that people living in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch more television, which supports the argument.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics
Response 0:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the study's results should not be doubted because the author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  However, the biologist does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the conclusion that the study's results are reliable.
  The argument also does not address the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument fails to provide evidence or reasoning to support the conclusion that the study's results are reliable.
  The answer is E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The biologist claims that the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  However, this does not necessarily justify the conclusions of the study.
  The argument does not address the criticism that the sample size was too small.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument is not addressing the specific concerns of the critics.
  The argument is not addressing the small sample size of the study or the generalizability of the results to lizards as a whole.
  Therefore, the answer is A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that the study's results are valid despite the small sample size because the author is a well-regarded professional who has been doing excellent work for years.
  This argument is vulnerable to criticism because the validity of a study's results should be based on the study's methodology and not the reputation of the author.
  Therefore, the answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conclusion that is based on two premises:
  1. The study concludes that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  2. The study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  The argument fails to consider other factors that could affect the study's conclusion.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to demonstrate that the study's conclusion is based on reliable evidence.
  Choice A is incorrect because the argument does not make any generalization about lizards as a whole.
  Choice B is incorrect because the argument does not need to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
  Choice C is incorrect because the argument does not focus its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  Choice D is incorrect because the argument does not need to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise.
  Choice E is incorrect because the argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.

Response 5:
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument suggests that the study's results are valid because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  However, the argument does not address the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  The argument also assumes that the behavior of six individual chameleons is generalizable to lizards as a whole, which may not be true.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The biologist concludes that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D based on a careful study of six individual chameleons.
  The biologist argues that critics of the study are wrong to doubt its results because the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  The biologist's argument is vulnerable to criticism because it relies on the authority of the study's author and does not address the substance of the critics' objections.
  Therefore, the answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that the dramatic increase in the subscription rate for scholarly journals implies that publishing a scholarly journal is much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests the increase in subscription rates does not necessarily mean that publishing a scholarly journal is more profitable now.
  Answer choice C provides such an explanation by suggesting that publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates indicates a higher profit for publishers.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that contradicts the premise.
  Option C states that publishing a scholarly journal is expensive, and publishers cannot survive if they consistently lose money. This option contradicts the premise of the argument.
  Therefore, option C most seriously weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that the cost of publishing a scholarly journal has remained constant, but the subscription rates have increased.
  The argument concludes that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that contradicts the conclusion.
  Option A is irrelevant as it talks about passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  Option B is also irrelevant as it talks about the library's acquisition budget being a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  Option C actually supports the argument.
  Option D contradicts the conclusion as it states that the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged.
  Option E is irrelevant as it talks about the frequency of publishing scholarly journals.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates is due to the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that the profitability of publishing scholarly journals is not the reason for the increase in subscription rates.
  Option A talks about libraries passing on the costs to users, but it does not address the profitability of publishing journals.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C supports the argument that publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise.
  Option D weakens the argument by stating that the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years, indicating that the increase in subscription rates is not due to profitability.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument is that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained constant, but subscription rates have increased.
  The conclusion is that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer that shows that publishing a scholarly journal is not more profitable now.
  Choice A is unrelated to the argument.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C strengthens the argument.
  Choice D is a possible answer. If most subscribers are individuals, then the increase in subscription rates for libraries does not necessarily mean that publishing a scholarly journal is more profitable. 
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is that the subscription rates of scholarly journals have increased dramatically, while the cost of publishing them has remained constant, indicating that publishing journals must be more profitable now than it was before.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that shows that the profitability of publishing journals has not increased.
  Choice C states that publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money. This statement suggests that publishers may not be making more profit, even if the subscription rates have increased.
  Therefore, C is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates indicates that publishing a scholarly journal must be more profitable now than it was before.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that shows that the subscription rate increase is not due to increased profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
  Answer choice C provides a reason why publishers would not consistently increase subscription rates if they want to survive financially.
  Therefore, answer choice C most seriously weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The argument states that because the subscription rate has increased while the costs of publishing have remained constant, publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago. To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that shows that the conclusion is not necessarily true. 
Option A talks about the increase in fines for overdue books and periodicals, which is irrelevant to the argument. Option B is also irrelevant to the argument. Option C supports the argument. Option D weakens the argument by stating that subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. Option E does not relate to the argument. 
Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that the cost of publishing a scholarly journal has remained fairly constant, but the subscription rate has increased dramatically. 
  The argument concludes that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that suggests that publishing scholarly journals is not more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  Option C states that publishing a scholarly journal is expensive, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money. This suggests that the increased subscription rate may be necessary for publishers to survive financially, and not necessarily because it is more profitable than before.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that the cost of publishing a scholarly journal has remained constant, yet the subscription rates have increased.
  The argument concludes that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that contradicts the conclusion or breaks the link between the premises and the conclusion.
  Option A discusses the increase in fines for overdue books and periodicals, which is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B provides information about the operating budget of the university library, which is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C supports the argument by stating that publishing a scholarly journal is expensive and publishers cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  Option D weakens the argument by stating that subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. If most subscribers are individuals, then the increase in subscription rates for libraries may not necessarily mean publishing a scholarly journal is more profitable now.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors resulted in a decrease in patient injuries which indicates that the plan was effective. To strengthen the argument, we need to find the option that provides additional evidence or explanation for the decrease in patient injuries.
A: This option provides information about the policy before the plan was implemented, but it does not explain the decrease in patient injuries after the plan was implemented. It is irrelevant to the argument.
B: This option provides evidence that the incidence of patient injuries decreased at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan. It weakens the argument by suggesting that factors other than the plan could have caused the decrease in patient injuries.
C: This option weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries. This implies that the decrease in patient injuries could have resulted from the unrecorded staff errors that were not captured by the plan.
D: This option strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was a result of the staff's awareness of the close analysis of their records. This implies that the staff's attention to detail increased because they knew their errors were being closely monitored.
E: This option is irrelevant to the argument as it does not provide any information about the effectiveness of the plan in reducing patient injuries.
Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the systematic recording of staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries.
  We need to find an option that strengthens this claim.
  Option A is irrelevant.
  Option B is not related to the hospitals that implemented the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it indicates that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option D strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in injuries was a result of staff becoming more meticulous.
  Option E is irrelevant.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of recording staff errors led to a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries was indeed due to the implementation of the plan.
  Choice B is irrelevant as it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Choice C weakens the argument as it suggests that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  Choice E is also irrelevant as it talks about the consequences of staff errors, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choices A and D are both plausible in strengthening the argument.
  However, choice D is more relevant as it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was indeed due to the implementation of the plan.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
The argument is that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors reduced patient injuries. 
To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries is indeed due to the implementation of the plan. 
Option B is irrelevant since it talks about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan. 
Option C is also irrelevant since it talks about errors that did not result in patient injuries. 
Option E is also irrelevant since it talks about the consequences of making errors. 
Option A is also irrelevant since it talks about a policy that was already in place before the implementation of the plan. 
Option D strengthens the argument by stating that the decrease in injuries occurred only after the staff became aware that their errors were being monitored. 
Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has decreased substantially at hospitals since the implementation of the plan to record all staff errors.
  The argument suggests that this is due to the knowledge that errors were being carefully monitored, which made the staff more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  We need to strengthen this argument.
  Option B discusses a hospital that did not participate in the plan, so it is not relevant to the argument.
  Option C suggests that the plan was not comprehensive, so it weakens the argument.
  Option E discusses the consequences of the errors, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Option A suggests that the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient. This implies that the hospitals were already careful and thorough in their approach to patient care. Therefore, the decrease in patient injuries cannot be attributed to this policy. Hence, it weakens the argument.
  Option D suggests that the decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. This option strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was directly related to the staff's knowledge that their errors were being monitored.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors has substantially decreased the incidence of injuries. 
The correct answer will provide evidence that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the plan, not something else.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B may suggest an alternative explanation for the decrease in patient injuries, weakening the argument.
Option C suggests that the plan did not record all staff errors, which could weaken the argument.
Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
Option D suggests that the decrease in injuries was related to the staff's awareness of the records, reinforcing the argument.
Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to systematically record all staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the reduction was due to the implementation of the plan.
  Option B is irrelevant, as it talks about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument as it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option E is also irrelevant as it talks about the consequences of staff errors rather than the implementation of the plan.
  Option A may weaken the argument as it suggests that the hospitals were already careful in investigating staff errors.
  Option D supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in injuries was due to the staff becoming aware of the monitoring.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased due to the implementation of the plan to systematically record all staff errors. The argument concludes that the knowledge of careful monitoring made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous. To strengthen the argument, we need to show a causal relationship between the implementation of the plan and the decrease in patient injuries.
A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about a different policy that was already in place.
B: This statement weakens the argument as it shows that the decrease in patient injuries is not necessarily due to the implementation of the plan.
C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about errors that were not recorded.
D: This statement strengthens the argument as it shows that the decrease in patient injuries began only when the staff became aware of the records being analyzed.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.
The most appropriate answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors resulted in a substantial decrease in patient injuries.
  The argument suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff being more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties because they knew their errors were being monitored.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer that supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument because it refers to a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Choice C is not relevant because it refers to errors that did not result in patient injuries.
  Choice E is also not relevant because it refers to the consequences of staff errors, not the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.
  Choice A may weaken the argument because it suggests that the hospitals already had a policy of investigating life-threatening staff errors before the implementation of the plan.
  Choice D supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries did not begin until the staff became aware that their errors were being monitored. This implies that the staff's increased diligence is due to the implementation of the plan.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether
Choices:
  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile
  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile
  D: there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered
  E: the average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is about whether to impose a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river.
  The argument states that the penalty is so severe that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
  Choice A states that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing the penalty.
  This principle supports the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument is about the justification for imposing a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river.
  The argument states that the penalty is severe, and there is not enough evidence to justify imposing it.
  The reasoning behind the argument is that one must be sufficiently certain of the guilt of a party before imposing a severe penalty.
  Therefore, the principle that best justifies the argument is that the more severe the penalty is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  The answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument is about the justification of imposing a penalty for polluting the river.
  The argument claims that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also claims that without stronger evidence or admission of responsibility, the identity of the polluter cannot be certain enough to justify imposing the penalty.
  Therefore, the principle that most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument is the one that states that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  The answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is about the justification for imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence.
  The argument suggests that the penalty is too severe to be imposed without stronger evidence or an admission of guilt.
  Option A states that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing the penalty.
  This principle aligns with the reasoning in the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument is discussing the severity of the penalty for pollution.
  The argument is saying that the penalty is so severe that stronger evidence is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
  Answer choice A states that the more severe the penalty is, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing the penalty.
  This aligns with the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, answer choice A is the best answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is discussing the justification for imposing a severe penalty.
  The argument suggests that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, the penalty cannot be imposed.
  The justification for this is that the penalty is so severe that a high degree of certainty is required.
  Choice A most closely matches this reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also suggests that stronger evidence is needed or the perpetrator admits responsibility to justify imposing the penalty.
  The reasoning in the argument depends on the principle that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the certainty of guilt.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  The argument is based on the principle that the severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument discusses the severity of the penalty for committing an infraction.
  The argument suggests that the penalty cannot be imposed unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility.
  The reasoning is based on the principle that the severity of the penalty for an infraction should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is talking about the difficulty of imposing a penalty for an infraction when the evidence is not strong enough to be certain of the identity of the polluter.
  The argument implies that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  Therefore, the principle that best justifies the reasoning in the argument is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The legislator's proposal is to spend the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The justification for the columnist's judgment should be a principle that the proposal violates.
  Option B seems to be a valid principle that supports the columnist's judgment.
  The money approved to collect on water bills was for building a dam, which will benefit the entire community, and not just some members.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The columnist is arguing that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The legislator's proposal is to spend the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist thinks that the money collected from the additional charge on water bills should be used to build the dam.
  The principle that would most help to justify the columnist's judgment is that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  The reason is that building a dam benefits the entire community by providing a source of water, while building new roads benefits only some members of the community.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The legislator's proposal is to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The principle that justifies the columnist's judgment should be related to the legislator's proposal.
  Principle B states that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community. This principle supports the columnist's position that building new roads does not benefit the entire community in the same way that building a dam would.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The legislator's proposal is to use the additional revenue from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.

  The columnist's judgment is based on a principle that justifies why the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  Option B is the most relevant principle that justifies the columnist's judgment.
  If the money is designated for projects that benefit an entire community, it should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The legislator's proposal was to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist believes that the extra money from water bills should be used to build a dam.
  The principle that most justifies the columnist's judgment would be one that supports the idea that the extra money from water bills should be used to build a dam and not for other purposes.
  Choice B is the most relevant principle that supports the columnist's judgment.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads, instead of building a dam, is unacceptable.
  The proposal suggests using money that is designated for a specific project to fund a different project.
  Therefore, the principle that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community would most help to justify the columnist's judgment.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The legislator's proposal is to spend the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist believes that building the dam is a better use of the money.
  The principle that most helps to justify the columnist's judgment should support the idea that building the dam is a better use of the money.
  Choice B is the most relevant principle as it states that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that the legislator's proposal to use the additional revenue from water bills to build new roads, instead of building a dam, is unacceptable.
  The principle that can help to justify the columnist's judgment is that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  The construction of a dam is a project that benefits the entire community, while the construction of new roads benefits only some members of the community.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Response 0:

  The argument in the advertisement claims that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is based on a recent survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if the survey is biased or if the argument overlooks important factors.
  Choice A suggests that the survey may be biased.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C suggests that switching to another insurance company may be a better option.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E suggests that the sample may not be representative of the population.
  Choice A is the best answer because it suggests that the survey may be biased.
Action: Answer("A")

  The argument in the advertisement is based on a survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  The survey reported that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if it overlooks some important possibilities or takes for granted some assumptions that may not be true.
  Choice A criticizes the argument for overlooking the possibility that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  This criticism is relevant and may weaken the argument, as it suggests that the average savings reported in the survey may not be representative of the savings of all new policyholders.
  Therefore, the answer is A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.

  The advertisement argues that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is based on a survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders who reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  One of the choices will criticize the argument's vulnerability.
  Choice A is not a valid criticism of the argument because the survey only reports the average savings and not the savings of every new policyholder.
  Choice B is not a valid criticism of the argument because the argument does not compare the average cost of new policyholders with the average cost of long-term policyholders.
  Choice C is a valid criticism of the argument because the argument does not address the possibility that other insurance companies offer even more savings than Popelka.
  Choice D is not a valid criticism of the argument because the survey is based on the policyholders' self-reports and not on the actual savings.
  Choice E is not a valid criticism of the argument because the argument is based on the survey of all new policyholders, not a specific group of people.
  Therefore, the answer is C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:

  The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
  
  A: If some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the advertisement's claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  
  B: The advertisement does not make any assumption about the cost of auto insurance for new and old policyholders, so this choice is not correct.
  
  C: The advertisement does not address the possibility of other insurance companies offering even more savings than Popelka, so this choice is not correct.
  
  D: The advertisement does not make any assumption about the accuracy of the savings reported by the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders, so this choice is not correct.
  
  E: If the people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders, then the advertisement's claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  
  Therefore, the argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds mentioned in choice A.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.
Response 0:
Thought:
The second group of doctors argue that bilirubin levels in newborn babies should be allowed to remain high since the brain's natural defenses prevent bilirubin from entering.
We need to find a choice that supports this argument.
Option B states that some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
This supports the argument of the second group of doctors.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
Response 0:
Thought:
The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the comparison between Group A and Group B.
The evidence provided is that Group A had only one lapse while Group B had fourteen lapses.
We need to select the option that is least helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn.
Option A: This is helpful because it ensures that the number of people in each group is the same, which makes the comparison fair.
Option B: This is helpful because it ensures that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which eliminates the possibility of bias.
Option C: This is helpful because it ensures that the college students were all young, which eliminates the possibility that age was a factor in their performance.
Option D: This is helpful because it ensures that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones, which eliminates the possibility that one group had an advantage over the other.
Option E: This is helpful because it ensures that both groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which eliminates the possibility that one group had more time to prepare than the other.
Action: Answer("C")

  The evidence for this conclusion is that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B (composed of college students).
  We need to find the option that is LEAST helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Option A is helpful because it ensures that the number of people in each group is the same.
  Option B is helpful because it ensures that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  Option C is helpful because it ensures that there were no persons more than forty years old among the college students.
  Option D is helpful because it ensures that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  Option E is helpful because it ensures that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
  Therefore, the LEAST helpful option is the one that does not add value to the conclusion.
  Option C is not related to the conclusion. It talks about the age of the college students, but it does not add any value to the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages because Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) had only one lapse in memory while Group B (composed of college students) had fourteen lapses in memory.
  We need to find the statement that does not support the conclusion above.
  Answer choice A is helpful because it tells us that the number of people in each group is equal and that the result is not due to a difference in sample size.
  Answer choice B is helpful because it tells us that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups and that the result is not due to a difference in the response of the researchers.
  Answer choice C is helpful because it tells us that there were no persons more than forty years old among the college students, which means that the result is not due to the inclusion of older people in Group B.
  Answer choice D is helpful because it tells us that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which means that the result is not due to a difference in the availability of telephones.
  Answer choice E is helpful because it tells us that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which means that the result is not due to a difference in the timing of instructions.
  Therefore, the least helpful statement is the one that does not support the conclusion above.
  The statement that least supports the conclusion is C because it does not provide any information that could help us understand why Group A performed better than Group B. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:

  Choice A is helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Choice B is helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Choice C is helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Choice D is helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Choice E is not helpful in establishing the conclusion because it does not address the differences between the two groups.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

  We need to find the option that does not help to establish the conclusion.
  Option A, D, and E provide information that is relevant to the study.
  Option C is not helpful because it only mentions that there were no persons more than forty years old among the college students. This does not provide any evidence that supports or challenges the conclusion.
  Option B is not helpful because it only mentions that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups. This does not provide any evidence that supports or challenges the conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.

  We need to find the option that is least helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Option A, D, and E seem relevant to the conclusion.
  Option B seems helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Option C is talking about the age of college students, but it is not relevant to the conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, and this is based on the fact that Group A had only one lapse while Group B had fourteen lapses.
The question asks for the option that is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
Option A is helpful since it establishes that the groups were of the same size.
Option B is helpful since it establishes that there was no bias in answering the calls.
Option C is helpful since it establishes that the college students were younger than the elderly people in Group A.
Option D is helpful since it establishes that both groups had the same resources to make the calls.
Option E is the LEAST helpful since it does not relate to the conclusion that memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Therefore, the answer is E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages based on the results of the study.
  To support this conclusion, it is important to establish that the study was conducted fairly and that the results were not due to any extraneous factors.
  Option B, which states that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, is the least helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it does not relate to the memory of the participants.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Resident: Data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in our town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe. Hence, at least 60 percent of our town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Question: The reasoning in the resident's argument is flawed in that the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the town has a relatively small number of houses
  B: inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe
  C: structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage
  D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe
  E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage
Response 0:
Thought:
  The resident's argument concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The argument is based on the fact that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The argument assumes that there is no overlap between the two groups.
  Choice D points out that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe, which means that the argument may be flawed because it assumes that all houses in the town have one or both of these problems.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the houses in the town have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The conclusion is based on the premise that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  However, the argument overlooks the possibility that some of the houses might have both inadequate site drainage and structural defects.
  Answer choice E addresses this possibility and is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The resident's argument claims that 60% of the town's houses are threatened.
  The evidence given is that 30% have inadequate drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  However, it could be possible that some houses have both problems.
  Therefore, the argument overlooks the possibility that some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
  The answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The resident's argument concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The argument is based on two premises:
    1. 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage.
    2. 30% of the houses in the town have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The resident's argument concludes that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The argument is based on the premise that 30 percent of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe.

  Therefore, the correct answer is E: some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The resident states that 30% of houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the houses have some kind of problem.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that some houses may have neither of these problems.
  Therefore, the answer is D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The resident's argument is that at least 60% of the houses in the town have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The argument is based on two premises: 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The argument assumes that these two premises are independent of each other, and that there is no overlap between them.
  However, it is possible that some houses have both inadequate site drainage and structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  Therefore, the argument overlooks the possibility that some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
  The answer is E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The resident claims that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  If many of the houses do not have either inadequate site drainage or structural defects, then the conclusion that at least 60% of the houses have some kind of problem is flawed.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The resident argues that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The resident supports their argument by stating that 30 percent of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The resident's argument assumes that there is no overlap between the houses with inadequate site drainage and the houses with structural defects.
  The answer choice that points out this flaw is E. If some of the houses with structural defects also have inadequate site drainage, then the actual percentage of houses with problems may be less than 60 percent.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The resident's argument states that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The resident then concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  Therefore, the answer is D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument is that we should reject Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
The conclusion of the argument is that we are justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
For the conclusion to be properly drawn, it must be assumed that our justification for praising or blaming someone for an action is based on how much we know about the events that led to that action.
Option A is not relevant to the conclusion of the argument.
Option B is not relevant to the conclusion of the argument.
Option C is restating the conclusion of the argument.
Option D is not relevant to the conclusion of the argument.
Option E is not relevant to the conclusion of the argument.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
The argument of the ethicist is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The question is asking for an assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn. 
Option A seems to be an assumption that is not required to support the conclusion of the argument. 
Option B is also not directly related to the argument. 
Option C seems to be restating the conclusion of the argument, rather than an assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn.
Option D seems to be a valid assumption since it suggests that the amount of information available affects our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action. 
Option E is not related to the argument since it suggests that the amount of information available affects whether we regard an action as freely performed, rather than whether we can praise or blame someone for that action. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
The argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. 
The conclusion is that Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about the events leading up to any action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed is rash. 
To enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn, we need an assumption that links the premise to the conclusion.
Option A is too extreme and goes beyond the scope of the argument.
Option B is a restatement of the premise and does not add any new information.
Option C is a restatement of the premise and does not add any new information.
Option D is a possible assumption that links the premise to the conclusion.
Option E is opposite to what the premise is saying.  
Therefore, the correct answer is D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that we must reject Tolstoy's claim.
  The conclusion is based on the premise that praising or blaming a person for an action requires knowledge of the events leading up to the action.
  The correct answer will show an assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  Answer choices A, B, C, and D do not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  Choice E is not relevant to the conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
The argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. 
The conclusion is that Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about the events leading up to any action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed is wrong.
To draw this conclusion, we need to assume that there are cases where we can justifiably praise or blame a person for an action.
Option A is too extreme and goes beyond what the argument is saying.
Option B is not relevant to the conclusion of the argument.
Option C restates the argument's premise, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
Option D is close to what we need. It acknowledges that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree and that our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. This implies that there are cases where we can justifiably praise or blame a person for an action even if we do not know everything about the events leading up to that action.
Option E is the opposite of what the argument is saying. The argument is saying that we need to know a lot about the events leading up to an action to be able to praise or blame a person for that action.
Therefore, the best answer is D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
Response 5:
Thought:
The argument of the ethicist is that we are only justified in praising or blaming a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action. 
The conclusion of the argument is that Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about the events leading up to any action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed is wrong.
To enable this conclusion to be properly drawn, we need to find an assumption that connects the premise of the argument with its conclusion.
Option A is not the correct answer as it contradicts the premise of the argument.
Option B does not provide any connection between the premise and the conclusion of the argument.
Option C is a restatement of the premise of the argument and does not connect it to the conclusion.
Option D is not the correct answer as it contradicts the premise of the argument.
Option E is also not the correct answer as it is not related to the premise or the conclusion of the argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:

  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The argument rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about any action, we would cease to regard it as freely performed.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn must support the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice C supports this idea by stating that we can only be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is that we should reject Tolstoy's claim that knowing more about the events leading up to an action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The argument suggests that we can still be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action even if we know a lot about the events that led to it.
  The assumption that would enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn should support the idea that knowing more about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily undermine our ability to praise or blame a person for that action.
  Choice C seems to be the most relevant assumption because it supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard it as freely performed, regardless of how much information we have about the events leading up to it.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
The argument of the ethicist is that we can only praise or blame someone for their actions if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. Therefore, we must assume something that supports this argument. 
Option A is not relevant to the argument of the ethicist. 
Option C is a restatement of the argument of the ethicist, but it does not enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn. 
Option D is also not relevant to the argument of the ethicist. 
Option E is the opposite of what the argument is saying. 
Option B supports the argument of the ethicist by stating that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
The argument states that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events leading up to it. 
The assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn is one that supports the statement above.
Option A is not related to the argument.
Option B talks about the determination of responsibility and not about the justification of praising or blaming a person for an action.
Option C is restating the argument and not making any assumption.
Option D is talking about the variation of inclination to blame or praise, but not about the justification of it.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.

  Option E is irrelevant to the assertion.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The economists suggest that trading urban-produced goods or services for agricultural products can solve urbanization problems.
  To support this assertion, we need a statement that shows the effectiveness of trading urban goods for agricultural products.
  Choice A is irrelevant as it talks about government subsidies to urban manufacturers and does not mention agricultural products.
  Choice B is too broad and does not address the specific issue of urbanization and agricultural products.
  Choice C supports the assertion by stating that a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  Choice D is irrelevant as it talks about problems associated with migration being due to trade imbalances between countries, which is not related to the assertion.
  Choice E is also irrelevant as it talks about free trade policies exacerbating urbanization problems, but it does not address the effectiveness of trading urban goods for agricultural products.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The economists suggest trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population to obtain agricultural products.
  The question asks for the choice that provides the most support for the economists' assertion.
  Therefore, the correct answer should provide evidence that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population to obtain agricultural products is an effective solution.
  Choice C provides evidence that a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization, which supports the economists' assertion.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  We need to find the option which weakens this argument.
  If the mere knowledge of treatment can lead to improvement in the patient's condition, then it is possible that the patients in the first group experienced relief due to the belief that they were being treated, rather than the magnets.
  Therefore, option A is the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  The logically strongest counter to the physician's argument would be a statement that weakens the causal relationship between magnetic fields and the reduction of back pain in the first group.
  Option A suggests that the patient's knowledge of receiving treatment could lead to improvement in their condition, which could be the reason why most of the patients in the first group reported a reduction in pain.
  Option B is not relevant to the argument that magnetic fields are effective at relieving some back pain.
  Option C is also not relevant to the argument since the experiment was conducted only on patients with chronic back pain.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument since the involvement of scientists who designed the experiment does not affect the results of the experiment.
  Option E suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could be a reason why most of the patients in the first group reported a reduction in pain, which weakens the causal relationship between magnetic fields and the reduction of back pain in the first group.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment's results.
  To counter the argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the experiment's results.
  Option A suggests that the patients' knowledge of receiving treatment might have led to improvement rather than the actual treatment.
  Option B is not relevant to the argument.
  Option C is not relevant to the argument.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument.
  Option E suggests that the variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain might have influenced the experiment's results.
  Option E is the strongest counter to the physician's argument because it suggests that the experiment's results might not be reliable due to the variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the causal relationship between the use of magnets and the reduction of back pain.
  Option A suggests that a patient's knowledge of treatment can lead to improvement in his or her condition, which could be the reason for the reduction in pain in the first group.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument since it does not weaken the causal relationship between the use of magnets and the reduction of back pain.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the argument since it is about the scope of the experiment and not about the causal relationship between the use of magnets and the reduction of back pain.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument since it does not provide any evidence that weakens the causal relationship between the use of magnets and the reduction of back pain.
  Option E suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could be the reason for the reduction in pain in the first group.
  Option E weakens the causal relationship between the use of magnets and the reduction of back pain the most.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that the magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment conducted on 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to provide evidence that shows magnetic fields are not effective at relieving back pain.
  Option A is not relevant to the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  Option B is not the strongest counter to the physician's argument as it is just an opinion of most physicians and not based on evidence.
  Option C is not the strongest counter to the physician's argument as it only talks about the experiments conducted on areas other than the back.
  Option D is not the strongest counter to the physician's argument as the scientists' belief does not necessarily mean that the magnetic fields are not effective at relieving back pain.
  Option E is the strongest counter to the physician's argument as it shows that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could have led to the difference in results between the two groups.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  We need to find the answer that presents the strongest counter to this argument.
  Answer A suggests that the reduction in pain could be due to the patients' beliefs rather than the magnets.
  Answer B is irrelevant because it talks about medication and not magnets.
  Answer C is also irrelevant because we are only concerned with back pain in this experiment.
  Answer D is not a strong counter because it does not refute the results of the experiment.
  Answer E suggests that there were different causes of the back pain, which could affect the results of the experiment.
  Answer E presents the strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  The strongest counter to the physician's argument would be a statement that weakens or contradicts the physician's conclusion.
  Option A suggests that the patient's knowledge of treatment can lead to improvement in their condition, which weakens the physician's argument.
  Option B is irrelevant to the physician's argument.
  Option C suggests that there is no other evidence supporting the physician's argument, but it does not contradict the physician's conclusion.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the physician's argument.
  Option E suggests that the variation in the specific causes of chronic back pain could have influenced the results of the experiment.
  Option E weakens the physician's argument as it suggests that the variation in the specific causes of chronic back pain could have influenced the results of the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment.
  To counter the physician's argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the conclusion of the argument.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument.
  Option B is not relevant to the argument and it is also an opinion.
  Option C is not relevant to the argument because the argument is only about back pain.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument.
  Option E weakens the conclusion of the argument because the experiment did not control for the variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment. Therefore, it is likely that the variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain could have influenced the results of the experiment.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The physician concludes that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment with 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  To counter the physician's argument, we need to find an option that weakens the conclusion drawn from the experiment.
  Option A talks about the placebo effect, which is not directly related to the conclusion drawn from the experiment. 
  Option B is about the effectiveness of medication, which is not directly related to the conclusion drawn from the experiment.
  Option C talks about the scope of the experiment, which is not directly related to the conclusion drawn from the experiment.
  Option D is about the scientists who helped design the experiment, which is not directly related to the conclusion drawn from the experiment.
  Option E talks about the variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment. This suggests that the results may be due to other factors and not just the magnetic fields.
  Therefore, Option E is the strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the surprising result?
Choices:
  A: For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
  B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
  C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The Maxlast hammers were on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  The Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  We need to find a choice that explains why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice A does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice B suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices, but this does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice C suggests that customers were motivated by the sale, but this does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice D suggests that the sale was advertised, but this does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice E suggests that a single item on sale does not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, which could explain why customers who came to the store to buy hammers chose the Styron hammers instead of the Maxlast hammers that were on sale.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option C suggests that the customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, which means that the sale was the motivation for the purchase.
  So, the customers who were looking for a hammer on sale might have already purchased the Maxlast hammers, which could explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  Option C provides a possible explanation that customers who bought Maxlast hammers last week mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  This could mean that many customers who needed hammers already bought Maxlast hammers during the sale and that there were fewer customers who needed hammers this week.
  This could explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The stimulus states that all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option C suggests that the reason for the Maxlast hammers' sale was widely known, and this could have caused a temporary spike in sales that did not continue.
  Option D suggests that the sale was advertised, which could have caused people to come to the store specifically to buy Maxlast hammers.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale is not enough to motivate shoppers to make a special trip to the store.
  Option A and B do not explain the surprising result.
  Therefore, the best answer is either C or D.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance, whereas the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  The surprising result was that the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  The correct answer will provide a plausible explanation for why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice E is not relevant because it talks about a single item on sale.
  Choice B may be true, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice A may be true, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice D may be true, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice C provides a plausible explanation for why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers. If customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, it suggests that they were motivated by the sale rather than the brand of hammer. Therefore, when the Maxlast hammers were no longer on sale, these customers may have chosen to buy the Styron hammers instead.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  Option A is not relevant to the scenario.
  Option B does not explain why the Styron hammers sold more than the Maxlast hammers.
  Option C only explains why customers bought Maxlast hammers last week, but not why Styron hammers sold more this week.
  Option D explains why customers knew about the sale, but not why Styron hammers sold more than Maxlast hammers.
  Option E could explain why customers may not have come to the store specifically for the sale, but it does not explain why Styron hammers sold more than Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, none of the options provide a clear explanation of why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that Styron hammers slightly outsold Maxlast hammers even though all Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Option C indicates that customers who bought Maxlast hammers mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer. This suggests that the sale was a motivating factor for customers who bought Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, option C provides the best explanation for the surprising result.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question asks for an explanation of why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the latter being on sale.
  Choice A is not relevant to the question.
  Choice B suggests that customers are not particularly motivated by low prices, which does not explain the result.
  Choice C suggests that customers were aware of the sale but still chose to buy Styron hammers instead. This may suggest that they prefer Styron hammers over Maxlast hammers.
  Choice D suggests that the customers were aware of the sale on Maxlast hammers, but it does not explain why they chose to buy Styron hammers instead.
  Choice E suggests that a sale on a single item is not enough to motivate customers to make a special trip to the store. This does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  The best answer is C, which suggests that customers who bought Maxlast hammers last week did so because of the sale, not because they preferred Maxlast hammers over Styron hammers. This implies that customers generally prefer Styron hammers over Maxlast hammers. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  The Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  We need to find an option that explains why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option C seems to be a possible explanation because it suggests that customers who bought Maxlast hammers last week did so because of the sale and not the quality of the product.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Option A does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option B is not related to the sale of Maxlast hammers.
  Option C suggests that customers were aware of the sale, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option D suggests that the sale was advertised, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option E could explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers. If customers did not want to make a special trip to the store just for a sale item, they may have chosen to buy the more expensive Styron hammers while they were already in the store.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  If most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez because they did not watch the debate.
  If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were biased in favor of Lopez.
  If the people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were biased in favor of Lopez.
  If most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were biased in favor of Lopez.
  If Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin, it does not undermine the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that suggests the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E suggests that Lopez's victory over Tanner was not overwhelming, which means that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B weakens the argument because it suggests that the survey respondents who thought that Tanner was more persuasive were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. 
  To undermine this argument, we need to find an answer that suggests that the survey respondents were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Answer choice B suggests that the survey respondents may not have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then the survey respondents were not biased in favor of Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option A is irrelevant because it talks about people who voted in the election, not the survey respondents.
  Option B does not undermine the argument because it is talking about the live audience, not the survey respondents.
  Option C does not undermine the argument because it is talking about the voters, not the survey respondents.
  Option D does not undermine the argument because it is talking about the viewers' initial preference, not their perception of the debate.
  Option E does not undermine the argument because it does not address the issue of bias.
  None of the options undermine the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is that the viewers who thought that Lopez had made the better arguments may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  If most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate, it would mean that the debate did not have a significant impact on the election's outcome.
  If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, it would contradict the survey of viewers watching the televised debate.
  If the people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate, it would mean that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  If most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner, it would contradict the survey of viewers watching the televised debate.
  If Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin, it would not undermine the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the viewers who thought that Lopez had made better arguments may have been biased in favor of Lopez since Lopez eventually won the election.
  Answer choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Answer choice B undermines the argument since it suggests that the viewers who thought that Lopez had made better arguments may have been wrong.
  Answer choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Answer choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Answer choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a choice that suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B does not undermine the argument because it is possible that the surveyed viewers were biased in favor of Lopez even though the live audience thought that Tanner was more persuasive.
  Choice C does not undermine the argument because it is possible that the surveyed viewers were biased in favor of Lopez even though they were more likely to vote for Tanner.
  Choice D does not undermine the argument because the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate may have changed their minds after watching the debate.
  Choice E suggests that Lopez won the election by a very narrow margin, which could indicate that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is that the viewers surveyed may have been biased in favor of Lopez since he won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a choice that suggests the viewers surveyed were not biased towards Lopez.
  Choice A does not relate to the argument and is irrelevant.
  Choice B suggests that the live audience thought Tanner was more persuasive, which undermines the argument.
  Choice C is irrelevant because the argument is about the viewers surveyed, not about the voters.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it is about the viewers surveyed prior to the debate, not immediately after.
  Choice E does not undermine the argument because it does not relate to the bias of the viewers surveyed.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that there was no bias in the survey respondents' responses.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C actually strengthens the argument.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E does not undermine the argument.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the president's speech was inappropriate only if it was inflammatory, and there are no independent reasons to deem it inflammatory.

  The argument does not address the possibility that such reasons may exist.
  Therefore, the answer is A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that we should not conclude that the speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony.
  It also says that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  Therefore, the argument seems to be suggesting that there are no independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory.
  However, the argument does not provide any evidence to support this claim.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it fails to consider the possibility that there may be independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory.
  Choice B is incorrect because the argument is not discussing whether inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences.
  Choice C is incorrect because the argument is not favoring the university president's side in a dispute.
  Choice D is incorrect because the argument is not concluding that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true.

  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
  The answer is A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument is that we cannot conclude the president's speech was inflammatory based solely on Riley's testimony because of their feud.
  The conclusion is that unless there are independent reasons to deem the speech inflammatory, it is not true that it was inappropriate.
  The argument does not take for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory, so A is incorrect.
  The argument does not discuss whether inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences, so B is incorrect.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The new program tallies the number of paychecks issued by employers in X.
  Some employers issue separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  Therefore, the total number of paychecks issued does not necessarily equal the number of people employed.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions in that quarter.
  Therefore, the government's estimate of the total number of people employed in X for that quarter may have been an overestimate.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the new program may have double-counted some employees who received multiple paychecks.
  Choice D is the best answer because the government may have overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The new computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  This means that the number of paychecks tallied by the program would be greater than the actual number of people employed.
  Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
- The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. 
- The program counted the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X as its estimate of employment.
- The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter in which the program was used.
- Some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
- It is not clear whether the program is designed to account for multiple paychecks to a single employee.
- Therefore, the accuracy of the program's estimate is in question.
- The government's report of the increase in the number of people employed may be an overestimate.
- The correct answer should reflect this.

Action: Answer("D") 
The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  This implies that the number of paychecks in the first quarter may not accurately reflect the number of people employed in X.
  Therefore, the government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed in X for the first quarter using the new program may be inaccurate.
  This means that the government may have overestimated or underestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The new computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X to determine employment.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions in the first quarter.
  Therefore, the number of paychecks issued in the first quarter may not accurately represent the number of people employed.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Thus, it can be concluded that the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:

In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
Therefore, the number of paychecks issued is not an accurate representation of the number of people employed in X.
Thus, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the number of paychecks issued in the first quarter for which the program was used is likely to be greater than the actual number of people employed.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed.
  Therefore, the government's estimate of the total number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used is likely to be overestimated.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have not changed over the last 5 years, which may not be true.
  The argument assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, which may not be true.
  The argument assumes that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is the only product that the company sells, which may not be true.
  The argument assumes that the decline in market share is the only reason for the decline in net income from sales of the product.
  The argument assumes that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has not changed over the past 5 years, which may not be true.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the argument is flawed because it overlooks other possible factors that might have contributed to the decline in net income.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers five years ago.
  Currently, Wilson Appliance's hair dryer makes up only 25% of such sales.
  The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the past five years.
  It also assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is not due to an increase in the total sales of hair dryers.
  It also assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, which may not be true.
  Finally, the argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years.
  Therefore, the answer is D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument also states that the product's market share has decreased from 50% to 25%.
  The conclusion is that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  However, the argument does not consider other factors that could affect the company's net income, such as changes in the cost of production or changes in the demand for hair dryers.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the argument is flawed.
  The answer is not A because the argument does not mistake a decline in market share for a decline in total sales.
  The answer is not B because the argument provides specific information about the net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold.
  The answer is not C because the argument focuses only on Wilson Appliance's hair dryer product, not its other products.
  The answer is not D because the argument assumes that the net income per hair dryer sold has not changed, regardless of any changes in the retail price of the product.
  The answer is E because the argument does not provide any evidence that the hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's product accounts for only 25 percent of sales currently.
  The argument also states that Wilson Appliance's net income per hair dryer sold has not changed.
  The argument concludes that Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the past 5 years.
  The argument also assumes that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is the only product that the company sells.
  The argument doesn't provide any information about the price of the hair dryer.
  The argument doesn't provide any information about the profitability of Wilson Appliance's other products.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is due to a decline in total sales of hair dryers, and it doesn't consider other factors that could affect the company's net income.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer's market share has decreased from 50% to 25%.
  The argument also states that the average net income per hair dryer has not changed.
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the past 5 years.
  The argument does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed because it mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the decline in sales percentage of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer from 50% to 25% implies a decline in the company's net income from sales of the product.
  However, it does not consider other factors that may have affected the company's net income, such as the total sales of hair dryers in the market, the price of the product, or the profitability of other products.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed.
  Choice A correctly points out that the argument mistakes a decline in market share for a decline in total sales.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that the decline in Wilson Appliance's product sales caused a decline in net income, but the average net income per hair dryer sold has remained the same.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas since the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  If there are other ways that the iguana species could have arrived on the islands, then the scientist's argument is weakened.
  Therefore, we need to find the choice that provides an alternative explanation for the iguana species' presence on the islands.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the iguana species.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument because the genetic differences could have arisen after the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  Choice C does not weaken the argument because uncommon does not mean impossible.
  Choice D strengthens the argument because it provides evidence that the iguana species could have reached the islands by rafting across the ocean.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it does not address the iguana species.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas. If there are other animal species on the islands that did not come from the Americas, then it is possible that the iguana species did not come from the Americas either. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  If there are iguana species on the islands that are not found in the Americas, it weakens the argument that all the iguanas on the islands came from the Americas.
  If the genetic analysis shows that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, it weakens the argument that the iguanas on the islands came from the Americas.
  If documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon, it does not necessarily weaken the argument.
  If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, it does not necessarily weaken the argument.
  If the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, it does not necessarily weaken the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands came from the Americas by rafting on floating debris.
  To weaken this argument, we need information that contradicts this claim.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Choice B may strengthen the argument because it indicates that the iguana species on the islands are related to those found in the Americas.
  Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that rafting is uncommon.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it talks about other plant and animal species, not iguanas.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this explanation.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument and does not contradict the explanation.
  Choice B states that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, but this does not necessarily contradict the explanation.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument and does not contradict the explanation.
  Choice D states that fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, which contradicts the explanation that the iguanas rafted from the Americas.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument and does not contradict the explanation.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. 
  If there are fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, then it is possible that the iguana species on the islands are not the result of rafting from the Americas. 
  Therefore, D weakens the scientist's argument the most.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands came from the Americas by rafting on debris across the Pacific Ocean.
  If there is evidence that contradicts this argument, it would weaken the scientist's argument.
  A does not contradict the argument.
  B is not necessarily a contradiction of the argument.
  C is not a contradiction of the argument, but it is not supportive either.
  D contradicts the argument by suggesting that the iguana species could have come from Australia instead of the Americas.
  E is not a contradiction of the argument.
  Therefore, D weakens the scientist's argument the most.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands in question must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  If any of the answer choices show that the iguanas could have arrived on the islands by some other means, then it would weaken the argument.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument, but rather it strengthens it by indicating that the iguanas on the islands are different from those found in the Americas.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E suggests that there were plant and animal species in Australia or South America that existed prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, which could have then migrated to the islands in question.
  Therefore, choice E most weakens the scientist's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  To weaken this argument, we need to provide an alternative explanation for the presence of the iguana species on the islands.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument because genetic differences do not preclude the possibility of rafting.
  Choice C weakens the argument because the rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting suggests that it is unlikely that the iguanas rafted from the Americas to the islands in question.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it pertains to other plant and animal species, not iguanas.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that the species' progenitors rafted from the Americas to the islands.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find evidence that contradicts this statement.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B does not contradict the argument, but rather suggests that the iguana species on the islands have evolved differently from those in the Americas.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D suggests that the progenitors of the iguana species on the islands could have come from Australia, rather than from the Americas.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, which suggests that the progenitors of the iguana species on the islands could have come from Australia, rather than from the Americas, weakening the scientist's argument.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's design capacity would decrease safety.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bike lanes to roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  It supports this claim with the statistic that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads with bike lanes than on roads without them.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism that it overlooks an important factor that may affect the conclusion.
  Answer A is a possible criticism because it suggests that the injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bike lanes may be just as serious as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without bike lanes.
  Answer B is not a valid criticism because the argument is specifically comparing the safety of roads with bike lanes to those without, regardless of the number of bicyclists on each road.
  Answer C is not a valid criticism because the argument is only concerned with the safety of bicyclists, not motorists.
  Answer D is not a valid criticism because the argument is not claiming that only some roads with bike lanes are safe.
  Answer E is not a valid criticism because the argument is not claiming the opposite of the statistical evidence presented.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks an important possibility or flaw.
  The argument does not address the possibility that bicycle lanes reduce the severity of accidents, even if they do not reduce the frequency of accidents.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because the statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the possibility that the bicycle lanes might not have been properly designed or maintained, leading to more accidents.
Therefore, the answer is not given in the available choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks other factors that could be contributing to the higher number of collisions on roads with bicycle lanes.
  Option A points out that the argument overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  This is a valid criticism as the argument only focuses on the number of collisions and not the severity of the injuries sustained.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads will not enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes.
  However, the argument does not consider other factors such as the severity of injuries or the number of bicyclists on each type of road.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks other important factors.
  Choice A addresses the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists may be as serious on roads with bicycle lanes as on roads without such lanes.
  This criticism is relevant to the argument because it challenges the assumption that adding bicycle lanes will not enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument presents evidence that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument assumes that bicycle lanes are the cause of the increase in collisions.
  The argument does not consider other factors that may contribute to the increase in collisions.
  The argument also does not consider the possibility that bicycle lanes may enhance the safety of bicyclists in other ways.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that there are other factors that may contribute to the increase in collisions.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes.
  The argument does not address the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  The argument does not address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
  The argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  The argument does not conclude that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
  The argument takes statistical evidence that more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes as evidence that adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it assumes that the presence of bicycle lanes is the cause of the collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles, which may not be true.
  Choice A is not relevant because the argument does not compare the severity of injuries.
  Choice B is not relevant because the argument is not based on the number of bicyclists.
  Choice C is not relevant because the argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  Choice D is not relevant because the argument is not based on the safety of roads that currently have bicycle lanes.
  Choice E is the best answer because the argument uses statistical evidence to support a conclusion that is not necessarily true, and ignores other possible factors that may contribute to the collisions.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
Choice A is not relevant to the argument.

Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
Choice D is incorrect because the argument does not conclude that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
Choice E is correct because the argument takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.
Therefore, the answer is E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that designated bicycle lanes do not enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that statistics show that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  However, the argument does not consider other factors that may affect the statistics, such as the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: While it is true that bees' vision is well suited to the task of identifying flowers by their colors, it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the statement above?
Choices:
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  The answer choice that supports this statement would provide evidence that flowers evolved to attract bees.
  Answer choice A suggests that many insects similar to bees do not depend on color, which weakens the argument.
  Answer choice B is irrelevant because it does not address the evolution of flowers and bees.
  Answer choice C is irrelevant because it does not address the evolution of flowers and bees.
  Answer choice D is irrelevant because it does not address the evolution of flowers and bees.
  Answer choice E suggests that bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, which supports the argument that flowers evolved to attract bees.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The statement says that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  Therefore, we need to find an option that suggests that flowers evolved to suit bees' vision.
  Option A suggests that there are insects similar to bees that do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This option does not support the statement.
  Option B suggests that some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This option does not support the statement.
  Option C suggests that the number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This option does not support the statement.
  Option D suggests that many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This option is irrelevant to the statement.
  Option E suggests that present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This option supports the statement by implying that bees' vision is well suited to identifying flowers by their colors, and flowers are the primary food source for bees.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The statement above suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  To support this statement, we need to find an option that shows flowers developed in response to bees' vision, rather than the other way around.
  Option E seems to be irrelevant to the statement.
  Option D is also irrelevant.
  Option C is not relevant to the statement.
  Option A suggests that many insects similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color, which weakens the argument.
  Option B suggests that some flowers rely on insects other than bees, which supports the argument that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The statement is that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  To support this statement, we need to find an option that shows that the flowers evolved in response to the bees.

  Option B is also not relevant to the statement.
  Option C does not show that the flowers evolved in response to the bees.
  Option D is not relevant to the statement.
  Option E is also not relevant to the statement.
  None of the options support the statement.
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the above".
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The statement above suggests that flower color is a response to bees' vision.
  The correct answer choice will provide evidence to support this suggestion.
  Choice A provides evidence that other insects with similar vision do not rely on color perception.
  Choice B is not relevant to the relationship between bees' vision and flower color.
  Choice C is not relevant because the number of different species is not related to the relationship between bees' vision and flower color.
  Choice D is not relevant because it is about nonflowering plants, not the relationship between bees' vision and flower color.
  Choice E is not relevant because it is about the present-day reliance of bees on flowers, not the relationship between bees' vision and flower color.
  Therefore, the best answer choice is A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The statement implies that flower color developed in response to bees' vision.
  To support this, we need evidence that flowers changed to suit bees' vision.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the relationship between flowers and bees.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the relationship between flowers and bees.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the development of flower color.
  Choice A suggests that insects similar to bees do not need to perceive color, which implies that bees do have a unique need for color perception. This supports the idea that flowers developed in response to bees' unique needs.
  Choice C is not relevant to the relationship between flowers and bees.
  Therefore, the best answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
We need to find an option that supports this statement.
Option A is not relevant to the argument.
Option B is also not relevant as the statement is not limited to bees only.
Option C is not relevant to the argument.
Option D is not relevant to the argument.
Option E can be interpreted in a way that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, as bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The statement argues that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  The correct answer should support the statement by showing that bees' vision is unique and that flowers developed in response to it.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E supports the argument by showing that bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, indicating that flowers developed in response to bees' unique visual abilities.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have. To support this claim, we need an option that shows that the flowers evolved to suit bees' vision, rather than the other way around.
A: This option does not support the claim. It talks about insects that do not depend on perceiving an object's color, which is irrelevant.
B: This option does not support the claim. It talks about flowers relying on insects other than bees, which is irrelevant.
C: This option does not support the claim. It talks about the number of different species of flowers being greater than the number of different species of bees, which is irrelevant.
D: This option does not support the claim. It talks about nonflowering plants relying on bees, which is irrelevant.
E: This option supports the claim. It talks about present-day bees relying exclusively on flowers for their food. This shows that bees have evolved to depend on flowers for their food, and not the other way around.
Therefore, the answer is E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  To support this, we need to find an answer that shows that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  If other insects with similar vision to bees don't depend on perceiving color, it suggests that flowers didn't develop in response to color perception.
  If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, it suggests that the flowers did not develop in response to bees' vision.
  If the number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees, it suggests that flowers did not develop in response to bees' vision.
  If many nonflowering plants rely on bees, it does not support the statement.
  If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, it suggests that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that a diet based on fish is healthier than one based on red meat.
  However, universal adoption of this diet would lead to the extinction of the marine species on which it is based.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  Option (A) discusses the safety of vitamin E supplements and concludes that we should not recommend everyone take them.
  Option (B) discusses the potential reduction of funding for education if taxes on tobacco become too high and concludes that other sources of revenue might be needed.
  Option (C) discusses the benefits of limiting purchases and saving income but concludes that recommending this spending pattern to everyone could throw the economy into a severe recession.
  Option (D) discusses the relationship between campaigning and reelection for legislators.
  Option (E) discusses the impact of restricting land development on wilderness areas and the proliferation of species.
  Option (C) is the most similar to the argument above as it discusses a pattern of behavior that could benefit individuals but would have negative consequences if universally adopted.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument is that a diet that is healthy for people would lead to the extinction of marine species if everyone adopted it.
  This is a case where a solution that is good for one thing (health) is bad for another (marine species).
  Option C is similar as it is also a case where a solution that is good for one thing (individuals saving money) is bad for another (the economy).
  Therefore, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument presents a dilemma between health and extinction.
  If everyone adopts the healthier diet, the marine species would become extinct.
  Thus, universal adoption of the diet should not be recommended.
  Option C presents a similar situation where a spending pattern is recommended, but if everyone did it, it would lead to a severe recession.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that a diet with fish protein is healthier than one with red meat protein.
  However, if everyone adopts this diet, it will lead to the extinction of most marine species.
  Therefore, the universal adoption of this diet should not be recommended.
  The argument is about a trade-off between health and environmental concerns.
  Option A is about the trade-off between health benefits and safety concerns.
  Option B is about the trade-off between revenue generation and public health.
  Option C is about the trade-off between individual benefits and economic stability.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument.
  Option E is about the trade-off between preserving wilderness areas and supporting deer population.
  Option E is the closest to the argument in terms of trade-offs.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:

  Option C is similar to the argument above as it argues against recommending a spending pattern to everyone as it would throw the economy into a severe recession.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument states that a fish-based diet is healthier than a red meat-based diet, but universal adoption of such a diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of a fish-based diet.
  Option A talks about the potential benefits of taking vitamin E supplements but also highlights the lack of conclusive evidence about its safety for everyone.
  Option B talks about the potential negative consequences of high taxes on tobacco and how it might impact education funding.
  Option C talks about how individual spending patterns can be beneficial but if everyone adopts it, it could lead to severe economic consequences.
  Option D talks about how campaigning is necessary for legislators to get reelected, even though it takes away from their time to do their actual job.
  Option E talks about the trade-offs of restricting land development in wilderness areas.
  The reasoning in option C most closely resembles the argument above as it talks about how individual behavior can be beneficial but if everyone adopts it, it could lead to negative consequences. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument is that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat, but recommending it universally would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  The similar reasoning can be found in option C, where a spending pattern is recommended but not universally because it would lead to a severe recession.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The employee argues that website filtering software is not the only distraction in the workplace and suggests that other distractions, such as windows and decorations, are not being addressed. 
Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee the success of a novel or story. 
Both arguments suggest that a single factor (website filtering software and engaging characters, respectively) is not the only determinant of success or productivity. 
Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not the only thing that can distract employees from doing their best work.
  The argument that is most similar in its reasoning is one that argues against the idea that a single factor is the sole determinant of a certain outcome.
  Choice D argues against the idea that engaging characters are the sole determinant of a successful novel.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
The employee argues that website filtering software blocking non-work-related websites is not a solution to the problem of distraction as other factors such as offices with windows or decoration can be equally distracting. 
Option D seems to be most similar in reasoning as it argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale. Just as website filtering software does not guarantee better work, creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not effective in preventing distractions because other things like windows and decorations can also be distracting.
  Choice D argues that having engaging characters does not guarantee a sale because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that focus only on character development.
  Both arguments point out that having one thing does not necessarily lead to a desired outcome.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell.

Response 5:
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not the only source of distraction in the workplace, and that there are other sources of distraction that are not being addressed.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters is not a guarantee of success in the publishing industry, as publishers and agents may reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  Both arguments point out that a single factor is not the only determinant of a particular outcome, and that other factors may be at play.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist that are not being addressed.
  Answer choice D seems to have a similar structure, where it argues that having engaging characters is not enough to guarantee a sale.
  Both arguments point out that there are other factors at play that need to be considered.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other things in the workplace can be equally distracting. 
The correct answer choice will also present an argument that something is unnecessary because other things that are similar are not considered unnecessary.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
Answer choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale. This is similar to the employee's argument because the company's website filtering software does not guarantee that employees will be less distracted. Just as engaging characters do not guarantee a sale, website filtering software does not guarantee that employees will be more productive.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If grain prices double then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that grain-fed beef prices will come close to doubling while the price of a loaf of bread will only rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double.
  The question is asking for the answer that would most contribute to an explanation of this phenomenon.
  Option B provides information about the wholesale price of beef and bread, but it doesn't explain the difference in price increase due to the increase in grain prices.
  Option C provides information about the cost of producing bread and beef, but it doesn't explain the difference in price increase due to the increase in grain prices.
  Option D provides information about the source of beef sold in retail markets, but it doesn't explain the difference in price increase due to the increase in grain prices.
  Option E provides information about the retail grocery outlets' purchasing practices, but it doesn't explain the difference in price increase due to the increase in grain prices.
  Option A is the most likely answer because it provides information that could explain why the price of grain-fed beef would come close to doubling, while the price of a loaf of bread would only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:

  The phenomenon described is that if grain prices double, the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  The question asks what would most contribute to an explanation of this phenomenon.
  Option A is about reducing labor costs in cattle production but does not explain the price difference.
  Option B is about the wholesale price difference between beef and bread, but not about the price difference.
  Option C is about the cost structure of producing bread and beef but does not explain the price difference.
  Option D states that most beef sold is grain-fed, which explains the price difference.
  Option E is about the retail outlets' purchasing practices but does not explain the price difference.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that if grain prices double, the price of bread will rise 10-15%, while the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  The researcher has already shown that the lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available in monitoring copper pollution.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to provide additional evidence that lichens can be used to monitor other pollutants as well.
  Choice E states that lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
  This provides evidence that lichens can be used to monitor other pollutants as well.
  Therefore, choice E most strengthens the researcher's argument.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis should not be considered a commensal because it causes tuberculosis in some people.
  To undermine this reasoning, we need to show that there is a flaw in the argument.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning, so it cannot be the answer.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that the number of people who benefit from the presence of H pylori is much greater than the number of people who suffer from stomach ulcers caused by it, while the number of people who benefit from the presence of M tuberculosis is much smaller than the number of people who suffer from tuberculosis caused by it. Therefore, the argument's reasoning that H pylori should not be considered a commensal while M tuberculosis should not be considered a commensal is flawed.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response and only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick.
  The argument compares H pylori with M tuberculosis to support its claim.
  The correct answer choice will undermine the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning and therefore does not undermine it.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E undermines the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis because it suggests that more people benefit from the presence of H pylori than from the presence of M tuberculosis.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it can cause stomach ulcers, despite its alleged immune-strengthening benefits.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  The correct answer choice will undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choices A and B do not relate to the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice D is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice E does not relate to the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal despite strengthening the immune response because it is the primary cause of stomach ulcers. The counterexample presented is that M tuberculosis is not a commensal despite only causing illness in 10% of people who harbor it. Therefore, the argument rests on the assumption that the primary cause of illness is the most important factor in determining whether a bacterium is a commensal. 
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
C: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the presence of a bacterium that causes illness does not preclude it from being a commensal.
D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
E: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument is trying to show that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers, even though only a small percentage of people who harbor it actually get sick.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which also does not cause sickness in the majority of people who harbor it.
  The argument assumes that the only reason to consider a bacterium a commensal is if it provides some benefit to the host.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not relevant or that the argument's assumption is false.
  Choice C, which states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, does not support the argument's assumption and shows that the comparison between the two bacteria is not relevant.
  Therefore, C is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal even though only 10% of people who harbor it get sick.
  The correct answer will undermine this comparison.
  A is irrelevant because it does not affect the argument's reasoning.
  B is irrelevant because it does not affect the argument's reasoning.
  C supports the argument's reasoning, so it cannot be the correct answer.
  D is irrelevant because it does not affect the argument's reasoning.
  E undermines the comparison because there are more people who harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis, which means that even if the same percentage of people get sick from both bacteria, H pylori would still cause more illnesses overall.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal despite the fact that it allegedly strengthens the immune response because it plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers.
  The argument is then compared to M tuberculosis which is not considered a commensal despite the fact that only about 10% of the people who harbor it get sick from it.
  The question asks for the choice that most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning.
  If there is a reason why H pylori should be considered a commensal despite its role in stomach ulcers, then the argument's reasoning would be undermined.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D and E are not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument uses M tuberculosis as an example to support this claim because even though only 10% of people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it, it is not considered a commensal.
  The correct answer choice will undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C seems to support the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E, however, undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that the number of people who harbor H pylori is greater than the number of people who harbor M tuberculosis, which could explain why H pylori is considered a commensal even though it can cause stomach ulcers.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument then uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample, stating that only about 10 percent of people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it, yet no one would call it a commensal.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that shows that M tuberculosis and H pylori are not comparable in terms of their ability to act as commensals.
  Choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which is a significant difference from H pylori, which allegedly strengthens immune response.
  Therefore, choice C most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal despite only causing illness in a small percentage of people who harbor it.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a reason why the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Choice A does not address the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D does not address the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice E supports the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, the best answer is C.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Principle: Any person or business knowingly aiding someone's infringement on a copyright is also guilty of copyright infringement. Application: Grandview Department Store, which features a self-service photo-printing kiosk, is guilty of copyright infringement since a customer using the kiosk infringed on a wedding photographer's copyright by printing photographs whose copyright is held by the photographer.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to justify the application of the principle?
Choices:
  A: The operator of a business has the same legal obligations to customers who use self-service facilities as it has to customers who use full-service facilities.
  B: The management of a business that is open to the public is obligated to report to the authorities any illegal activity that it witnesses on its property.
  C: The owner of a self-service printing kiosk should post a notice advising customers that copyrighted material should not be printed at the kiosk without the permission of the copyright holder.
  D: Owners of self-service facilities should monitor those facilities in order to ensure that they are not used for illegal or unethical purposes.
  E: A person or business providing a service that can be expected to be used to infringe on a copyright should be considered to knowingly aid any copyright infringer using the service. 15

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

  As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  To cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, we need to find an option that contradicts the evidence.
  Option A, B, C, and D do not contradict the evidence.
  Option E is irrelevant to the evidence.
  Therefore, none of the options contradict the evidence.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The evidence offered by naturalists in support of the claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 km away.
  We are looking for an option that casts doubt on the validity of this evidence.
  Option A suggests that the bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory. This implies that the bear may not have been able to navigate over a considerable distance and instead had to rely on trial and error.
  Option B is irrelevant to the evidence offered.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the evidence offered.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the evidence offered.
  Option E suggests that polar bears rely on their sense of smell to navigate and not their ability to remember routes. This casts some doubt on the validity of the evidence offered by the naturalists.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

  They cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  We need to find an option that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Option B states that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  This means that the polar bear could have been familiar with the area where it was released.
  Therefore, option B casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
Action: Answer("B")

Thought: 
  The argument is that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  We need to find an option that casts doubt on the validity of this evidence.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear was not moving in a straight line towards its home territory.
  Option B suggests that the polar bear was released on its annual migration route, which could mean that the polar bear was already familiar with the area.
  Option C suggests that the terrain the polar bear traveled through was not unfamiliar to it.
  Option D is irrelevant.
  Option E suggests that polar bears rely on their sense of smell to navigate, which could mean that the polar bear used its sense of smell to find its way home rather than navigational skills.
  Option A, B, and C could cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, but option B is the most likely to do so.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered to support this claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  To weaken the validity of this evidence, we need to find an option that shows that the bear could have navigated its way back home through means other than a sense of direction.
  Options A, B, C, and D do not provide any such information.
  Option E suggests that polar bears rely on their sense of smell to find their way back home.
  If the polar bear in question also relied on its sense of smell to find its way back home, then the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim may not be valid.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.
Action: Answer("E")

Response 6:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence they cite is an instance of a polar bear returning to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  If one of the following is true, it would cast the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.
    - A: If the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, it would suggest that the bear was not using navigational abilities but rather a trial and error approach.
    - B: If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it would suggest that the bear was following a known path rather than using navigational abilities.
    - C: If the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, it would not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
    - D: If polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, it would not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
    - E: If polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, it would not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.

  The evidence offered in support of the claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  We need to find an option that casts the most doubt on the validity of this evidence.
  Option A tells us that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, which means it may have been following its sense of smell or other cues and not necessarily navigating over a considerable distance.
  Option B tells us that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, which means the bear may have been returning home for other reasons and not necessarily due to its navigational abilities.
  Option C tells us that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, which does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option D tells us that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, which does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option E tells us that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, which means the bear may have been following its sense of smell and not necessarily navigating over a considerable distance.
  Option A, B, D, and E do not cast the most doubt on the validity of the evidence, but Option C does.
  If the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, then it is possible that the bear was able to find its way home by following scent trails or other cues in the snow and ice, rather than by navigating over a considerable distance.
Action: Answer("C")

Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We need to find an option that weakens this evidence.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, indicating that it may not have been navigating based on memory.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, which indicates that the polar bear may have been able to navigate based on its natural migratory instincts rather than its memory.
  Option C is irrelevant to the evidence offered.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the evidence offered.
  Option E suggests that polar bears rely on their sense of smell to navigate, which does not necessarily weaken the evidence that the polar bear in question navigated based on memory.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory. This option suggests that the polar bear may not have been navigating based on memory. 
Action: Answer("A")

  The evidence cited is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We need to find an option that casts doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  If the polar bear was able to return home by following its annual migration route or by relying on its sense of smell, then it does not necessarily prove that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  Option A talks about the polar bear stopping and changing course several times, but it does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option B and E provide alternative explanations for how the polar bear was able to return home.
  Option C and D are not relevant to the validity of the evidence.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence.
  The argument provides evidence from Western and non-Western countries and Scandinavia to support the claim.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The question asks for a criticism of the argument's reasoning that the argument overlooks.
  Choice A, B, C, and E do not seem to be relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D could be relevant because the argument assumes that the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have the same effect on preventing colon cancer.
  If the fiber in fruits and vegetables and the fiber in cereals have different cancer-fighting properties, then the argument's conclusion may not be valid.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  It also claims that colon cancer rates are higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods.
  The argument further states that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument may be vulnerable to criticism if it overlooks the possibility that there are other factors that contribute to colon cancer rates.
  The answer could be B, D, or E.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C does not contradict the argument, as it does not deny the importance of fiber in preventing colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that a high-fiber diet is negatively correlated with colon cancer.
  The argument supports the claim by showing that colon cancer rates are lower in non-Western countries with high-fiber diets.
  The argument also shows that areas with lower consumption of cereals have higher colon cancer rates.
  The question asks for a possibility that the argument overlooks.
  Answer choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice B suggests that high-fiber diets reduce the risk of cancer, which supports the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice C is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice D is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice E suggests that other substances in foods containing fiber may prevent colon cancer, which weakens the argument's reasoning by introducing an alternative explanation.

Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that the colon cancer rate is much higher in Western countries where people eat less fther-rich foods compared to non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods.
  The argument also supports this claim by stating that in Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fther.
  The question asks for a criticism of the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is not a criticism of the argument's reasoning, but rather a clarification of the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E is a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning because it suggests that the correlation between fther consumption and colon cancer incidence may be due to other factors in the foods containing fther.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that colon cancer rate is lower in non-western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods and that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if it overlooks other possibilities that explain the relationship between fther and colon cancer.
  Option A is irrelevant because the argument does not mention anything about the trend of fther consumption.
  Option B is incorrect because the argument only focuses on the relationship between fther and colon cancer.
  Option C is irrelevant because it does not weaken the argument's claim that fther prevents colon cancer.
  Option D is incorrect because the argument does not mention anything about the cancer-fighting properties of fther in fruits and vegetables and cereals.
  Option E is a possible explanation for the relationship between fther and colon cancer. If foods containing fther also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer, then the argument's claim that fther prevents colon cancer may be weakened.

  Choice A is irrelevant because it doesn't address the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about other types of cancer, not colon cancer.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it doesn't address the argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it talks about the different properties of fther in different foods, not the argument.
  Choice E is relevant because it suggests that other substances in foods containing fther may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, not fther itself.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
  The argument supports its claim by demonstrating a negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  The argument does not consider other factors that might affect colon cancer rates.
  Therefore, the argument may be vulnerable to criticism.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity but they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those living in the wild.
  The correct answer should explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those living in the wild.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it talks about other large aquatic reptiles.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about sea turtles in general.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it talks about leatherbacks that perish in the wild.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it talks about zoologists' knowledge of establishing an artificial environment.
  Choice E, if true, can explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those living in the wild. If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, then it is possible that captive leatherbacks are not actually living longer than those in the wild.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  Leatherbacks in the wild are not exposed to the same diseases.
  However, the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both cases.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the life expectancy is the same.
  Choice C provides a reason why life expectancy is the same.
  If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then those that survive may have a similar life expectancy to those in captivity.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  The argument also states that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
  Therefore, we need to find an answer that explains why the life expectancy of leatherbacks is similar in both environments despite the fact that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  Answer choice C explains that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators. This means that the fatal diseases that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to are not a significant factor in reducing their life expectancy compared to those in the wild.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  It also states that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between these two statements.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a statement that explains why leatherbacks can reach their maximum life expectancy in captivity despite being susceptible to fatal diseases.
  Choice C suggests that the cause of death for most leatherbacks in the wild is predation, which does not affect those in captivity.
  This would explain why the leatherbacks in captivity can reach their maximum life expectancy despite being susceptible to fatal diseases.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument mentions that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  However, the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
  Therefore, we need to find an answer that resolves the discrepancy between the two statements.
  Option C talks about how leatherbacks perish in the wild, which is unrelated to the issue.
  Option A and B provide irrelevant information.
  Option D talks about the knowledge of zoologists, which is not relevant to the issue.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the issue.
  Therefore, none of the given options helps to resolve the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
  The answer should show why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it doesn't address the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it doesn't address the argument.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because it doesn't address the argument.
  Choice D doesn't address the argument. It talks about the difficulty of establishing an artificial environment, but it doesn't relate to the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  Choice E is the most relevant to the argument. If the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, then it is possible that captive leatherbacks are not actually living as long as they appear to be. This would explain why they are susceptible to fatal diseases yet still have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy as leatherbacks in the wild.
Therefore, the answer is E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  It also states that despite this, the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the likelihood is the same despite the susceptibility to diseases in captivity.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice C does not explain why the likelihood is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice D is close, but it does not explain why the likelihood is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice E might explain why the likelihood is the same in captivity and in the wild, because it suggests that the size of a leatherback is not necessarily an indicator of its age, which could affect the calculation of maximum life expectancy.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks living in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild, yet their likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy is the same as those living in the wild.
  The apparent discrepancy is that one would expect that leatherbacks living in captivity would have a shorter life expectancy due to the diseases they are susceptible to.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why their life expectancy is not affected by the diseases they are susceptible to.
  Choice C provides a possible explanation that leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, which means that the diseases they are susceptible to may not be the primary cause of death.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  The passage also states that the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same in captivity or in the wild.
  The question asks which answer choice resolves the discrepancy.
  A, B, C, and D do not explain the discrepancy.
  If E is true, it could explain why captive leatherbacks have a similar likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as wild leatherbacks.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases, but their likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy is the same as those living in the wild. 
  The discrepancy is that captivity should be more harmful, but it doesn't seem to be the case.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why captivity is not more harmful.
  Choice C provides a reason why leatherbacks in the wild might not live as long as they could.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.

Choices:
  A: Wilke & Wilke have produced more new shows for this season than they produced last season.
  B: Most of the shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year were police dramas.
  C: None of the shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were not canceled were police dramas.
  D: All of the new shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were canceled were police dramas.
  E: None of the most popular television shows last year were police dramas.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produce for this season will be canceled because most of the new shows they produced last season were canceled due to insufficient viewership and few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that police dramas are not likely to be popular this season as well.
  Option B provides information that most of the shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year were police dramas.
  If most of the shows produced last year were police dramas and they were canceled, then it is likely that the new police dramas produced this season will also be canceled due to insufficient viewership.
  Therefore, option B most helps to strengthen the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
The argument states that most of the new television programs that Wilke & Wilke produce for this season will be canceled. It also states that their new shows are police dramas, and few police dramas have been popular in recent years. Therefore, to strengthen the argument, we need to provide evidence that supports the idea that police dramas are unlikely to be popular this season. 
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is also irrelevant because it talks about the previous season's shows, not the current season's shows.
Option C is irrelevant because it talks about the previous season's shows that were not canceled, not the current season's shows.
Option D is relevant because it states that all the new shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were canceled were police dramas. This supports the argument that police dramas are unlikely to be popular this season.
Option E is also relevant because it states that none of the most popular television shows last year were police dramas. This supports the argument that police dramas are unlikely to be popular this season.
Therefore, we need to choose between options D and E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that most of the new shows produced by Wilke & Wilke for this season are likely to be canceled.
  The reason given is that most of the new shows produced by the company last season were canceled due to insufficient viewership, and few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that there is a higher chance that the new shows produced by Wilke & Wilke this season will also be canceled.
  Option B helps to strengthen the argument by stating that most of the shows produced by Wilke & Wilke last year were police dramas.
  This suggests that the company has a history of producing police dramas that are not popular with viewers and are likely to be canceled.
Action: Answer("B")

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument states that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produced for this season will be canceled.
  The reason for this is that most of the new shows they produced last season were canceled due to insufficient viewership.
  Furthermore, their new shows are all police dramas, and few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
  Therefore, the answer choice that would strengthen the argument would provide additional evidence that police dramas are unlikely to be popular.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
The argument states that most of the new television programs produced by Wilke & Wilke for this season will be canceled and few police dramas have been popular in recent years. We need to find an option that strengthens the argument.
  A: This option does not help the argument. It is irrelevant to know how many new shows Wilke & Wilke produced.
  B: This option does not strengthen the argument. It tells us that most of the shows produced last year were police dramas but does not relate to the argument that most of the new shows will be canceled.
  C: This option does not help the argument. It only tells us that the shows that were not canceled were not police dramas.
  D: This option strengthens the argument. It tells us that all of the new shows that were canceled last year were police dramas. This supports the argument that the new police dramas produced this year are likely to be canceled.
  E: This option does not help the argument. It only tells us that none of the most popular shows last year were police dramas.
  
  Therefore, the answer is D: All of the new shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were canceled were police dramas.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: History provides many examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable. This shows that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: People correctly believe that technological innovations often cause job loss.
  B: People are often reluctant to take on new challenges.
  C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
  D: People tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations.
  E: People correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  The argument supports the claim by providing examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people.
  The correct answer will undermine the claim that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  If people are willing to embrace technological innovations, then it shows that the desire for comfort or safety can be a powerful determinant of human behavior.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
  The argument supports this claim by citing historical examples of people resisting technological innovations that would have improved their working conditions.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that suggests that people's behavior is more influenced by their desire for comfort or safety than by social inertia.
  Choice A doesn't address the issue of whether social inertia or the desire for comfort and safety is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
  Choice B is a general statement that doesn't address the issue of whether social inertia or the desire for comfort and safety is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
  Choice C weakens the argument by providing a counterexample to the claim that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
  Choice D suggests that people can adapt to technological innovations, but it doesn't address the issue of whether social inertia or the desire for comfort and safety is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
  Choice E doesn't address the issue of whether social inertia or the desire for comfort and safety is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.

  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the claim that social inertia is more powerful than the desire for comfort or safety.
  If people have embraced technological innovations in the past, that suggests that the desire for comfort or safety can be a powerful determinant of human behavior.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  The argument supports this claim by providing evidence that technological innovations have been strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find evidence that suggests that people's desire for comfort or safety is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than social inertia.
  Choice A does not directly address the argument.
  Choice B is a general statement that does not directly address the argument.
  Choice C weakens the argument by providing evidence that some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, suggesting that social inertia is not always a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  Choice D weakens the argument by suggesting that people tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations, suggesting that social inertia is not always a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  Choice E does not directly address the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is either C or D.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that history provides many examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable.
  To undermine the argument, we need to provide evidence that social inertia is not the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C provides evidence against the argument.
  Choice D weakens the argument but does not undermine it.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
  The argument provides evidence that technological innovations have been strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable.
  If there are examples of technological innovation that have been embraced by workers, then social inertia may not be as powerful a determinant of human behavior as the argument claims.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that social inertia is more powerful than the desire for comfort or safety.
  It supports this claim by stating that people resist technological innovations that would improve their working conditions.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that opposes this claim.
  Answer choice C states that some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
  If workers have embraced some technological innovations, then the argument's claim that social inertia is more powerful than the desire for comfort or safety is weakened.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  If there are examples of technological innovations that have been embraced by workers, then it suggests that the desire for comfort or safety can be a powerful determinant of human behavior.
  Therefore, option C most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  The argument supports this claim by saying that technological innovations were strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable.
  The answer choice that undermines the argument should weaken the claim that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  Answer choice C, which says that some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, undermines the argument by providing a counterexample to the premise that people always resist technological innovations.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  The argument supports this claim by providing evidence of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable.
  To undermine this reasoning, we need to provide evidence that social inertia is not the only, or the most powerful, determinant of human behavior.
  Choice C provides evidence that workers have embraced some examples of technological innovation, which suggests that social inertia is not the only factor at play.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of all consumers think that "Hero" dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are accurate and that the current market share of Harrold Foods is more than 50%.
  The argument does not commit the error of failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition.
  The argument does not commit the error of treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true.
  The argument does not commit the error of taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  The argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result. The survey results show that "Hero" dominates the market, but it does not guarantee that Harrold Foods dominates the market. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that "Hero" already dominates the market based on survey results that show 72% of all consumers think it does.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are accurate and representative of the entire market, which may not be the case.
  The argument also assumes that maintaining the current market share is sufficient to continue dominating the market, which may not be true if competitors are gaining market share.
  The error in reasoning is mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of consumers think that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument uses a definition of market dominance as a product with more than 50% of the sales in a market.
  However, the argument does not consider the possibility of changes in market conditions or the potential for competitors to gain market share.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero" is the most popular drink with more than 50% of the sales in the market.
  The argument uses survey results to support this claim.
  The argument assumes that the current market share of "Hero" will remain constant.
  However, the argument does not consider the possibility that other companies may introduce new products that may affect the market share of "Hero" in the future.
  The argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  Therefore, the answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument is assuming that since 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market, it is true. 
  This is an error in reasoning because the argument is mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  Therefore, the answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market based on the survey results that show that 72 percent of all consumers think that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the current market condition will remain the same in the future.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are accurate and reliable.
  The argument does not commit the error of failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition.
  The argument does not commit the error of treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true.
  The argument does not commit the error of taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  The argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result. The fact that "Hero" has more than 50 percent of the sales in the market is a necessary condition for dominating the market, but it is not sufficient to guarantee that Harrold Foods will continue to dominate the market in the future.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that "Hero" dominates the market because 72% of consumers believe it does and any product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is dominant.
  The argument fails to acknowledge that the survey results may not be accurate or representative of the entire market.
  The argument also assumes that maintaining the current market share will guarantee continued dominance, which may not be true if competitors increase their market share.
  The error in reasoning is mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that since Hero has more than 50% of the sales in the market, it is dominant in that market.
  The argument further supports this claim by stating that 72% of all consumers believe that Hero dominates the market.
  However, this argument fails to consider the possibility that the new advertising campaign may affect the sales of Hero in the future.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of assuming that the current market share of Hero is sufficient to maintain its dominance in the market without considering the effect of future changes.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
  The argument uses the survey results to support the conclusion that Harrold Foods dominates the market.
  The survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are accurate and reliable.
  The survey results only reflect the current market conditions and consumer opinions.
  The argument does not consider the possibility of future changes in market conditions or consumer preferences.
  The argument commits the error of E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
  The argument supports the conclusion by stating that any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market and survey results show that 72 percent of all consumers think "Hero" dominates the market.
  The argument does not seem to commit an error in reasoning.
  Option B describes an error in reasoning where a condition required if a certain result is to obtain is mistaken for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  This is the error in reasoning committed by the argument.

Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find a statement that justifies the publisher's prediction.
  The fact that the game can be purchased directly from the publisher or from retailers does not help to justify the publisher's prediction.
  If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, it means that the game will continue to be rented or purchased for a while, but it does not necessarily mean that sales will exceed expectations.
  The fact that the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market is not enough to justify the prediction.
  If most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, it means that they are more likely to purchase the game, but it does not necessarily mean that sales will exceed expectations.
  If some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, it does not necessarily mean that sales will exceed expectations.
Action: Answer("B")  
The fact that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game helps to justify the publisher's prediction that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to look for an option that supports the idea that the game will continue to be in demand.
  Option B may suggest that people will take longer to complete the game, but it does not indicate that the game will continue to be in demand.
  Option C suggests that the publisher has a good reputation for creating popular games, but this does not guarantee that this specific game will continue to be in demand.
  Option D suggests that people will not continue to play the game, which does not support the idea that the game will continue to be in demand.
  Option E suggests that some people will buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, which does not support the idea that the game will continue to be in demand.
  Option A suggests that the game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers, which means that the game is available from multiple sources, increasing the chances that it will continue to be in demand.
  Therefore, Option A is the best answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find a statement that indicates why sales will increase.
  The game's popularity is already high, as evidenced by the game's sales and rental figures.
  Option A is not relevant to the prediction.
  Option B may indicate that the game is too long to be completed in two days, which may lead to more rentals and sales.
  Option C may suggest that the publisher has a loyal customer base, but it does not explain why sales of this particular game will exceed expectations.
  Option D may indicate that the game has limited replay value, which could lead to fewer sales, not more.
  Option E may indicate that more people will be exposed to the game, but it does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.
  Therefore, Option B is the best answer because it suggests that players will need to rent or purchase the game for longer than two days to complete it, which could lead to more sales and rentals.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The publisher's prediction is that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals.
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  Therefore, the justification for the publisher's prediction must be related to the rental or purchase of the game.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Choice C only indicates the popularity of the publisher's games and does not relate to the rental or purchase of the game.
  Choice D indicates that most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, which is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Choice E indicates that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, which is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Choice A suggests that the game is widely available, which may increase the number of sales.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the publisher's expectation.
  The game's rental is exceeding expectations, which means more people are playing the game.
  Therefore, the option that supports the idea that more people are playing the game and enjoying it will justify the publisher's prediction.
  Option B talks about the time it takes for players to complete the game, but it does not support the idea that more people are playing the game.
  Option A is not relevant to the prediction.
  Option C is also not relevant to the prediction.
  Option D suggests that people who complete the game do not play it again, which does not support the idea that more people are playing the game.
  Option E suggests that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, which does not support the idea that more people are playing the game.
  Therefore, none of the options justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that most helps to justify the prediction.
  If most people who rent the game also purchase it, then sales will exceed expectations.
  The rebate offered to renters who go on to purchase the game will encourage renters to purchase the game.
  Therefore, the option that most helps to justify the prediction is the one that indicates that renters are likely to purchase the game.
  Option B is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option A and E do not provide any information about the renters' behavior.
  Option C is a general statement about the publisher's games and does not directly relate to the new game.
  Option D suggests that most people will not purchase the game after completing it.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports the prediction.
  The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals.
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  Therefore, if we can find an option that suggests that people who rent the game are more likely to purchase it, then it would support the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then it is more likely that renters will go on to purchase the game. This is because they have invested a lot of time in playing the game and would not want to lose their progress. Therefore, this option supports the publisher's prediction.
Response 7:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find a statement that supports the prediction.
  The fact that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game may mean that sales will not exceed expectations soon.
  Option A is irrelevant as it talks about the availability of the game.
  Option C is also irrelevant as it talks about the popularity of the publisher's games but not specifically about the latest adventure game.
  Option D is not helpful as it talks about the behavior of players after completing the game.
  Option E may or may not be helpful as it talks about people giving the game away, but it doesn't give us any information to support the prediction.
  Therefore, Option B is the most helpful as it suggests that people who rent the game may take several weeks to complete it, which may lead them to purchase the game instead, thus supporting the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that justifies this prediction.
  Option A is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option C states that the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market, but it doesn't explain why sales of this particular game will exceed expectations.
  Option D suggests that most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, which may decrease the demand for the game.
  Option E suggests that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, which may decrease the sales of the game.
  Option B states that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, which implies that most renters will end up purchasing the game to avoid paying for multiple rentals. Therefore, this option justifies the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The publisher's prediction is that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  The rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations.
  We need to find the option that can justify the publisher's prediction.
  Option B is irrelevant to the publisher's prediction.
  Option A does not help justify the prediction.
  Option C is not enough to justify the prediction.
  Option D does not help justify the prediction.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the publisher's prediction.
  Therefore, None of the options justify the publisher's prediction.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably.
  The argument then concludes that the party's economic theories were fur off the mark because the inflation rate actually increased.
  This is flawed reasoning because it assumes that the party's economic theories were sound to begin with, which may not be the case.
  Choice C has similar flawed reasoning where it assumes that the company's plan to sell its subsidiaries was successful to begin with, which may not be the case.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and its program was successful, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably.
  However, the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
  The argument incorrectly assumes that the party's economic theories were sound and that the only reason they failed was that they were not implemented correctly.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in choice C, which assumes that the only reason the company's stock price did not increase was that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have decreased. But since the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  This argument is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories were sound and that their implementation was the only factor that influenced the inflation rate.
  Choice C most closely resembles this flawed reasoning because it assumes that the company's success in selling its subsidiaries was the only factor that would have caused the stock price to double, and it concludes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries because the stock price did not increase.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. 
  However, the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The reasoning is flawed because it makes a false assumption that if the economic theories were sound, the inflation rate would have decreased.
  Therefore, the answer is the choice that has a similar flawed reasoning.
  Choice C has a similar flawed reasoning because it assumes that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. But since the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were far off the mark.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories were the only factor that could have affected the inflation rate, ignoring other possible factors.
  Choice C is similar in that it assumes that the company's failure to sell its subsidiaries was the only factor that could have affected the stock price, ignoring other possible factors.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument above suggests that if the party's economic theories were sound, then the inflation rate would have lessened. 
  But because the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were far off the mark.
  This is flawed reasoning because it assumes that the only reason the inflation rate increased was that the party's economic theories were wrong.
  The reasoning in option C most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above because it assumes that the only reason the stock price did not increase is that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  This ignores other factors that could have affected the stock price.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument above states that if the party's economic theories were sound, the inflation rate would have lessened, but since the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark. This is a flawed reasoning because there could be other factors that contribute to the increase in inflation rate.
  Choice A is flawed reasoning because it assumes that the architecture in the valley would have changed if the people were invaded or if there was a climatic change. There could be other reasons why the architecture remained the same.
  Choice B is flawed reasoning because it assumes that the workers will not strike just because they promised not to. There could be other reasons why the workers would strike.
  Choice C is flawed reasoning because it assumes that the only way for the stock price to double is if the company sells its subsidiaries and purchases a new patent. There could be other factors that contribute to the stock price increase.
  Choice D is flawed reasoning because it assumes that the residents' support for the rebels is solely based on the outcome of the battle. There could be other reasons why the residents support the rebels.
  Choice E is flawed reasoning because it assumes that the only way for the accuracy of weather forecasts to rise is if the new equipment is worth the investment. There could be other factors that contribute to the accuracy of weather forecasts.
  The argument in the question is most similar to Choice C because it assumes that the only way for the stock price to double is if the company sells its subsidiaries and purchases a new patent. There could be other factors that contribute to the stock price increase. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument above states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have decreased. However, the inflation rate increased, so the party's economic theories were flawed.
  Choice C states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  Both arguments use a conditional statement, but the conclusion is based on the opposite of what was expected to happen.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument presents a hypothetical situation and states that it did not occur, therefore the original assumption must be flawed.
  The argument is similar to the reasoning in which one of the following arguments:
  A: Presents a hypothetical situation and states that it did not occur, therefore the original assumption must be true.
  B: Assumes that because a group of people promised not to do something, they must believe that another group will keep their promise.
  C: Presents a hypothetical situation and states that it did not occur, therefore the original assumption must be true.
  D: Assumes that because a group of people showed support for something, the thing they supported must have occurred.
  E: Presents a hypothetical situation and states that it did not occur, therefore the original assumption must be true.
  The argument is most similar to C, which presents a hypothetical situation and states that it did not occur, therefore the original assumption must be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that the party's economic theories were off the mark because the inflation rate increased instead of decreasing.
  The reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories were sound, which may not be true.
  Choice C has a similar flawed reasoning because it assumes that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries, which may not be true.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Government official: Residents who are foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries. This is wise, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. So, ____.
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the government official's statement?
Choices:
  A: foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve
  B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries
  C: only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries
  D: foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries
  E: cabinet undersecretaries should not be expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries
Response 0:
Thought:
  The government official argues that cabinet secretaries should be citizens because they perform duties that only citizens should perform.
  The official also argues that undersecretaries should be able to serve as secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, the most logical answer would be an answer that supports the official's argument.
  Answer choice A is not relevant to the official's argument.
  Answer choice B goes against the official's argument that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels.
  Answer choice C is not relevant to the official's argument.

  Answer choice E goes against the official's argument that undersecretaries should be able to serve as secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because some duties should only be performed by citizens. Also, cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable. Therefore, the most logical statement to complete the official's argument should be consistent with the argument and provide additional support. 
Action: Answer("B")  
The statement that most logically completes the government official's argument is "foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries." This statement is consistent with the official's argument that some duties should only be performed by citizens, and it also addresses the concern about cabinet undersecretaries potentially serving as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because some duties should be performed only by citizens.
  The official also notes that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, the statement that best completes the official's argument should address the issue of whether foreign citizens can perform the duties of a cabinet secretary.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the official's argument.
  Choice B is too extreme. It is not necessary to exclude all foreign citizens from serving as undersecretaries.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the official's argument.
  Choice D contradicts the official's argument.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the official's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:

  The government official argues that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels but not as cabinet secretaries because cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  The official also argues that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, the statement that logically completes the official's argument should support the idea that some duties of cabinet secretaries should be performed only by citizens and that a cabinet undersecretary should be able to perform those duties.
  The only answer that supports this idea is D: foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The government official argues that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries.
  The official also argues that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform.

  Therefore, the answer is D: foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because they are not citizens and cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should only be performed by citizens.
  The official also notes that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, it would be inconsistent to appoint a foreign citizen as a cabinet undersecretary if they would not be eligible to serve as cabinet secretary.
  The statement that would logically complete the official's argument would be that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because they perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  The official also argues that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development should be regulated to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that wetland development is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
  The question asks which principle would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  Choice A is irrelevant since it refers to international agreement, which is not at issue between the two commissions.
  Choice B supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, not the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice C is irrelevant since the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position is to regulate development once it has been found to reduce populations of endangered species.
  Choice D is also irrelevant since it argues that environmental regulation cannot allow for different degrees of environmental harm, which is not at issue between the two commissions.
  Choice E argues against the Figorian Development Commission's position that wetland development is necessary for growth.
  Therefore, none of the choices support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  The answer is "None of the Above".

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
Response 0:
Thought:
The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed into law because those who would be adversely affected are very influential.
The best principle that justifies this argument is that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. This principle supports the idea that the bill is not being passed because the influential people who oppose it are preventing it from becoming law.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and not violating basic human rights will not be passed because of the opposition of influential people. 
Option A is not valid as it states that any bill favored by most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights. This doesn't address the issue of influential people opposing the bill.
Option B is similar to option A and doesn't address the issue of influential people opposing the bill.
Option C is the best answer as it states that a bill favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. This supports the columnist's argument that influential people opposing the bill can prevent it from becoming law.
Option D is not valid as it states that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights. This doesn't address the issue of influential people opposing the bill.
Option E is not valid as it states that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights. This doesn't address the issue of influential people opposing the bill.
Therefore, the answer is C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights will not be passed into law due to the influence of those who would be adversely affected.
Option A is incorrect because the columnist's argument is that the bill will not be passed, even if it would benefit most people. 
Option B is incorrect because the columnist's argument is that the bill will not be passed, even if it is favored by most people. 
Option C is consistent with the columnist's argument that the bill will not be passed if those who oppose it are very influential.
Option D is incorrect because it does not address the issue of the bill being blocked by influential people.
Option E is incorrect because the columnist's argument is that the bill will not be passed, even if it is favored by most people.
Therefore, the best answer is C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights will not be passed into law if those who oppose it are very influential.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that humans would be just as content with six fingers if we had evolved from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to show that humans are content with configurations of equal usefulness.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B weakens the argument by suggesting that humans are not content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  Choice C strengthens the argument by suggesting that humans are always content with two things of equal usefulness.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  The biologist argues that if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
  To strengthen the biologist's argument, we need to show that the number of fingers humans have is not related to its usefulness.
  Choice A does not help to strengthen the argument.
  Choice B and C are not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D supports the argument but it does not strengthen it.
  Choice E supports the argument by providing an example of a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that humans' configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, and humans would be just as content with those configurations.
  To strengthen the biologist's argument, we need to show that humans are content with different configurations of fingers, or that the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on our prejudices.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument.
  Option B weakens the argument by suggesting that humans are not content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  Option C supports the argument, but it does not strengthen it.
  Option D supports the argument, but it does not strengthen it.
  Option E provides evidence that supports the biologist's argument that other configurations of fingers are possible.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The biologist argues that humans would be just as content with six fingers on each hand if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
To strengthen this argument, we need to find an answer that supports the idea that humans' contentment with our current configuration of fingers is not based on the configuration's usefulness.
Option A is not relevant to the argument.
Option B weakens the argument by introducing a condition that humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
Option C is too strong and absolute to be true.
Option D supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not accurate.
Option E is not relevant to the argument; it is just a fact that does not support or weaken the biologist's argument.
Therefore, the best answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is not inherently better than other possible configurations.
  The argument can be strengthened by showing that the usefulness of our configuration is not a result of our prejudices.
  Choice D suggests that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  Therefore, choice D most strengthens the biologist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that our configuration of five fingers is not necessarily more useful than other possible configurations.
  The biologist also argues that if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
  The answer choice that most strengthens the biologist's argument would provide support for either of the two arguments mentioned above.
  Answer choices A, B, and C are irrelevant to the biologist's argument.
  Answer choice D supports the biologist's argument but does not necessarily strengthen it.
  Answer choice E supports the biologist's argument that there is at least one species of fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that the configuration of fingers is not more or less useful than other possible configurations.
  Therefore, the argument would be strengthened if it is shown that humans are content with other configurations of fingers.
  Choice A does not strengthen the argument because it does not address other possible configurations of fingers.
  Choice B weakens the argument by introducing the idea that humans are never content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  Choice C also weakens the argument by introducing the idea that humans are always content with two things of equal usefulness.
  Choice D supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusion.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument because it only talks about the existence of a species of fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that humans would be just as content with six fingers if we had evolved from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen this argument, we need evidence that supports the idea that the number of fingers is not inherently more useful than other configurations.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B contradicts the argument and is not relevant.
  Choice C is a restatement of the argument and not evidence to support it.
  Choice D is relevant to the argument, but it weakens rather than strengthens it.
  Choice E provides evidence that supports the idea that other configurations are possible, which strengthens the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that humans would be just as content with six fingers per hand if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to show that humans would be content with any configuration of fingers that is equally useful.
  Choice A does not strengthen the argument because it does not address the issue of usefulness.
  Choice B weakens the argument because it suggests that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness.
  Choice C strengthens the argument by stating that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  Choice D supports the argument but does not directly strengthen it.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is an actuary because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that were made.
  Answer choice A weakens the argument by suggesting that the accountants were more closely scrutinized.
  Answer choice B weakens the argument by suggesting that someone outside the corporation could have accessed the records.
  Answer choice C does not weaken the argument because it does not address the detective's reasoning.
  Answer choice D weakens the argument by suggesting that the corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place.
  Answer choice E weakens the argument by suggesting that the actuaries had less access to the records than the accountants.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the option that does not weaken the argument.
  Option A weakens the argument by suggesting that the accountants were more closely scrutinized than the actuaries.
  Option B weakens the argument by suggesting that someone outside the company could have committed the embezzlement.
  Option C weakens the argument by suggesting that there were more accountants than actuaries.
  Option D weakens the argument by suggesting that the company was already vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place.
  Option E does not weaken the argument because it suggests that the actuaries had less access to internal financial records than the accountants.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries because accountants would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  Weaknesses in the argument would be statements that suggest that the embezzler could still be an accountant or that the argument is flawed.
  Choice A suggests that the actuaries were more closely scrutinized than the accountants, which could make it less likely that one of the actuaries would be the embezzler.
  Choice B suggests that someone outside the company could have had access to the financial records, which would weaken the argument that the embezzler must have worked for the company.
  Choice C provides information about the relative numbers of accountants and actuaries, but this does not directly address the detective's argument.
  Choice D suggests that the company was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place, but this does not directly address the detective's argument.
  Choice E suggests that the security measures at the company could have made it more difficult for the actuaries to commit the crime, which could weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff. This does not directly address the detective's argument.
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler must be an actuary because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  The question asks which answer choice does NOT weaken the detective's argument.
  Answer choices A, B, C, and D provide alternative explanations for the embezzlement or cast doubt on the detective's assumptions.
  Answer choice E, on the other hand, supports the detective's argument by making it more likely that the embezzler is an actuary.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler must have been one of the actuaries because an accountant would not have made the mistakes that were made.
  Answer choice A does not weaken the argument because it states that the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized than those of the accountants.
  Answer choice B weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside the company could have accessed the internal financial records.
  Answer choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that there were more accountants than actuaries on staff.
  Answer choice D does not weaken the argument because it is about a report that was released before the crime took place.
  Answer choice E weakens the argument because it suggests that it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the option that does not weaken this argument.
  Option A provides additional support for the detective's argument, so it does not weaken the argument.
  Option B suggests that someone outside the corporation could have accessed the internal financial records, which weakens the argument.
  Option C suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, which weakens the argument.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E suggests that it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, which weakens the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not have made the mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the statement that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  A weakener would be a statement that provides an alternative explanation for the embezzlement that does not involve an actuary.
  A does not weaken the detective's argument because it supports the possibility of an accountant being the embezzler, which is the detective's alternative hypothesis.
  B, C, D, and E all provide alternative explanations for the embezzlement that do not involve an actuary, which weakens the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the option that does not weaken the argument.
  Option A weakens the argument because if the actuaries were more closely scrutinized, they would be less likely to embezzle than the accountants.
  Option B weakens the argument because if someone outside the company had access to the internal financial records, the embezzler could be anyone, not necessarily an actuary or an accountant.
  Option C weakens the argument because there are more accountants than actuaries, so it is more likely that the embezzler is an accountant.
  Option D weakens the argument because it suggests that the company was already vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place.
  Option E is the most likely answer because it does not weaken the argument. It suggests that the security measures at the company made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than the accountants, which supports the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as an actuary because an accountant would not make mistakes in ledger entries.
  We need to find the statement that does not weaken the argument.
  A weakens the argument because it suggests that the accountants could have made mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  B weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside of XYZ Corporation could have had access to the internal financial records.
  C weakens the argument because it suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, so it is more likely that the embezzler was an accountant.
  D weakens the argument because it suggests that the corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place, so the embezzler could have been anyone.
  E is the statement that does not weaken the argument because it suggests that it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, which strengthens the argument that the embezzler was an actuary.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. 
Option A weakens the argument because it suggests that the accountants were more closely scrutinized than the actuaries, making it more likely that an accountant could have committed the crime.
Option B weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside the company could have gained access to the internal financial records, making it less likely that the embezzler was an employee of the company.
Option C is irrelevant to the argument because it only provides information about the number of accountants and actuaries employed by the company.
Option D is also irrelevant because it only provides information about a report released before the crime took place.
Option E weakens the argument because it suggests that it would have been more difficult for the actuaries to have access to the internal financial records than for the accountants.
Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff. It does not weaken or strengthen the argument.

Context: One should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone.
  B: I have no reason to think that the practical joke I want to play would harm anyone. So, since the joke would show no contempt for the person the joke is played on, it would not be wrong for me to play it.
  C: Because of the circumstances, it would be wrong for me to play the practical joke I had intended to play on you. Even though it would not show contempt for anyone, it could easily bring you significant harm.
  D: It would have been wrong for me to play the practical joke that I had intended to play on you. Even though I did not have reason to think that it would significantly harm anyone, I did think that it would show contempt for someone.
  E: Someone was harmed as a result of my practical joke. Thus, even though it did not show contempt for the person I played the joke on, I should not have played it.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

  Choice A is not relevant to the goals of executives.
  Choice B is talking about the profits of owners of movie theaters and not the goals of movie executives.
  Choice C compares the cost of producing an hour of film to the cost of producing an hour of television and is not relevant to the goals of executives.
  Choice D is talking about the profits of television shows and not the goals of television executives.

Action: Answer("D")  
The statement that best explains the difference between the goals of movie and television executives is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. This statement suggests that television executives may be more concerned with the demographics of their viewers than with the total number of viewers, since sponsors are interested in reaching specific groups of consumers. In contrast, movie executives are primarily concerned with maximizing the number of viewers, since this is what determines whether a film makes a profit.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film.

  Option A is irrelevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option B discusses the profits of owners of movie theaters and is not relevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option C discusses the cost of producing an hour of film and television, but it does not explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  Option D is relevant because it suggests that the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show is more important to sponsors than the number of people who watch the show. This could explain why television executives are less concerned with maximizing the number of viewers for their shows.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the goals of movie and television executives.

Action: Answer("D") 
Reasoning: 
  The correct answer is D because it explains why television executives are not primarily concerned with maximizing the number of viewers for their shows. If television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show, then television executives will be more concerned with attracting a certain demographic of viewers rather than maximizing the total number of viewers. This is different from movie executives, who are primarily concerned with maximizing the number of people who see a film, regardless of their purchasing power.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  We need to find a reason that explains this difference in goals.
  Option A is not helpful in explaining the difference in goals because the number of times people watch a film or a television show is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option B is also not helpful because the profits from refreshments are not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option C is also not helpful because the cost of producing a film or a television show is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option D is a plausible explanation because it suggests that television executives are more concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch their shows, which is not the same as maximizing the number of viewers.
  Option E is not helpful because it does not explain the difference in goals between movie executives and television executives.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  We need to find an option that explains why television executives' goals are different from movie executives' goals.
  Option A does not explain the difference in goals.
  Option B talks about the refreshments sold in movie theaters but does not explain why television executives do not aim to maximize the number of viewers.
  Option C talks about the cost of producing a film versus an hour of television but does not explain the difference in goals.
  Option D talks about how television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. This option explains the difference in goals because television executives' primary goal is to attract viewers who have purchasing power, not necessarily to maximize the number of viewers.

  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  The works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
  Prints of all of the museum's permanent collection are available in the museum store.
  Prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks, are also available in the museum store.
  Therefore, A and C are not true.
  Every print sold in the museum store is of a twentieth-century work because the museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  Hopper's Nighthawks is not on loan to the museum from a private collector, so D is not true.
  The curator didn't mention whether Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum or not.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  These works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
  Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  Therefore, we can infer that:
  A: Every print in the museum store is not necessarily of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection. This is because the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work. This is true because the museum only displays twentieth-century works.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector. This is false because the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector. This is false because Hopper's Nighthawks is not part of the museum's permanent collection and is not on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum. This is true because Hopper's Nighthawks is not part of the museum's permanent collection and is not on loan to the museum from a private collector.
Therefore, the answer is E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:

  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  Therefore, Hopper's Nighthawks is not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  Therefore, Hopper's Nighthawks is not on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  Therefore, Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.
  Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.
Response 0:

Thought:
  The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Choice A and Choice B describe scenarios where the person did not know about the consequences of their actions and could not have reasonably foreseen them. Therefore, they should not be blamed for any misfortune that results from their actions.
  Choice C describes a scenario where the person was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but still served it anyway. Therefore, the person should be blamed for any misfortune that results from their actions.
  Choice D describes a scenario where Dr. Fitzpatrick gave the wrong medicine to his patient without knowing that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, Dr. Fitzpatrick should be blamed for any misfortune that results from his actions.
  Choice E describes a scenario where dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire, and any reasonable person could have foreseen this. Therefore, Kapp should be blamed for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

  Choice A: Riley did not think about the possible traffic accident, so he could not have foreseen it. Therefore, he should not be blamed for it.
  Choice B: Oblicek had no idea that her suggestion would cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen it. Therefore, she should not be blamed for it.
  Choice C: Gougon was concerned that the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, so he could have foreseen it. Therefore, he should be blamed for it.
  Choice D: Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know about the side effect of the wrong medicine, so he could not have foreseen it. Therefore, he should not be blamed for it.
  Choice E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, which any reasonable person could have foreseen would start a fire. Therefore, she should be blamed for it.
  The answer is either A or B. Both choices describe scenarios where the person did not foresee the misfortune, and could not have reasonably foreseen it. However, the scenario in choice A is more straightforward and clear. Therefore, the answer is A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it. 
Action: Answer("A")

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that juries are not fair for trials involving scientific or technical issues because jurors without specialized knowledge are systematically excluded.
  The correct answer choice should weaken this argument.
  Choice A strengthens the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend testimony.
  Choice B weakens the argument by stating that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced in favor of one of the parties.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it discusses arbitrators, not juries.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it discusses expert testimony, not the selection of jurors.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it discusses the cost of expert witnesses, not the selection of jurors.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that jurors without specialized knowledge are excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant, thus trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that shows the trial by jury is a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Option A strengthens the argument.
  Option B does not provide any information on whether trial by jury is a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D does not provide any information on whether trial by jury is a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the most plausible answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that juries are not fair when the issues involved are scientific or technical because jurors lack specialized knowledge.
  The correct answer choice will show that juries can be fair even if jurors lack specialized knowledge.
  Choice A supports the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge may not comprehend the testimony.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument. It states that jurors with specialized knowledge may be biased, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it discusses arbitrators, not juries.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it discusses how experts give testimony, not the fairness of juries.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it discusses the cost of expert witnesses, not the fairness of juries.
  Therefore, the best answer is A because it supports the argument, and the argument claims that juries are not fair when jurors lack specialized knowledge. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that juries are not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are excluded.
  The correct answer will show that juries are still a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  A, B, C, and E do not provide any evidence that juries are still a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  D shows that expert witnesses tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error, which weakens the argument that juries are not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument is that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because jurors without specialized knowledge are systematically excluded from juries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that this exclusion does not necessarily make the trial unfair.
  Choice A supports the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony.
  Choice B suggests that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced in favor of one party, which weakens the argument.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries.
  We need to weaken this argument.
  Choice A supports the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge may not comprehend the testimony.
  Choice B supports the argument by stating that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E weakens the argument by suggesting that expert witnesses are often too expensive for many people to afford, which means that juries may be the only option for settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries, making trials involving scientific or technical issues unfair.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that the exclusion of jurors with specialized knowledge doesn't necessarily make trials unfair.
  Choice A supports the argument that jurors need specialized knowledge to understand complicated issues.
  Choice B suggests that jurors with specialized knowledge may be biased, which supports the argument.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument about juries.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument about juries.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument about juries.
  None of the choices weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries and thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
  The answer choice that weakens the argument should show that trial by jury is still a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Answer choice A shows that jurors without specialized knowledge may still be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  Answer choice B suggests that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins, which strengthens the argument.
  Answer choice C discusses the fairness of appointing an impartial arbitrator, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Answer choice D discusses the possibility of error in expert testimony, which is not relevant to the argument.

  The argument claims that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because jurors without specialized knowledge are systematically excluded from juries.
  We need to find a statement that weakens this argument by showing that trial by jury is a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Choice A supports the argument.
  Choice B suggests that jurors with specialized knowledge may be biased which helps the argument.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, none of the choices weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that juries are not fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that juries are still a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Choice A does not weaken the argument because it supports the idea that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument because it suggests that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument because it discusses arbitrators, not juries.
  Choice D does not weaken the argument because it suggests that experts may not be certain in their conclusions.
  Choice E weakens the argument because it suggests that people involved in litigation may not be able to afford expert witnesses, which means that juries may be the only means of settling disputes.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals because of the presence of biomarkers.
  The opposing scientists argue that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  The geologist's argument is weakened if it is shown that biomarkers can exist without the presence of living organisms.
  Choice A suggests that fossils can exist without biomarkers, which weakens the geologist's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum indicates that it was formed from the remains of living organisms.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  If there is an alternative explanation for the presence of biomarkers in petroleum, then the geologist's argument would be weakened.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C supports the geologist's argument.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E suggests an alternative explanation for the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that petroleum is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  The opposing scientists argue that petroleum is formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  The geologist refutes the opposing scientists' theory by pointing out the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  To weaken the geologist's argument, we need to find an answer that challenges the idea that biomarkers are only present in petroleum that comes from living organisms.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the origin of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it does not address the formation of petroleum.
  Choice C is consistent with the opposing scientists' theory and does not weaken the geologist's argument.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it does not address the origin of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Choice E is the most promising answer because it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which would explain the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.

  The geologist's argument is that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum indicates that it was formed from the fossilized remains of living organisms.
  To weaken this argument, we need to provide an alternative explanation for the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Choice A, B, C, and D do not provide alternative explanations for the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Choice E, on the other hand, weakens the geologist's argument by providing an alternative source for the biomarkers.
  If some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, then it is possible that the biomarkers in petroleum were derived from those carbon deposits, rather than from the fossilized remains of animals.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that petroleum is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  The opposing scientists argue that petroleum is formed from deep carbon deposits.

  Answer choice A is irrelevant to the geologist's argument.
  Answer choice B supports the opposing scientists' argument.
  Answer choice C strengthens the opposing scientists' argument.
  Answer choice D is irrelevant to the geologist's argument.
  Answer choice E is irrelevant to the geologist's argument.
  Therefore, the most plausible answer is B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum refutes the theory that it formed from deep carbon deposits.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts or weakens the idea that biomarkers only come from living organisms.
  Choice A is irrelevant because the argument is not about all fossils, but specifically about biomarkers in petroleum.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it does not address the argument about the source of petroleum.
  Choice C supports the geologist's argument that it would take a long time for organisms to become petroleum.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it does not address the argument about the source of petroleum.
  Choice E weakens the geologist's argument by suggesting that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which could explain the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")

  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer that contradicts the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Choice A is irrelevant because fossils without biomarkers do not contradict the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Choice B also does not weaken the argument because it does not address the formation of petroleum.
  Choice C supports the opposing theory and does not weaken the argument.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because the presence of bacteria does not contradict the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Choice E is the most likely answer because it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which supports the geologist's argument, but weakens it by suggesting that not all petroleum is formed from living organisms.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum indicates that it was formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that shows the presence of biomarkers does not necessarily mean petroleum was formed from living material.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about when living organisms emerged, not about petroleum formation.
  Choice C supports the geologist's argument, so it cannot weaken it.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E weakens the geologist's argument because it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which would mean that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum does not necessarily indicate that it was formed from living material.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The student assumes that people who are not affected by harmful symptoms have immunity to staphylococcus.
  However, there may be other reasons why some people are not affected by staphylococcus.
  This pattern of reasoning is flawed.
  Option A is also flawed because it assumes that everything that is morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
  Option B is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
  Option C is flawed because it assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not necessarily true.
  Option D is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
  Option E is flawed because it assumes that doctors are the only ones responsible for preventing disease, which is not necessarily true.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is most similar to option C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The student's argument is that if people do not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to staphylococcus, then they have immunity to it.
  This is flawed because some people may not show symptoms but are still susceptible to the microorganism.
  This is similar to answer choice C, where the conclusion is based on an assumption that has not been proven.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
The student's argument is based on a conditional statement where immunity to infection by a microorganism means no harmful symptoms.
The student then concludes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms means immunity to infection by this microorganism.
The argument is flawed because not all people who are exposed to staphylococcus develop harmful symptoms, and not all people who do not develop harmful symptoms are immune to infection by this microorganism.
To find the answer that has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning, I need to look for an argument that has an unsupported conclusion or assumes a causal relationship that is not established.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The student claims that if someone is not affected by a microorganism, then they must have immunity to it.
  The fact that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms does not necessarily indicate that they have immunity to it.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is equivalent to immunity.
  The pattern of reasoning is most similar to option C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The student argues that because many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms, they must have immunity to the microorganism.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is the same as immunity.
  The argument is most similar to option C, where the speaker assumes that since medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill, she must not have taken the medication.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that medication is always effective and that there are no other reasons why Isabel could still be ill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The student's argument is based on the assumption that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, and therefore, they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. This assumption may not be true.
  Option A presents a flawed reasoning pattern that is different from that of the student's argument.
  Option B presents a flawed reasoning pattern that is different from that of the student's argument.
  Option C presents a flawed reasoning pattern that is different from that of the student's argument.
  Option D presents a flawed reasoning pattern that is different from that of the student's argument.
  Option E presents a flawed reasoning pattern that is similar to that of the student's argument because it is based on an assumption that may not be true.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The student's argument is based on a false assumption.
  The false assumption is that exposure without harmful symptoms implies immunity.
  This pattern of reasoning is similar to another flawed pattern of reasoning.
  The argument in choice C is similar because it also makes a false assumption.
  The false assumption is that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
  Therefore, the answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The student argues that if a person is not affected by a microorganism, then they are immune to it.
  The student then argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, they must have immunity to it.
  The argument assumes that everyone who is exposed to staphylococcus has the same immune response.
  This is similar to answer choice C, which assumes that medication cures or alleviates all diseases. 
  Both arguments make assumptions that are not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The student assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms implies that a person is immune to infection by a microorganism.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it neglects the possibility that the person may be susceptible to the microorganism but not experience any symptoms.
  The argument is most similar to option C, where the speaker assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and therefore, Isabel is not taking the medication because she is still ill.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it neglects the possibility that the medication may take time to work, or Isabel may not be taking the medication as prescribed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The student assumes that because many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The study found that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need to find an option that explains why workers with the least control over their own work had a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option A is irrelevant as it talks about the amount of typing done by workers with the most and least control over their own work.
  Option B talks about emotional stress, but it does not relate to the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option C is also irrelevant as it talks about the position of the typist's arms and hands, which is not related to the control over their own work.
  Option D is irrelevant as it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards.
  Option E seems plausible because it talks about office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This could explain why workers with the least control over their own work had a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need a statement that supports the study's findings.
  Option A is incorrect because it states that workers with the most control do less typing, which is irrelevant to the study's findings.
  Option B is incorrect because it provides a reason why lack of control leads to nerve disorders, but it does not support the study's findings.
  Option C is incorrect because it provides a different reason for carpal tunnel syndrome, which is the position of the hands and arms when typing. It does not support the study's findings.
  Option D is incorrect because it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards.
  Option E is the most likely answer because it suggests that workers with more control over their own work perform repetitive motions other than typing more often, which is consistent with the study's findings.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The study found that workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  The question is asking for the choice that helps to explain the study's findings.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it talks about the amount of typing done by office workers with most control and least control over their own work. It does not support or explain the study's findings.
  Choice B is plausible because it talks about emotional stress which is known to have an impact on the development of nerve disorders. It is possible that feeling a lack of control over one's own work can lead to emotional stress which in turn makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  Choice C talks about the keyboards on which office workers type. It is possible that the keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This choice is plausible because it provides a possible explanation for the study's findings.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it talks about repetitive motions other than typing.

Thought:
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  The question is asking which choice most helps to explain the study's findings.
  Choice A is not helpful because it says that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work. The study is comparing office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  Choice B might be helpful because it suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  Choice C is not helpful because it only talks about the keyboards on which office workers type, and the study is not comparing the keyboards.
  Choice D is not helpful because it is talking about office workers who rarely use keyboards, and the study is specifically looking at office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  Choice E is not helpful because it talks about office workers performing repetitive motions other than typing, and the study is specifically looking at typing.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous, despite the fact that this drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy indicated above?
Choices:
  A: The drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available.
  B: The drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low.
  C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
  D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
  E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The question stem mentions that the drug for chicken pox is effective and has no serious side effects, yet the researchers warn against its widespread use. 
  To reconcile this discrepancy, we need to find an answer choice that explains why the researchers are warning against the widespread use of the drug despite its effectiveness and lack of serious side effects.
  Answer choices A and B do not address the effectiveness or side effects of the drug, so they are unlikely to reconcile the discrepancy.
  Answer choice C also does not explain why the researchers are warning against the drug's widespread use.
  Answer choice D provides a reason why the drug should not be used indiscriminately, and it suggests that the drug could be dangerous if misused. This helps to reconcile the discrepancy.
  Answer choice E suggests that the drug could contribute to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug, which would be a serious concern for public health. This answer choice also helps to reconcile the discrepancy.
  However, answer choice D is more directly related to the safety of the drug itself, so it is the better answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The antidote for chicken pox is effective, but researchers warn against its widespread use.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between the effectiveness of the drug and the warning against its widespread use.

  Choice A suggests that the drug is expensive and difficult to make widely available, but this does not explain why its use could be dangerous.
  Choice B suggests that patient compliance is likely to be low, but this does not explain why the drug should not be widely used.
  Choice C suggests that the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox, which could be a reason why its use could be dangerous.
  Choice D suggests that the drug can be fatal when misused, which could be a reason why its use could be dangerous.
  Choice E suggests that the use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox, which could be a reason why its use could be dangerous.
  The best answer is a reason why the drug should not be widely used and could be dangerous.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The statement says that the antidote for chicken pox is very effective and has no serious side effects.
  However, the researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  The question asks for the option that helps to reconcile the apparent discrepancy.
  Option A is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Option B is also irrelevant, as it talks about patient compliance and not the apparent discrepancy.
  Option C is also irrelevant, as it talks about the spread of chicken pox and not the discrepancy.
  Option D does not help to reconcile the discrepancy, as it provides another reason for the antidote to be dangerous.
  Option E, on the other hand, provides a reason for the researchers' warning, as the use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The antidote for chicken pox is effective at limiting the duration and severity of the disease.

  There is no serious side effect of the drug.
  The question asks for the option that helps most to reconcile the discrepancy.
  Option A and B do not help to reconcile the discrepancy.
  Option D and E strengthen the warning against the widespread use of the drug.
  Option C explains why the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The antidote for chicken pox has no serious side effects and is currently effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  Researchers warn that the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous.
  We need to find an option that helps to reconcile the discrepancy above.
  Option A is not relevant as the question is not about the cost of the drug.
  Option B is not relevant as the question is not about patient compliance.
  Option C is not relevant as the question is not about the spread of chicken pox.
  Option D is relevant as it suggests that the drug can be fatal when misused, which could be one of the reasons why researchers are warning against the widespread use of the drug.
  Option E is not relevant as it suggests that the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox, which is not mentioned in the context.
  Therefore, the answer is D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question is asking to reconcile the discrepancy between the statement that the drug is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox, and the statement that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  The answer should provide a reason why the drug's widespread use could be dangerous.
  Option A is not relevant to the discrepancy.
  Option B is also not relevant to the discrepancy.
  Option C provides a reason why the drug's widespread use may not be effective at preventing the spread of chicken pox, but does not explain why its use could be dangerous.
  Option D provides a reason why the drug's widespread use could be dangerous, but it does not explain why the drug is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  Option E provides a reason why the drug's widespread use could be dangerous and also explains why its use could lead to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage states that the antidote for chicken pox is currently effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox, but its widespread use could be dangerous.
  The correct option will help to reconcile this discrepancy.
  Option A is irrelevant to the discrepancy, so it is not the correct answer.
  Option B is also irrelevant because low patient compliance does not explain the danger of the widespread use of the drug.
  Option C is also irrelevant because the drug's inability to prevent the spread of chicken pox does not explain the danger of its widespread use.
  Option D is interesting because it suggests that the drug can be dangerous if misused. However, the passage states that the drug has no serious side effects, so it is not the best answer.
  Option E is the best answer because it suggests that the widespread use of the drug could contribute to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug, which would make it dangerous to use the drug widely.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
The question asks for the choice that helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between the effectiveness of the drug and the warning against its widespread use. 
The passage states that the drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox. However, researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous. 
Choice A is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
Choice B is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
Choice C may explain why the drug's widespread use could be dangerous, but it does not reconcile the apparent discrepancy between the drug's effectiveness and the warning against its widespread use.
Choice D suggests a serious side effect of the drug and provides a reason why the drug's widespread use could be dangerous. This choice reconciles the apparent discrepancy between the drug's effectiveness and the warning against its widespread use.
Choice E suggests that the use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug. This choice does not reconcile the apparent discrepancy between the drug's effectiveness and the warning against its widespread use.
Therefore, the answer is D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The antidote for chicken pox is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  Researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  We need to find a statement that helps to reconcile the apparent discrepancy.
  If the drug is expensive or difficult to make widely available, it would limit the widespread use of the drug and therefore reduce the danger.
  If the drug has to be administered several times a day, patient compliance is likely to be low, which would limit the widespread use of the drug and therefore reduce the danger.
  If the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, it would limit the widespread use of the drug and therefore reduce the danger.
  If the drug can be fatal when misused, it would limit the widespread use of the drug and therefore reduce the danger.
  If the use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug, it would increase the danger of widespread use.
  The best answer is the one that limits the widespread use of the drug and therefore reduces the danger.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The antidote for chicken pox is effective in limiting the duration and severity of the disease.
  Researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  We need to find an option that reconciles the apparent discrepancy.
  Option A is not related to the effectiveness of the drug or its dangers.
  Option B talks about the issue of patient compliance, but doesn't reconcile the discrepancy.
  Option C also doesn't reconcile the discrepancy. It presents a new issue with the drug.
  Option D is a serious issue, but it doesn't reconcile the discrepancy.
  Option E is a serious issue and could be the reason researchers warn against the widespread use of the drug.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument presents a knowledgeable person's prediction about an event.
  The event did not happen as predicted.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that the event was not properly executed.
  The argument is similar to (C).
  In (C), the argument presents a knowledgeable person's prediction about an event.
  The event did not happen as predicted.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that the repair was not properly done.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is based on the reasoning that if the concert was not poorly promoted, it would have sold out.
  But the concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above is one that uses a similar conditional statement and concludes that the condition was not met.
  Option A is similar in structure, but it concludes that the condition was not met based on the fact that the patient did not survive the surgery.
  Option B is also similar in structure, but it concludes that the condition was not met based on the fact that the sample does not contain organic compounds.
  Option C is not similar in structure, as it concludes that the repair was not properly done based on the fact that the damage is still noticeable.
  Option D is not similar in structure, as it concludes that the builder was probably wrong based on the fact that the roof is already leaking.
  Option E is not similar in structure, as it concludes that the tests were properly conducted based on the fact that lead was found in the soil.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument provides a premise that Wells is knowledgeable about the concert business and believed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The argument provides a conclusion that the concert did not sell out.
  The conclusion is based on the premise that the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  Thus, the pattern of reasoning is that the conclusion is based on a premise that something would have happened unless something else had occurred.
  The answer is A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument presents a knowledgeable person's opinion about an event.
  The event did not meet the expectation of the knowledgeable person.
  Therefore, the event was probably not done properly.
  The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above is the one that presents a knowledgeable person's opinion about an event, the event did not meet the expectation of the knowledgeable person, and therefore, the event was probably not done properly.
  The argument in option C presents a knowledgeable person's opinion about an event, the event did not meet the expectation of the knowledgeable person, and therefore, the event was probably not done properly.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning where Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, expected the concert to sell out unless it was poorly promoted. The concert did not sell out, so it was probably poorly promoted.
  Choice A presents a similar pattern of reasoning where Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, expected the patient to survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. The patient did not survive the surgery, so it was probably not properly performed.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument presents a knowledgeable person's expectation and compares it to the actual outcome to draw a conclusion.
  Choice A presents a knowledgeable person's expectation and compares it to the actual outcome to draw a conclusion.
  Choice B's argument is different because it uses a conditional statement to draw a conclusion about the sample's labeling.
  Choice C's argument is different because it uses a knowledgeable person's expectation to draw a conclusion about the quality of the repair work.
  Choice D's argument is different because it uses a knowledgeable person's expectation to draw a conclusion about the builder's assessment of the roof's durability.
  Choice E's argument is different because it uses an expert's expectation to draw a conclusion about the quality of the tests.
  Therefore, the pattern of reasoning in which choice A is most similar to that in the argument above.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument presents a knowledgeable person's prediction that the concert would sell out if it were properly promoted.

  The concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, the concert was probably poorly promoted.
  The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
  Answer: The pattern of reasoning involves making a prediction based on expertise and then concluding that the prediction is false if the expected result does not occur. 
  Option A presents a similar pattern of reasoning. Dr. Smith predicted that the patient would survive if the surgery were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. The patient did not survive, so Dr. Smith concluded that the surgery was probably not properly performed.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
The argument is about a prediction made by Wells and the result not meeting the prediction.
Option A is similar in that it is about a prediction made by Dr. Smith and the result not meeting the prediction.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The argument is about Diplodocus's feeding habits and how its neck structure would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse high-growing vegetation. 
The assumption required by the argument would be a statement that supports the conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground or underwater.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is not mentioned in the argument.
Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
Option D is opposite to the argument as it says that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
Option E is relevant to the argument as it says that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, which supports the conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground or underwater. 
Therefore, the answer is E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that computer models have shown Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument also concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument would be a statement that connects the conclusion with the premise.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is the opposite of what the argument concludes.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument, but it does not connect the conclusion with the premise.
  Therefore, none of the choices is a required assumption.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not have raised its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus could have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The argument must assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is a possible assumption required by the argument.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not have browsed for high-growing vegetation because of its neck structure.
  The argument then suggests that the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  None of the answer choices accurately reflect this assumption.
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Instead, it could bend downward and extend its neck to access underwater vegetation.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  An assumption required by the argument must be something that is necessary for the conclusion to be true.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not related to the argument.
  Choice D is not necessary for the conclusion to be true.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument because it suggests that Diplodocus had limited ways of accessing underwater vegetation.
  If Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or walking into them, then it might not have had to feed on plants on or near the ground.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not have raised its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation due to its neck bones' structure.
  Instead, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument should be an essential premise that connects the evidence to the conclusion.
  The argument does not mention anything about modern ground-feeding animals, Diplodocus's vision, or the blood supply to its brain.
  The argument also does not assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
  The only assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, as the argument states that Diplodocus must have fed on underwater vegetation from dry land.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is about what Diplodocus ate and how it ate.
  The argument is based on computer models of Diplodocus's neck bones.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument should be related to the argument's conclusion.
  The argument does not mention anything about modern ground-feeding animals, the ability to see, or blood supply to the brain.
  The assumption should be about Diplodocus's ability to access high-growing vegetation.
  The argument mentions that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  The answer is D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the computer models that show Diplodocus's neck bones could not have allowed it to raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  An assumption required by the argument would be a premise that supports the conclusion.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not related to the argument.
  Choice D is opposite to the argument's conclusion as it suggests another way for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument as it challenges the possibility of Diplodocus browsing for underwater vegetation.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is about the feeding habits of Diplodocus.
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck high enough to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  An assumption required by the argument must be that Diplodocus only fed on plants that it could access.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is the opposite of what the argument concludes.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument because if Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then the argument's conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater would not be valid.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus could not have raised its neck to reach high-growing vegetation.
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level to feed on underwater vegetation.
  The assumption required by the argument must be related to the neck structure of Diplodocus.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester has not received a raise, so it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation.
Question: The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
  B: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  C: My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house. Since anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own it.
  D: My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Since no one who lives in a house both O'WIlS it and pays rent on it, it must be that my next-door neighbors pay rent on their heuse.
  E: Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Therefore, it must be that they pay rent on it.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument in the context is that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester has not received a raise, so it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation. This argument is flawed because there could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise.
  Option A is similar to the flawed argument because the argument assumes that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. Therefore, the neighbors cannot own the house and pay rent on it. This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why they pay rent on the house.
  Option B is the correct answer because it assumes that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. Therefore, the neighbors cannot pay rent on the house and own it. This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why they own the house and do not pay rent on it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Lester has received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise.
  The argument assumes that receiving a poor performance evaluation is the only reason why someone would not receive a raise.
  The argument does not consider other reasons why someone may not receive a raise.
  Choice A has a similar flawed reasoning, as it concludes that the neighbors do not own their house because they pay rent on it, without considering other reasons why someone may pay rent on a house.
  Therefore, the answer is A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Lester has received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise.
  The argument assumes that the only reason someone at Leila's Electronics would not receive a raise is because they received a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument does not consider other reasons why someone at Leila's Electronics would not receive a raise.
  Answer choice A has similar flawed reasoning as it assumes that the only reason someone pays rent on a house is that they do not own it.
  Answer choice B has the opposite flawed reasoning as it assumes that the only reason someone owns a house is that they do not pay rent on it.
  Answer choice C has similar flawed reasoning as it assumes that the only reason someone owns a house is that they do not pay rent on it.
  Answer choice D has the opposite flawed reasoning as it assumes that the only reason someone pays rent on a house is that they do not own it.
  Answer choice E has the opposite flawed reasoning as it assumes that the only reason someone pays rent on a house is that they do not own it.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in answer choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument above states that no one at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  It then concludes that because Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument assumes that not receiving a raise means that one has received a poor performance evaluation.
  This is similar to the flawed reasoning in option E, which assumes that not owning a house means that one pays rent on it.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Therefore, it must be that they pay rent on it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument above concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he did not receive a raise.
  This is a flawed reasoning since there could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise.
  The argument assumes that receiving a poor performance evaluation is the only reason why someone would not receive a raise.
  Choice A has a similar flawed reasoning, where the argument assumes that paying rent is the only reason why someone would not own a house.
  The correct answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  Then, it concludes that Lester has received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise.
  This is flawed reasoning because not receiving a raise does not necessarily mean that someone has received a poor performance evaluation.
  Choice A has a similar flawed reasoning because not paying rent does not necessarily mean that someone owns the house.
  Choice B has a similar structure to the argument above but with a different premise and conclusion.
  Choice C has a different premise and conclusion.
  Choice D has a similar structure to the argument above but with a different premise and conclusion.
  Choice E has a different premise and conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Lester has received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise.
  The argument assumes that receiving a raise is the only way to avoid having a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument does not consider other reasons why someone might not receive a raise.
  The flawed reasoning in the argument is most similar to the reasoning in option B.
  Option B concludes that the neighbors do not pay rent because they own their house.
  Option B assumes that owning a house is the only way to avoid paying rent.
  The option does not consider other reasons why someone might not pay rent.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. 
  Then, it concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise.
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why Lester has not received a raise.
  Choice A is similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above because it assumes that paying rent is mutually exclusive with owning a house.
  Just like in the original argument, this assumption is flawed because it is possible for someone to both own a house and pay rent on it.
  Therefore, the answer is A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it. 
Action: Answer("A")

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A is correct because Joe made a legitimate offer and Sandy has not rejected the offer, so there was a valid contract.
  Option B is correct because Kenta accepted Gus's offer, but Gus made the offer in jest, so the contract was not valid.
  Option C is incorrect because the principle does not state that if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. It only talks about the legitimacy of the offer.
  Option D is correct because Hai's offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, so if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  Option E is incorrect because it talks about the legitimacy of the offer, not whether someone would reasonably believe it to be made in jest.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is only legitimate if it is not made in jest and someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe it to be legitimate.
  Option A talks about a legitimate offer and no rejection, but it does not mention anything about whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option B talks about an offer made in jest and thus, the contract is not valid. This aligns with the principle stated.
  Option C talks about a legitimate offer, but it also assumes that Mindy is a reasonable person and will accept the offer.
  Option D talks about an offer that was not made in jest and was reasonable to believe. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  Option E talks about an illegitimate offer and thus, there is no valid contract.
  The argument that aligns with the principle stated is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The principle stated above says that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The argument that best justifies this principle would be one that involves the legitimacy of an offer.
  Option A argues that Joe's offer to buy Sandy's car was legitimate and thus there was a valid contract.
  Option B argues that Gus made an offer in jest and thus the contract was not valid.
  Option C argues that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business was legitimate and thus if Mindy is reasonable, she will accept the offer.
  Option D argues that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest and thus if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  Option E argues that Sal's only offer to Veronica was not a legitimate one, and thus there is no valid contract between them.
  The argument that best justifies the principle stated in the question is option B, which argues that Gus made an offer in jest and thus the contract was not valid.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The principle states that a legitimate offer is required for a contract to be valid.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A talks about a legitimate offer and Sandy not rejecting it. However, it does not address whether the offer was made in jest.
  Option B talks about an offer made in jest, which makes it not legitimate.
  Option C talks about a legitimate offer and Mindy being a reasonable person. However, it does not address whether the offer was made in jest.
  Option D talks about an offer that was not made in jest and Lea accepting it.
  Option E talks about an offer that was not legitimate.
  Therefore, the principle stated above most helps to justify the reasoning in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The principle stated above says that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A says that there was a valid contract because Joe made a legitimate offer to Sandy and Sandy has not rejected the offer. This option does not consider if Sandy believed the offer to be made in jest.
  Option B says that the contract was not valid because Gus made the offer in jest and Kenta accepted it without knowing that. This option considers the principle stated above.
  Option C says that if Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate, Mindy should accept it if she is a reasonable person. This option does not consider if Mindy believed the offer to be made in jest.
  Option D says that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. This option considers the principle stated above.
  Option E says that there is no valid contract between Sal and Veronica because the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. This option does not consider if Veronica believed the offer to be made in jest.
  Therefore, the principle stated above most helps to justify the reasoning in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A only mentions that Joe made a legitimate offer to Sandy and Sandy has not rejected it. It does not address the principle stated above.
  Option B is consistent with the principle stated above. Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus made the offer in jest, so the contract was not valid.
  Option C only mentions that Frank's offer was legitimate and does not address the principle stated above.
  Option D mentions that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. This is consistent with the principle stated above.
  Option E mentions that the only offer Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. It does not address the principle stated above.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The principle stated above says that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The argument that justifies the principle is the one that uses it to show that a contract is valid or not.
  Choice A uses the principle to show that there was a valid contract.
  Choice B uses the principle to show that the contract was not valid.
  Choice C does not use the principle to show whether the contract is valid or not.
  Choice D uses the principle to show that if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  Choice E does not use the principle to show whether the contract is valid or not.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
The principle stated above says that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Option A talks about legitimate offer and its acceptance, but it doesn't mention anything about the offer being made in jest.
Option B talks about an offer being made in jest and hence not being valid. This aligns with the principle stated above.
Option C talks about a legitimate offer, but it doesn't mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
Option D talks about an offer being made in such a way that it wouldn't be believed to be made in jest. This aligns with the principle stated above.
Option E talks about a non-legitimate offer, but it doesn't mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
Therefore, the answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The principle stated above is about the validity of a contract based on the legitimacy of an offer.
  Option A mentions a legitimate offer and no rejection, which means there was a valid contract.
  Option B mentions an offer made in jest, which means the contract was not valid.
  Option C mentions a legitimate offer and a reasonable person accepting the offer, which is not directly related to the principle stated above.
  Option D mentions an offer that was not made in jest and a possible valid contract if accepted.
  Option E mentions a non-legitimate offer, which means there is no valid contract.
  Option B is the only one directly related to the principle stated above.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
The principle is about the validity of an offer and its acceptance in forming a contract.
Option A talks about a legitimate offer and its acceptance, so it may be valid.
Option B talks about an offer made in jest, which is not legitimate, so it may be invalid.
Option C talks about a legitimate offer and the expectation of acceptance, but it doesn't mention acceptance, so it's unclear.
Option D talks about a legitimate offer and its reasonable perception, which may be valid.
Option E talks about the non-existence of a legitimate offer, so it doesn't apply.
Therefore, the answer is either A or D.
Option A talks about the acceptance of a legitimate offer, which is valid.
Option D talks about the reasonable perception of a legitimate offer, which is also valid.
Thus, the answer is either A or D.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: When surveyed about which party they would like to see in the legislature, 40 percent of respondents said Conservative, 20 percent said Moderate, and 40 percent said Liberal. If the survey results are reliable, we can conclude that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses premises about the actual state of affairs to draw a conclusion about how matters should be.
  B: The argument draws a conclusion that merely restates a premise presented in favor of it.
  C: The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
  D: The argument fails to consider that the survey results might have been influenced by the political biases of the researchers who conducted the survey.
  E: The argument uses evidence that supports only rough estimates to draw a precisely quantified conclusion.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument assumes that the preferences of the group surveyed represent the preferences of the entire population.
  This assumption may not be accurate since the sample size is not mentioned.
  It is possible that the survey results are not reliable and are not representative of the population.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in using unreliable data to draw a conclusion.
  The answer is C: The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal based on a survey.
  The flaw in the argument is that it takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
  Just because 40 percent of respondents said Conservative, 20 percent said Moderate, and 40 percent said Liberal, it does not mean that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal based on the survey results.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal based on the survey results.
  However, the argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group, which is not necessarily true.
  Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it assumes the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that if survey results are reliable, most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal.
  The survey results show that 40 percent of respondents said Conservative, 20 percent said Moderate, and 40 percent said Liberal.
  The argument assumes that the preferences of the survey respondents are representative of the preferences of most citizens.
  This is a hasty generalization because the survey sample might not be representative of the population.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument uses survey results to draw a conclusion about the preferences of the citizens.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are reliable.
  The argument assumes that the sample of respondents is representative of the population.
  The argument assumes that the respondents' preferences are consistent with their actual voting behavior.
  Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that 40% of respondents said Conservative, 20% said Moderate, and 40% said Liberal.
  The argument concludes that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40% Conservative, 20% Moderate, and 40% Liberal.
  The argument assumes that the preferences of the respondents in the survey are representative of the entire population.

  Therefore, the most accurate flaw in the reasoning is C: The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that the citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40% Conservative, 20% Moderate, and 40% Liberal.
  The argument is based on the survey results.
  The survey results indicate that 40% of respondents said Conservative, 20% said Moderate, and 40% said Liberal.
  The argument assumes that the survey results represent the preferences of most citizens.
  However, the survey results may not be representative of the entire population.
  Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an answer that weakens this argument.
  Answer choice A doesn't address the issue of stretching.
  Answer choice B suggests that some joggers may have difficulty performing stretches, but it doesn't necessarily mean that stretching doesn't help to prevent injuries.
  Answer choice C suggests that most jogging injuries result from mishaps that stretching cannot prevent, but it doesn't address whether stretching can prevent other types of injuries.
  Answer choice D suggests that joggers who are more prone to injuries are more likely to stretch, but it doesn't address whether stretching actually prevents injuries.
  Answer choice E suggests that stretching can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise, which weakens the argument that stretching doesn't help to prevent injuries.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this argument.
  Option E states that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
  This contradicts the researcher's argument.
  Therefore, E is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  If stretching before jogging has some effect on preventing injuries, then it will weaken the argument.
  Option E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from exercise.
  This implies that stretching may not prevent injuries but can help to reduce the severity of injuries.
  Therefore, option E weakens the medical researcher's argument.

Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that suggests stretching before jogging does help to prevent injuries.
  Option E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
  Therefore, option E weakens the medical researcher's argument the most.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries because both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the researcher's conclusion or provides alternate reasoning for the same outcome.
  Option A does not weaken the argument as it just provides additional information.
  Option B is out of scope as it talks about the difficulty of performing stretches and not their effectiveness in preventing injuries.
  Option C supports the argument that stretching does not prevent injuries.
  Option D is also out of scope as it talks about the habit of performing stretches and not their effectiveness in preventing injuries.
  Option E contradicts the researcher's conclusion by stating that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from exercise.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens the argument.
  Option A suggests that the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries. This means that both groups of joggers compared by the scientists had fewer injuries than expected. This weakens the argument of the medical researcher by indicating that stretching may have helped reduce injuries.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C suggests that stretching would have little effect on injuries caused by falls, collisions, and other mishaps. This is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D suggests that joggers who are more prone to jogging injuries are more likely to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging. This does not weaken the argument.
  Option E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise. This is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the researcher's conclusion.
  Option A suggests that the rate of jogging injuries was lower for both groups of joggers compared to the overall rate of jogging injuries, which supports the idea that stretching before jogging may help prevent injuries.
  Option B is not relevant to the researcher's argument.
  Option C suggests that most jogging injuries have little to do with flexibility, which does not contradict the researcher's conclusion.
  Option D does not contradict the researcher's conclusion.
  Option E is not relevant to the researcher's argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken this argument, we need to show that stretching before jogging might help to prevent injuries.
  Choice A does not address the issue of whether stretching before jogging helps to prevent injuries.
  Choice B suggests that some joggers may have difficulty performing stretches, but it does not address the issue of whether stretching before jogging helps to prevent injuries.
  Choice C suggests that most jogging injuries result from mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little effect. This weakens the argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  Choice D suggests that joggers who are more prone to injuries are more likely to stretch before jogging. This does not address the issue of whether stretching before jogging helps to prevent injuries.
  Choice E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise. This does not address the issue of whether stretching before jogging helps to prevent injuries.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  However, the advertisement only tested five different colas.
  There could be other colas that were not tested that may elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  The answer is C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument above presents a conditional statement.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds.
  The argument's flaw is that it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is because of squirrels.
  The argument ignores the possibility that there may be other reasons why a bird feeder will not attract many birds.
  Choice E presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning, as it also assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds.
  The argument fails to consider whether a bird feeder with a protective cover will attract many birds.
  Answer choice A presents a similar pattern of reasoning where the argument concludes that checking tire pressure regularly will prevent tires from wearing out prematurely, but fails to consider other factors that may cause tires to wear out prematurely.
  Therefore, the answer is A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument above is saying that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  This is because squirrels will eat from the bird feeder if it lacks a protective cover, and squirrels will scare away the birds.
  However, the argument fails to consider the possibility that the bird feeder might not attract many birds even if it has a protective cover.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning is that it assumes that a single factor (lack of protective cover) is the only reason why a bird feeder might not attract many birds.
  Choice C has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that car owners will always check their tire pressure regularly.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument above is based on the conditional statement: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds.
  The argument also states that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The conclusion is that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The flaw in the argument is that it assumes that the presence of a protective cover will prevent squirrels from eating from the bird feeder. However, this may not be true in all cases.
  Option B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning where it assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is due to low tire pressure, neglecting other possible reasons.
  Therefore, the answer is B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The premise is that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is because of squirrels eating from it.
  The correct answer should have a similar flaw in reasoning.
  Choice A is not similar because it does not have a flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Choice B is similar because it assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is if the car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly.
  Choice C is not similar because it does not have a flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Choice D is similar because it assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is if the car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly.
  Choice E is not similar because it does not have a flawed pattern of reasoning.
  The answer is either B or D, but D is a better fit because it has the same structure as the original argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover, based on the premise that squirrels eat from the bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The flaw in the argument is that it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder would not attract many birds is because of squirrels eating from it.
  The argument is most similar to answer choice D, which assumes that the only reason a tire would wear out prematurely is because the car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement in the first sentence.
  It then presents another conditional statement that is only true if the first conditional statement is true.
  The conclusion is based on the second conditional statement only.
  So, the flawed pattern of reasoning is ignoring the possibility of other factors that could affect the conclusion.
  Choice E presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning by ignoring the possibility of other factors affecting the conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument above uses conditional statements.
  The conclusion is based on a conditional statement that is not supported by the premises.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds, but the premises do not support this conclusion.
  The argument is flawed because it makes an unwarranted assumption.
  Answer choice B is similar to the argument above in that it concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, but the premises do not support this conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  It assumes squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  It also assumes that if squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds.
  The argument commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent.
  The argument's pattern of reasoning is most similar to that in answer choice D.
  Answer choice D also commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The argument is flawed because the conclusion is too strong and overgeneralizes the evidence.
  The argument ignores other factors that can affect the number of birds that a bird feeder attracts.
  Choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.
  It presents a conditional statement.
  It concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  The argument ignores other factors that can affect tire wear.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to identify an option that suggests that the amount of television watched is not the only factor that leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  Option A does not weaken the argument since it talks about people overestimating the risks regardless of the amount of TV they watch.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument since it talks about the likelihood of living in an area prone to natural disasters.
  Option C strengthens the argument by stating that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  Option D weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument since it talks about the likelihood of watching an above-average amount of television based on where the person lives.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that watching too much television leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  Weakening the argument would involve showing that television viewing is not the cause of overestimation of risks, or that the conclusion is not warranted.
  Choice A is irrelevant, as it does not directly address the issue of television viewing. It is too broad to be effective.
  Choice B is irrelevant, as it only talks about the likelihood of living in an area prone to natural disasters and does not address the issue of television viewing.
  Choice C is a strong contender, as it suggests that people who watch less television have a better idea of the likelihood of natural disasters. This would weaken the idea that watching television is the cause of overestimation of risks.
  Choice D is also a strong contender, as it suggests that there are other ways to become well informed about natural disasters that do not involve watching television. This would weaken the idea that television viewing is the cause of overestimation of risks.
  Choice E is irrelevant, as it only talks about the likelihood of watching television in areas prone to natural disasters and does not address the issue of overestimation of risks.
  Both choice C and D weaken the argument, but choice D is stronger as it directly challenges the conclusion that television viewing causes overestimation of risks.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than if they do not watch an above-average amount of television.
  We need to find an option that weakens this claim.
  Option A is not helpful in this regard because it suggests that regardless of the amount of television people watch, they overestimate the dangers of the world.
  Option B is also irrelevant because it only talks about the likelihood of living in an area prone to natural disasters and does not address the issue of watching television.
  Option C actually strengthens the argument by saying that people who watch less television tend to have an accurate idea of the risks of natural disasters.
  Option D weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well informed about natural disasters tend to be informed in ways other than watching television.
  Option E is irrelevant because it only talks about the likelihood of watching above-average television in areas prone to natural disasters.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This suggests that watching television may not be the only factor in people's perceptions of the risks of natural disasters.
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think they will be victims of natural disasters.
  To weaken this reasoning, we need to find an option that suggests that television viewing is not the cause of people's overestimation of the risk of natural disasters.
  Option A doesn't address the influence of television on people's risk assessment.
  Option B doesn't provide any information that weakens the reasoning above.
  Option C supports the argument by saying that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  Option D suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  Option E doesn't address the influence of television on people's risk assessment.
  Option D weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well informed about natural disasters tend to become informed in some way other than by watching television. This weakens the argument that watching an above-average amount of television leads to overestimation of the risks of natural disasters.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument by showing that watching television is not the cause of overestimating risks.
  Option A doesn't address the impact of watching television.
  Option B suggests that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, which is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C suggests that people who watch less television are more accurate in estimating the risks. This statement supports the reasoning in the argument.
  Option D suggests that people who are well informed about natural disasters don't rely on television for information, which weakens the argument.
  Option E suggests that people living in areas prone to natural disasters watch more television, which doesn't address the impact of television on people's perception of risks.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This statement suggests that television is not the only source of information about natural disasters.
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The reasoning suggests that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The question asks for the choice that weakens the reasoning above.
  If many people regardless of the amount of television they watch overestimate the dangers of the world, it does not weaken the reasoning that watching too much television can lead to overestimating risks.
  If people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters, it does not weaken the reasoning that watching too much television can lead to overestimating risks.
  If people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster, it strengthens the reasoning that watching too much television can lead to overestimating risks.
  If people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, it weakens the reasoning that watching too much television can lead to overestimating risks.
  If a person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters, it does not weaken the reasoning that watching too much television can lead to overestimating risks.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The argument provides evidence that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of natural disasters.
  We need to find an option that weakens the conclusion that watching too much television leads to overestimation of risks.
  Option A does not weaken the argument, as it suggests that many people overestimate the dangers regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  Option B is irrelevant, as it talks about the likelihood of living in an area prone to natural disasters.
  Option C strengthens the argument by suggesting that people who watch a below-average amount of television have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of natural disasters.
  Option D weakens the argument by suggesting that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  Option E is irrelevant, as it talks about the likelihood of watching television and living in an area prone to natural disasters.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television causes people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find a statement that weakens this claim.
  If we can find evidence that watching television is not the only factor causing people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters, then the argument is weakened.
  Option A does not address the relationship between television watching and overestimating risks.
  Option B suggests that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters. It does not address the relationship between television watching and overestimating risks.
  Option C suggests that people who watch less television have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of natural disasters. This weakens the argument that watching too much television causes people to overestimate risks.
  Option D suggests that people who are well informed have gained that knowledge through means other than television. This weakens the argument that watching too much television causes people to overestimate risks.
  Option E suggests that people who live in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch more television. It does not address the relationship between television watching and overestimating risks.
  Therefore, the answer is C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that the more television people watch, the more likely they are to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  To weaken this, we need to find an answer choice that suggests television viewing is not the cause of overestimating natural disaster risks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant and doesn't impact the conclusion.
  Choice C, if true, strengthens the argument.
  Choice D suggests that there may be other sources of information that people use to become well informed. This weakens the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that watching too much TV can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that watching TV is not the main cause of overestimation.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the role of TV watching in overestimating risks.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument that watching below-average TV leads to more accurate perception of natural disasters, so it does not weaken the argument.
  Choice D supports the argument that TV watching is the main cause of overestimating risks, so it does not weaken the argument.
  Choice E suggests that living in an area prone to natural disasters is the main cause of watching above-average TV, not the other way around.
  Therefore, choice E weakens the argument.

Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself

  The argument does not explain how the chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun, but the study concluded that chameleons do bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  The argument does not generalize the behavior of chameleons to lizards as a whole, but the study concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  The argument does not focus its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself, but it does use the author's professional reputation to support the study's results.
  The argument does not fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise.
  The argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the study's author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years, so the study's results should not be doubted.

  The biologist argues that the study's conclusion is valid despite the small sample size.
  The biologist supports the study's author's expertise to defend the study's conclusion.
  The argument does not generalize the behavior of chameleons to all lizards.
  The argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production.
  The argument does not focus on the author rather than the study itself.
  The argument does not fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise.
  However, the argument may be vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
The biologist's argument tries to make a case that the study's result is reliable, despite the small sample size.
The biologist argues that the study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
However, the argument does not address some of the criticisms of the study, such as its small sample size.
Also, the argument could be improved by providing more details about the study's methodology and findings.
The argument is not vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole, as the study focuses explicitly on chameleons.
The argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
The argument does not focus its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself, as it mentions the study's findings.
The argument does not fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise.
The argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
Therefore, the best answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results because the author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  The argument does not address the critics' concerns that the sample size was very small and that the behavior of chameleons may not be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
  The answer is E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument concludes that the critics of the study are wrong to doubt its results.
  The argument provides two premises to support this conclusion: the careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D, and the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  However, the argument does not address the criticism that the sample size was very small, which is a significant limitation of the study.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to consider the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  The answer is not A, B, C, D, or E.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The biologist concluded that lizards bask in the sun to regulate vitamin D production based on a study of six individual chameleons.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals must be due to increased profitability.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer that suggests an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
  Option A suggests that the increase in subscription rates is being passed on to library users, rather than indicating increased profitability.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C supports the argument.
  Option D weakens the argument by suggesting that libraries are not the primary subscribers and that the subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates indicates that publishing scholarly journals is now much more profitable than it was several years ago.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument.
  Option B is also not relevant to the argument.
  Option C strengthens the argument.
  Option D is also not relevant to the argument.
  Option E doesn't weaken the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant, but the subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically.
  The argument further assumes that the increase in subscription rates is due to increased profitability.
  To weaken the argument, we need to provide an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
  Option D provides an alternative explanation by stating that most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  This suggests that libraries may be paying more for subscriptions because they are buying more subscriptions, not because publishers are increasing prices.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
The argument is that the significant increase in subscription rates of scholarly journals indicates that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago. In order to weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this claim.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is also irrelevant to the argument.
Option C actually supports the argument.
Option D contradicts the argument by indicating that subscription rates for individuals have not increased.
Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that the costs of publishing scholarly journals have remained constant, yet the subscription rates have increased, so publishing must be more profitable now than it was before.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that shows that the conclusion is not necessarily true, or that there is another explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
  Choice A talks about passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users, but this does not address the argument.
  Choice B is irrelevant.
  Choice C supports the argument.
  Choice D suggests that libraries are not the main subscribers, so it is possible that subscription rates for libraries have increased, while individual rates have remained constant.
  Choice E is irrelevant.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that the increase in the subscription rate for scholarly journals is not justified because the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant.
  The argument concludes that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the conclusion that publishing a scholarly journal is much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  Choice (C) contradicts the conclusion of the argument by stating that publishers of scholarly journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:

  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B does not address the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
  Option C supports the argument by stating that publishing a scholarly journal is expensive.
  Option D suggests that subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years, which weakens the argument by indicating that the increase in subscription rates is not due to profitability but rather due to libraries paying more.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument suggests that the implementation of the plan to systematically record all staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries. 
To strengthen the argument, we need to find evidence that supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the plan.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about a policy that existed before the plan was implemented.
Option B is also irrelevant as it talks about a different hospital that did not participate in the plan.
Option C weakens the argument as it suggests that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
Option D strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in the incidence of the injuries occurred only after the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Option E is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument states that recording all staff errors made the staff more meticulous and reduced the incidence of patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need a statement that supports this causal relationship.
  Option B talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan, so it is irrelevant.
  Option C weakens the argument by pointing out that some staff errors were not recorded.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option A does not support the causal relationship between recording errors and reducing patient injuries.
  Option D supports the causal relationship by stating that the decrease in injuries began only when staff became aware of the close analysis of records.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The plan implemented to record all staff errors resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
  The reason for the decrease is that staff became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties due to the knowledge that their errors were being monitored.
  The correct answer will strengthen the argument that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the plan implemented.
  Answer A provides information about a policy that already existed before the plan was implemented. This does not explain the decrease in patient injuries.
  Answer B provides information about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan. This does not strengthen the argument that the plan implemented resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
  Answer C provides information about staff errors that were not recorded under the plan. This does not strengthen the argument that the plan implemented resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
  Answer D strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was a result of the knowledge that the records were being closely analyzed.
  Answer E does not strengthen the argument that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the plan implemented. 
Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that the implementation of the plan to systematically record staff errors resulted in a substantial decrease in patient injuries caused by staff errors.
  The correct choice should show a causal relationship between the implementation of the plan and the decrease in patient injuries.
  Choice A is about a policy that was already in place before the implementation of the plan and doesn't relate to the argument.
  Choice B talks about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan, so it does not relate to the argument.
  Choice C shows a limitation of the plan, but it doesn't strengthen the argument.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D shows a causal relationship between the implementation of the plan and the decrease in patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that the incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased since the implementation of the plan to systematically record all staff errors.
  The reason for the decrease is that the staff became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties due to the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find the answer choice that supports the idea that the decrease in injuries is due to the staff's increased caution.
  Choice B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it talks about errors that were not recorded, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice A could be a contender, but it talks about investigating life-threatening injuries, not all staff errors.
  Choice D supports the idea that the staff's increased caution is responsible for the decrease in injuries because it states that the decrease did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the systematic recording of staff errors has made the hospitals' staffs more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties, which caused the incidence of patient injuries to decrease.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find a choice that supports the idea that the systematic recording of staff errors is the main reason for the decrease in patient injuries.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it talks about a policy that was in place before the plan.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about a different hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Choice C weakens the argument by suggesting that some staff errors were not recorded.
  Choice D supports the argument by stating that the decrease in patient injuries did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is that the hospitals' staffs became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties because their errors were being carefully monitored.

  A, C, and E weaken the argument.
  B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  The only answer that strengthens the argument is D because it states that the decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to record staff errors resulted in a decrease in the number of patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that confirms the relationship between the decrease in patient injuries and the plan to record staff errors.
  Option A does not provide any new information to support the argument.
  Option B is irrelevant because it refers to a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option D strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was a direct result of the staff's awareness of the records being closely analyzed.
  Option E is irrelevant because it refers to the consequences of making staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that the systematic recording of staff errors decreased the incidence of patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries was indeed due to the systematic recording of staff errors.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a policy that was already in place before the implementation of the plan.
  Choice B is not relevant because it talks about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Choice C weakens the argument because it implies that the plan was not comprehensive in recording all staff errors.
  Choice D strengthens the argument because it shows that the decrease in patient injuries was not due to chance but due to the staff's awareness of the monitoring.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the reason for the decrease in patient injuries.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
The argument states that the implementation of a plan to systematically record staff errors has resulted in a substantial decrease in patient injuries. 
To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the implementation of the plan.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is not relevant to the argument as it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
Option C weakens the argument by stating that not all staff errors were recorded.
Option D strengthens the argument by stating that the decrease in patient injuries began only after the staff was aware that their errors were being monitored.
Option E is not relevant to the argument as it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps, to explain the increase in average commute time?
Choices:
  A: Most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs.
  B: The location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs.
  C: Shortly after the new highway was opened, several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights.
  D: At the same time the new highway was being built,. road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner.
  E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The new highway was built to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  We need to find an answer that explains why the new highway led to an increase in the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner.
  Answer choice A is already given in the context and does not explain why the new highway led to an increase in the average commute time.
  Answer choice B suggests that the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs, but it does not explain why the new highway led to an increase in the average commute time.
  Answer choice C suggests that several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights. This could cause traffic congestion and explain why the new highway led to an increase in the average commute time.
  Answer choice D suggests that at the same time the new highway was being built, road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner. This could cause traffic congestion and explain why the new highway led to an increase in the average commute time.
  Answer choice E suggests that traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened. This could explain why the new highway led to an increase in the average commute time.
  Answer choice C, D, and E explain why the new highway led to an increase in the average commute time, but answer choice E is the most specific and directly related to the new highway.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The new highway was built to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  The question asks to explain the increase in average commute time.
  If the roads leading to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights, it could have caused a delay in commute time.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Shortly after the new highway was opened, several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The city built a new highway to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  We need to find an option that explains why the average commute time increased even after building a highway to relieve traffic congestion.
  Option A is not helpful as it only states that most people commute from one of the city's suburbs.
  Option B is also not helpful as it only states that the location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs.
  Option C is not helpful as it only talks about suburban roads upgrading with new stoplights.
  Option D is also not helpful as it only mentions road repair work being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner.
  Option E is the most helpful as it states that traffic in the downtown area became more congested after the new highway was opened. This suggests that the increase in traffic in the downtown area is the reason for the increase in the average commute time.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The new highway was built to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  Therefore, there must be some other factors that affected the traffic in downtown Gastner.
  Option A is irrelevant to the issue of traffic congestion.
  Option B is also irrelevant because it only talks about the convenience of the highway for people in the largest suburbs, but it doesn't explain the increase in commute time for workers in downtown Gastner.
  Option C may contribute to the traffic congestion, but it doesn't explain why the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased.
  Option D is a plausible explanation for the increase in commute time for workers in downtown Gastner because road repair work may have caused congestion in the downtown area.
  Option E suggests that the new highway caused more traffic congestion in the downtown area, which is a plausible explanation for the increase in commute time.
  Option E seems to be the better explanation because it directly addresses the issue of traffic congestion in the downtown area.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The city built a new highway to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  We need to find an option that explains the increase in average commute time.
  Option A and B do not explain why the average commute time increased.
  Option C may cause traffic congestion, but it does not explain why the average commute time increased.
  Option D may cause traffic congestion, but it does not explain why the average commute time increased.
  Option E is most likely to explain the situation, as it suggests that the new highway caused more traffic congestion in the downtown area.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The city of Gastner built a new highway to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the highway opened.
  We need to find a statement that best explains why the average commute time increased.
  Option A is not helpful because it only tells us that most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs, but it doesn't explain why the average commute time increased.
  Option B is not helpful because it only tells us that the location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs, but it doesn't explain why the average commute time increased.
  Option C is not helpful because it only tells us that several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights, but it doesn't explain why the average commute time increased.
  Option D is not helpful because it only tells us that at the same time the new highway was being built, road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner, but it doesn't explain why the average commute time increased.
  Option E is helpful because it tells us that traffic on the roads near the new highway became more congested after the new highway was opened. This congestion could have caused longer commute times for workers in downtown Gastner.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The new highway linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area was built to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  To explain the increase in average commute time, we need to find an option that shows why the new highway led to an increase in average commute time.
  If the new highway is more convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs, then it is possible that the new highway attracted more vehicles and caused more congestion.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is about imposing a penalty for a pollution offense.
  The argument requires stronger evidence or admission of guilt to impose the penalty.
  The argument implies that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  Therefore, the argument is based on the principle that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is about the justification for imposing a severe penalty for pollution.
  The argument claims that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, they cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  The argument is suggesting that the severity of the penalty requires a higher level of certainty of guilt.
  Option A says that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  This principle supports the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument is that the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter without stronger evidence or a confession.
  Therefore, the principle that most helps justify the reasoning in the argument would be one that supports the idea that a penalty should not be imposed unless guilt is certain or there is strong evidence.
  Choice A supports this idea, stating that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is about the severity of the penalty for an infraction and the need for stronger evidence or admission of responsibility before imposing the penalty.
  Choice A states that the more severe the penalty is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of the party before imposing the penalty.
  This principle is directly related to the argument, as it justifies the need for stronger evidence or admission of responsibility before imposing the penalty.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument is discussing the imposition of a penalty for an environmental infraction.
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of infraction is severe.
  The argument also states that the identity of the polluter cannot be sufficiently certain to justify imposing the penalty.
  The argument suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is necessary before imposing the penalty.
  The principle that best justifies the reasoning in the argument is that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, they cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  Answer choice A states that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party, which aligns with the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice B discusses the severity of penalties, but does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  Answer choice C discusses the proportionality of penalties to harm caused, but does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  Answer choice D discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility, but does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  Answer choice E discusses the severity of penalties and certainty of guilt, which aligns with the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice A and E are both relevant to the argument's reasoning, but answer choice A is a more direct match.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is discussing the justification for imposing a penalty on the polluter.
  The argument suggests that the penalty is too severe to be imposed without stronger evidence or a confession.
  The argument is based on the uncertainty of the identity of the polluter.
  The principle that would most help to justify the reasoning in the argument is one that relates to the severity of the penalty and the certainty of the guilt.
  Option A fits this description.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument is about the justification for imposing a penalty for pollution.
  The argument suggests that the penalty for pollution is severe.
  The argument also suggests that stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
  The principle that most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument is the one that relates to the severity of the penalty and the certainty of guilt.
  Option A states that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing the penalty.
  This principle supports the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument talks about the severity of the penalty for pollution.
  The argument also states that without stronger evidence or admission of responsibility, the penalty cannot be imposed.
  Therefore, the principle that justifies the argument is that the severity of the penalty for an infraction should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
  The answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also states that the evidence is not sufficient to justify imposing the penalty.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the argument depends on a principle that supports the idea that a penalty should not be imposed unless guilt is certain.
  The principle that supports this idea is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.

Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The columnist thinks that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The legislator proposed not building the dam but instead using the extra money to build new roads.
  The columnist thinks that the extra money should be used to build the dam.
  The principle that justifies the columnist's judgment is that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The columnist is arguing against using the extra money collected from water bills to build new roads.
  The legislator's proposal is to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist thinks that the proposal is unacceptable.
  The principle that would justify the columnist's judgment would be one that supports the use of the extra money to build a dam.
  Choice B states that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  Building a dam would benefit the entire community by providing a water source, while building new roads would only benefit some members of the community.
  Therefore, the principle in choice B most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills to build a dam.
  The member of the legislature has proposed using the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building the dam.
  The columnist thinks that proposal is unacceptable.
  To justify the columnist's judgment, we need to find a principle that supports that the money collected from water bills should be used for water-related expenditures.
  Option E states that a water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
  Option E supports the idea that the money collected from water bills should be used for water-related expenditures.
  Therefore, Option E is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that the legislator's proposal to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads is unacceptable.
  The proposal seems to suggest that the money should be spent on one thing rather than another.
  Therefore, the most helpful principle to justify the columnist's judgment is the one that relates to the use of money for different purposes.
  Choice B states that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  This principle implies that the money collected from water bills should be used for water-related projects, such as building a dam, rather than for building roads.
  Therefore, B is the best answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The columnist is arguing that building roads with money designated to build a dam is not acceptable.
  The legislator's proposal is to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The principle that would help justify the columnist's judgment is that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  Building a dam benefits the entire community by providing a reliable water source, while building new roads benefits only some members of the community.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The columnist is arguing that the legislator's proposal to spend the extra money on new roads instead of building a dam is unacceptable.
  The justification for this judgment must relate to principles that support building the dam.
  The project seems to be related to water, as an additional charge on water bills is being used to fund it.
  Therefore, the valid principle that most helps justify the columnist's judgment is that an additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The columnist believes that the proposal to use extra money from water bills to build roads is unacceptable.
  This implies that the columnist believes that the extra money should be used for water-related expenditures.
  Answer choice E states that a water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
  This principle most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The columnist is arguing that the extra money collected from water bills should be used to build the dam, which is a water-related expenditure. 
  The legislator is proposing to use the extra money to build new roads, which is not water-related. 
  The columnist believes that it is unacceptable to use the extra money for non-water related projects.
  Choice B most helps to justify the columnist's judgment because it argues that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The columnist's judgment is that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The legislator's proposal is to spend the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist thinks that spending the extra money on new roads is not justified.
  To justify the judgment, we need to find a principle that supports the idea that the money should be used for the dam and not for the roads.
  Choice B seems to be the best option because it suggests that money designated for projects that benefit the entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of the community. Building a dam benefits the entire community by providing a source of water, while building new roads does not.
Action: Answer("B")

Context: Professor: The most important function of epic poetry is to transmit the values by which a group of people is to live. This transmission is accomplished not by an explicit discussion of those values, but rather by their embodiment in heroic figures, who are presented as role models. Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
Question: If the professor's statements are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: An important function of poetry is to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it.
  B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  C: When values are represented in poetry, they are rarely if ever set forth explicitly.
  D: For many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
  E: Only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models that, if imitated, give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear it.

  So, if the professor's statements are true, which one of the following must also be true?
  A: An important function of poetry is to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it. - This is not necessarily true based on the professor's statements. The professor is only talking about epic poetry and not all types of poetry.
  B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models. - This is true based on the professor's statements.
  C: When values are represented in poetry, they are rarely if ever set forth explicitly. - This is not necessarily true based on the professor's statements. The professor only talks about epic poetry and not all types of poetry.
  D: For many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live. - This is true based on the professor's statements.
  E: Only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models that, if imitated, give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear it. - This is not necessarily true based on the professor's statements. The professor is only talking about the most important function of epic poetry.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
The professor's statements suggest that epic poetry transmits values by embodying them in heroic figures and presenting them as role models.
If this is true, then it must also be true that epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
Therefore, the answer is B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The professor's statement is about the most important function of epic poetry.
  According to the professor, the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit the values by which a group of people is to live.
  This transmission is accomplished by presenting heroic figures as role models, not by explicitly discussing those values.
  The professor's statements imply that heroic figures are important for giving meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear epic poems.
  Therefore, the statement that must also be true is that epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  The answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  The professor also argues that imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  If the professor's statements are true, then the statement that must also be true is one that aligns with the professor's argument.
  Statement B is true because it accurately reflects the professor's argument that the most important function of epic poetry is to present heroic figures as role models to transmit values.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  From the argument, it can be inferred that epic poetry accomplishes its most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  Similarly, it can be inferred that heroic figures embody the values by which a group of people is to live.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: For many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The professor argues that epic poetry is a way to transmit values by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  The question asks which statement must also be true based on the professor's argument.
  Choice A is somewhat similar to the argument of the professor, but it is not a must-be-true statement.
  Choice B is a restatement of the professor's argument and must be true.
  Choice C is a possible implication of the professor's argument, but it is not a must-be-true statement.
  Choice D is consistent with the professor's argument and must be true.
  Choice E is not true because it uses the word "Only," which is too strong.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by embodying them in heroic figures.
  The professor also argues that imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  Therefore, the correct answer must reflect these arguments.
  Answer choice A is too broad and generalizes all poetry, which is not supported by the argument.
  Answer choice B accurately reflects the professor's argument that epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  Answer choice C is too extreme and uses the word "rarely if ever," which is not supported by the argument.
  Answer choice D is consistent with the argument that heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
  Answer choice E is too extreme and uses the word "only," which is not supported by the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The professor's statements focus on the most important function of epic poetry.
  According to the professor, epic poetry accomplishes this function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  These role models embody the values by which a group of people is to live.
  The professor does not make a claim that this is the only function of poetry.
  Therefore, A and E are incorrect.
  Also, the professor does not make a claim that values are rarely if ever set forth explicitly.
  Therefore, C is incorrect.
  The professor's statements lead to the conclusion that for many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
  Therefore, D is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values through heroic figures as role models. 
Choice A is too general and not specifically related to the topic of the function of epic poetry.
Choice C is too extreme and uses the word "rarely," which is not supported by the professor's statement.
Choice E is incorrect because it uses the word "only," which is not supported by the professor's statement.
Choice B aligns with the professor's statement that epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
Choice D aligns with the professor's statement that heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
Therefore, either choice B or D could be true based on the professor's statements.
Action: Answer("B") or Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The professor argues that epic poetry's most important function is to transmit values through heroic figures as role models.
  This suggests that epic poetry is meant to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it.
  The professor also states that this transmission of values is not done explicitly but rather through the embodiment of those values in the heroic figures.
  If this is the case, then it is likely that many groups of people use heroic figures as role models for the values they should embody.
  Therefore, B and D seem to be the most likely answers.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument in the advertisement is that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is based on a survey of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  The argument assumes that these policyholders are representative of all people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if it overlooks other possible factors.
  Option A raises the possibility that some people might have saved little or no money.
  Option B assumes that new policyholders pay more for their auto insurance on average than those who have held policies for a longer period of time.
  Option C argues that other insurance companies might offer even better savings than Popelka.
  Option D assumes that the savings reported by the policyholders are accurate.
  Option E suggests that the sample used in the survey might not be representative of the general population.
  Option C is a stronger criticism than the others because it suggests that there might be other insurance companies that offer even better savings than Popelka.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument in the advertisement is that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka because a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average. 
  This argument could be criticized on the basis that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.

  The advertisement provides evidence from a recent survey of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders who reported savings of $250 a year, on average.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if the survey results are not representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  Choice A states that the survey may have overlooked policyholders who saved little or no money by switching to Popelka.
  This criticism attacks the representativeness of the survey results.
  Therefore, the answer is A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
The argument in the advertisement can be criticized on the following grounds:
- It is possible that some of the new policyholders did not save any money or saved less than $250 on average.
- The advertisement assumes that the new policyholders pay the same amount as those who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer time.
- The advertisement fails to consider that other insurance companies may offer better savings than Popelka.
- It may be possible that the surveyed policyholders are not representative of all policyholders.
- The advertisement does not address the possibility that the new policyholders may have saved money due to factors other than switching to Popelka.
Among the given choices, option C is the most valid criticism as it points out the possibility of other insurance companies offering even more savings than Popelka. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:

  The argument is that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is based on a survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders who reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if the survey is not representative or if there are other factors that were not considered.
  Choice A suggests that the survey may not be representative if some new policyholders saved little or no money when they switched to Popelka.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument made in the advertisement.
  Choice C suggests that there may be other insurance companies that offer even greater savings than Popelka, but this does not necessarily undermine the argument that most people could save money by switching to Popelka.
  Choice D suggests that the survey may not be accurate if some policyholders underestimated their savings, but this is not a strong criticism of the argument made in the advertisement.
  Choice E suggests that the sample of new policyholders may not be representative if people capable of saving hundreds of dollars are disproportionately represented. This is a potential criticism of the argument made in the advertisement.
  Therefore, the answer is E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high.
  The reason is that the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  To support this position, we need to find an option which provides evidence that natural defenses prevent bilirubin from entering the brain.
  Option B goes against the position of the second group of doctors.
  Option A, C, D and E are not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The second group of doctors argues that the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  We need to find a statement that supports this argument.
  If some diseases can weaken the brain's natural defenses, then bilirubin may be able to enter the brain.
  Therefore, B is the most helpful statement for the second group of doctors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
To support the second group of doctors' position, we need to find a statement that shows the effectiveness of the brain's natural defenses.
Option B states that some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
This weakens the second group of doctors' position and supports the first group of doctors.
Option D is not related to the effectiveness of the brain's natural defenses.
Option A and E are not related to the argument.
Option C is about where bilirubin occurs in newborns, but it does not have any impact on the argument.
Therefore, the answer is B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argue for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  We need to find an option that supports this argument.
  Option B suggests that some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, which means the second group of doctors' argument is valid.
  Therefore, the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high because the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering. To support this position we need an option that shows the effectiveness of the brain's natural defense mechanism. 
Option B provides a reason why the natural defense mechanism may not work and bilirubin can enter the brain. This helps to support the position of the second group of doctors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
We need to find which option supports this argument.
Option A is not relevant to the argument.
Option B supports the argument by saying that some diseases weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
Option C is not relevant to the argument.
Option D says that bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth, but this doesn't support the second group's argument.
Option E is not relevant to the argument.
Therefore, the answer is B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  We need to find an option that supports the second group's argument.
  If some diseases can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, then the second group's argument that bilirubin levels should be allowed to remain high makes sense, since some newborns may not have strong natural defenses against bilirubin.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high since the brain's natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
To support the second group of doctors, we need to find a statement that indicates that the brain's natural defenses are effective in preventing bilirubin from entering.
Option B states that some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, which implies that the natural defenses are usually strong enough to prevent bilirubin from entering. Hence, Option B supports the position of the second group of doctors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
We need to find an option that supports this argument.
Option A does not support it because it talks about the treatment that reduces bilirubin levels in newborns.
Option B supports the argument because it says some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
Option D is also irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the positive effects of bilirubin.
Option E is also irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the general agreement among doctors regarding bilirubin levels.
Therefore, the answer is B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that Group A remembered to make the telephone call better than Group B, indicating that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  To establish that the conclusion is properly drawn, we need to find a statement that does not support the conclusion.
  If a statement does not help establish the conclusion, then it is a weakener.
  The conclusion is that Group A has better memory than Group B.
  Therefore, if a statement weakens the claim that Group A has better memory, then it is the answer.
  Choice A is not helpful, as it states that there was the same number of people in each group, which does not affect the conclusion.
  Choice B is not helpful, as it states that the same group of researchers answered the calls for both groups, which does not affect the conclusion.
  Choice C is not helpful, as it states that among the college students, there were no persons more than forty years old, which does not affect the conclusion.
  Choice D is not helpful, as it states that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which does not affect the conclusion.
  Choice E, however, weakens the conclusion, as it suggests that there might be a time gap between the instructions received by the two groups, which could have affected their ability to remember the time to make the call.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence provided is that Group A had only one lapse while Group B had fourteen lapses.
  We need to find which statement does not help to establish the conclusion properly.
  Option A is helpful because it ensures that the group size is not a factor in the results.
  Option B is helpful because it ensures that the same researchers answered the calls in both groups and there is no bias in the results.
  Option C is helpful because it ensures that there is no age bias in Group B.
  Option D is helpful because it ensures that both groups had equal access to the technology required for the task.
  Option E is helpful because it ensures that the time given to both groups to make the calls was not a factor in the results.
  Therefore, all options are helpful in establishing the conclusion properly.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B (composed of college students). 
  To establish the conclusion, we need the most helpful information.
  If one of the answer choices is least helpful in establishing the conclusion, then it weakens the conclusion.
  Answer choice A is not helpful because the size of each group does not affect the conclusion.
  Answer choice B is helpful because it ensures that the same conditions were present for both groups.
  Answer choice C is helpful because it ensures that there were no people in Group B that could be considered older adults.
  Answer choice D is helpful because it ensures that both groups had equal access to make the required calls.
  Answer choice E is helpful because it ensures that both groups had an equal amount of time to prepare for the study.
  Therefore, the least helpful answer is A: There was the same number of people in each group.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, and this is based on the fact that Group A (65-75 years old) performed better in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than Group B (college students).
To establish the conclusion, it is important that the study controls for other factors that could have influenced the outcome of the study.
Option A is helpful in establishing that the two groups are equal in number, which is an important factor to ensure that there is no bias in the study.
Option B is also helpful in establishing that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which is important to ensure that there is no bias in the way the calls were answered.
Option C is helpful in establishing that there were no older college students who could have performed better in the study.
Option D is helpful in establishing that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which is important to ensure that the study is fair.
Option E is helpful in establishing that the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which is important to ensure that the study is fair.
The option that is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn is C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old. This option does not affect the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages. Therefore, the answer is C. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence is that Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A.
  We need to find the least helpful statement in establishing the conclusion.
  A, B, D, and E are all helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  C is the least helpful because it does not provide any relevant information about memory recall.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence is that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) had only one lapse in making the telephone call, while Group B (composed of college students) had fourteen lapses.
  We need to find the statement that does not help to establish the conclusion.
  Statement A, D, and E provide relevant information.
  Statement B tells us about researchers but does not give us any information about the memory of the callers.
  Statement C provides information about the age of college students, but it does not relate to memory.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.

  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the evidence that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) had only one lapse in making a telephone call precisely at a specified time while Group B (composed of college students) had fourteen lapses.
  The least helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn would be the one that does not relate to the conclusion or the evidence.
  Option A is relevant to the conclusion as it establishes that the number of people in each group was equal, which is necessary for a fair comparison.
  Option B is relevant to the conclusion as it establishes that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which eliminates the possibility of bias in answering the calls.
  Option C is relevant to the conclusion as it establishes that among the college students, there were no persons more than forty years old, which eliminates the possibility of age being a confounding factor.
  Option D is relevant to the conclusion as it establishes that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which eliminates the possibility of a lack of access to a telephone being a confounding factor.
  Option E is relevant to the conclusion as it establishes that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which eliminates the possibility of a difference in the time to prepare being a confounding factor.
  Therefore, the answer is the option that is least relevant to the conclusion or the evidence.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages based on the study that Group A performed far better than Group B.
  We need to find the least helpful statement to establish the conclusion.
  Statement A, D, and E seem relevant to establishing the conclusion, so they are not the answer.
  Statement B is relevant as it shows that the researchers were the same, which ensures consistency in how the data was collected.
  Statement C, however, is not directly related to the conclusion and does not provide any information about the memory of either group. Therefore, it is the least helpful statement.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence is that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) had only one lapse, while Group B (composed of college students) had fourteen lapses.
  We need to find which statement would be least helpful in supporting the conclusion.
  Statement A, D, and E all seem relevant.
  Statement B might be helpful as it rules out the possibility of different researchers having different standards or procedures.
  Statement C, if true, would not be relevant in establishing the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
Action: Answer("C")

  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence provided is that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) performed better than Group B (composed of college students) in making a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  We need to find the option that is LEAST helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Option A is relevant to the study and helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Option B is also relevant to the study and helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Option C is somewhat relevant, but it does not impact the conclusion since it does not provide any information about the memory of college students.
  Option D is relevant to the study and helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Option E is also relevant to the study and helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.
Question: The reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: widespread cynicism is beneficial to the wellbeing of society
  B: cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the am01mt of information one has about them
  C: the work of contemporary journalists reflects a cynicism that is not really genuine
  D: any accurate description of human bebavior portrays it as selfish
  E: cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society
Response 0:

  The commentator argues that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being.
  The commentator justifies this claim by stating that journalists have always been cynics and are now more restrained than their predecessors.
  The commentator's argument overlooks the possibility that the cynicism of contemporary journalists may have a negative effect on society, despite the fact that journalists have always been cynics.
  Therefore, the answer is E: cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
The commentator argues that the cynicism of contemporary journalists is not a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being.
The commentator supports his argument by claiming that journalists have always been cynics and that today's journalists are more restrained than their predecessors.
However, the commentator overlooks the possibility that the cynicism of contemporary journalists could be more harmful than the cynicism of their predecessors.
Therefore, the answer is not A, C, D, or E. 
The best answer is B, which suggests that the commentator's argument overlooks the possibility that cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the amount of information one has about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The commentator argues that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of society's well-being because journalists have always been cynics and today's journalists are more restrained than their predecessors.

Response 4:
Thought: 
  The commentator argues that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being because journalists have always been cynics.
  The reasoning in the commentator's argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that something else contributed to the undermining of our society's well-being.
  The answer choice that best reflects this possibility is E: cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The commentator argues that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being because journalists have always been cynics and today's journalists are more restrained than their predecessors.
  The commentator's argument overlooks the possibility that the cynicism of contemporary journalists has a negative effect on people's attitudes towards success and altruistic actions of powerful people, which could lead to a lack of trust in society and institutions.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, C, D, or E as they are not relevant to the commentator's argument.
  The answer is B because the commentator does not consider the possibility that as people have more information about the motives of powerful people, they become more cynical about them, which could have a negative effect on society's well-being.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The commentator's argument claims that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being.
  The commentator's argument supports this claim by saying that journalists have always been cynics and today's journalists are more restrained than their predecessors.
  The reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that there could be other factors that are contributing to the undermining of our society's well-being.
  Option A is incorrect because the commentator's argument does not claim that widespread cynicism is beneficial to the well-being of society.
  Option B is incorrect because the commentator's argument claims that today's journalists are more restrained than their predecessors, which suggests that cynicism about the motives of powerful people may not necessarily increase with the amount of information one has about them.
  Option C is incorrect because the commentator's argument claims that journalists have always been cynics, which suggests that the cynicism of contemporary journalists is genuine.
  Option D is incorrect because the commentator's argument does not claim that any accurate description of human behavior portrays it as selfish.
  Option E could be a possible criticism because the commentator's argument does not address whether the cynicism of journalists has always had a negative effect on society's well-being.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The study found that rare species tend to survive longer than the most common species.
  We need an explanation for this pattern.
  Option A is not helpful in explaining the pattern.
  Option B suggests that older trees cannot reproduce which is not related to the pattern.
  Option C does not provide any useful information about the pattern.
  Option D is not relevant to the pattern.
  Option E suggests that trees of the common species have more competition for resources and this may explain why rare species survive longer.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The study found that trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
  We need to find the answer that most helps to explain this observation.
  Option A talks about the reason why the most common species thrives in a forest, but it doesn't explain why the rarest species survives longer.
  Option B is irrelevant to the observation.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the observation.
  Option D might be a reason why rare species are important to the forest, but it doesn't explain why they survive longer.
  Option E suggests that the trees of common species have more competition for resources, which might explain why the rarest species survive longer.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question is asking to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
  The passage states that regardless of which species is the most common and which is the rarest, trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  Choice A provides a possible reason for why the most common species thrives in a forest, but does not explain why the rarest species survives longer.
  Choice B provides a possible reason for why older trees may not reproduce as much, but does not explain why rare species survive longer than common species.
  Choice C does not provide any explanation for the survival patterns of the different species.
  Choice D provides a possible reason for why it is beneficial for the rare species to survive longer, but does not explain why the rare species is able to survive longer.
  Choice E provides a possible explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species. If the trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species, then it is possible that the rare species is able to survive longer because it faces less competition for resources.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.

Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument states that we can only praise or blame someone if we know a lot about the events leading up to their action.
  The argument rejects Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about these events would make us cease to regard the action as freely performed.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn should support the idea that we need a lot of information to praise or blame someone.
  Choice A suggests that we should not blame or praise someone for actions beyond their control, but this does not support the idea that we need a lot of information to blame or praise someone.
  Choice B suggests that how much information others possess about an act does not determine whether the person doing it is genuinely responsible, but this does not support the idea that we need a lot of information to blame or praise someone.
  Choice C restates the argument's premise, but does not enable the conclusion to be drawn.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise them varies with the amount of information available. This supports the idea that we need a lot of information to blame or praise someone.
  Choice E suggests that if we don't know much about the events leading up to an action, we will regard it as freely performed. This does not support the idea that we need a lot of information to blame or praise someone.

  Option A suggests that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control but this does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  Option B suggests that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  Option C supports the conclusion of the argument by stating that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  Option D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. This does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  Option E suggests that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed. This does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The argument also states that Tolstoy's claim that knowing more about the events leading to an action would make us stop regarding that action as freely performed is wrong.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn must support the idea that we can still praise or blame a person even if we know a lot about the events leading up to an action.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B is a restatement of the argument, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  Choice C is a restatement of the argument, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E contradicts the argument because it suggests that the less we know about the events leading up to an action, the more likely we are to regard that action as freely performed.
  The only choice that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn is B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The conclusion of the argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed. 
The argument suggests that we need to know a lot about the events that led to an action to be justified in praising or blaming a person for that action. 
To enable this conclusion to be properly drawn, we need an assumption that supports the idea that we need to know a lot about the events leading up to an action to be justified in praising or blaming a person for that action.
Option A is a possible assumption, but it does not support the idea that we need to know a lot about the events leading up to an action to be justified in praising or blaming a person for that action. 
Option B is also a possible assumption, but it does not support the idea that we need to know a lot about the events leading up to an action to be justified in praising or blaming a person for that action. 
Option C is close to the conclusion of the argument, but it is not an assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn. 
Option D is a possible assumption that supports the idea that our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. 
Option E is not a possible assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn.
Therefore, the correct answer is D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  The argument aims to reject Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about those events would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The correct answer choice will support the argument's conclusion.
  Choice A directly contradicts the argument.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C restates the argument.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E contradicts the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know enough about the events that led to that action.
  The conclusion of the argument is that Tolstoy's claim that knowing more about the events leading up to an action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed is wrong.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn should support the idea that knowing more about the events leading up to an action does not affect whether or not we regard that action as freely performed.
  Choice B states that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  This supports the idea that knowing more about the events leading up to an action does not affect whether or not we regard that action as freely performed.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument is that we should reject Tolstoy's claim that if we knew more about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The conclusion is that we are justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  To enable this conclusion, we need an assumption that connects the justification for praising or blaming to the amount of knowledge we have about the events leading up to an action.
  Choice A is not directly related to the conclusion.
  Choice B is close, but it doesn't directly connect the justification for praise or blame with the amount of knowledge.
  Choice C directly connects the justification for praise or blame with the amount of knowledge, so it is a possible assumption.
  Choice D is not directly related to the conclusion.
  Choice E is the opposite of what the argument is suggesting, so it weakens rather than strengthens the argument.
  Therefore, the best choice is C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The argument states that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events leading up to that action. 
The conclusion is that Tolstoy's claim is false. 
For the conclusion to be properly drawn, the assumption must support the idea that knowing more about the events leading up to an action does not mean that we cannot regard that action as freely performed.
Option A suggests that people should not be praised or blamed for actions caused by conditions beyond their control. This does not support the conclusion of the argument.
Option B suggests that the responsibility for an act is not determined by how much information others have about it. This also does not support the conclusion of the argument.
Option C supports the conclusion of the argument by stating that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we regard that action as freely performed.
Option D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree. This does not support the conclusion of the argument.
Option E suggests that we will regard an action as freely performed if we do not know much about the events leading up to it. This contradicts the argument's premise that we must know a lot about the events leading up to an action to justify praising or blaming a person for that action.
Therefore, the assumption that enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn is C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  The conclusion of the argument is that Tolstoy's claim that we would cease to regard an action as freely performed if we knew a lot about the events leading up to it is rash.
  To properly draw this conclusion, we need to assume an answer that supports the ethicist's argument.
  Answer A is not relevant to the argument.
  Answer B is close, but it does not support the conclusion that Tolstoy's claim is rash.
  Answer C is a restatement of the premise, not an assumption that supports the conclusion.
  Answer D is also close, but it does not support the conclusion that Tolstoy's claim is rash.
  Answer E is the opposite of what the ethicist is arguing.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices enable the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument states that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  The argument also rejects Tolstoy's claim that we would not regard any action as freely performed if we knew a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  The assumption must state that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action does not affect whether we can praise or blame someone for that action.
  Choice B states that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  This assumption supports the conclusion of the argument.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The economists assert that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically is a better approach to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization than reducing migration from rural areas.
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion.
  Answer choice A is irrelevant since it talks about government subsidies to urban manufacturers.
  Answer choice B is too broad and not specific to the topic.
  Answer choice C supports the economists' assertion since it suggests that there is a scarcity of agricultural products, which means that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically would be a viable solution.
  Answer choice D is irrelevant since it talks about problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas being primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  Answer choice E contradicts the economists' assertion since it suggests that free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The economists suggest trading goods or services produced in urban areas to obtain agricultural products previously produced domestically.
  The answer choice that would best support this suggestion would be one that highlights the benefits or feasibility of this approach.
  Answer choice A talks about government subsidies to urban manufacturers, which is not directly related to the economists' suggestion.
  Answer choice B is too general and does not relate to the context.
  Answer choice C highlights the scarcity of agricultural products, which supports the idea of trading for these products.
  Answer choice D talks about trade imbalances between countries, which is not directly related to the context.
  Answer choice E suggests that free trade policies can exacerbate problems caused by urbanization, which is not consistent with the economists' suggestion.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population could solve the problems caused by urbanization.
  The question asks for the choice that provides the most support for the economists' assertion.
  Choice (C) seems to provide the most support for the economists' assertion because it states that a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization, which implies that obtaining agricultural products through trade could help solve the problems.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically could solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion.
  If a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization, then it would support the economists' assertion.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically can solve the problems caused by urbanization.
  To support the economists' assertion, we need to find an option that shows that trading goods or services produced by an urban population can solve the problems caused by urbanization.
  Option A talks about government subsidies to urban manufacturers, which is irrelevant.
  Option B is too general and does not provide any specific information to support the economists' assertion.
  Option C suggests that agricultural products are scarce, but it does not provide any information on how trading goods or services produced by an urban population can solve the problems caused by urbanization.
  Option D talks about trade imbalances between countries, which is irrelevant.
  Option E suggests that free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization, which contradicts the economists' assertion.
  Therefore, none of the given options support the economists' assertion.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population to obtain agricultural products could solve the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
  To support this assertion, we need to find an option that shows that trading goods or services is a better alternative than reducing migration from rural areas.
  Option C suggests that agricultural products are a central element of many problems created by urbanization. So, trading goods or services to obtain agricultural products could solve the problems more effectively than reducing migration from rural areas.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population is a more effective solution to the problems created by urbanization.
  Therefore, the answer choice that supports this assertion the most should suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population is an effective solution to the problems created by urbanization.
  Answer choice A is irrelevant to the assertion.
  Answer choice B is too broad and does not relate to the assertion.
  Answer choice C suggests that agricultural products are important to the problems created by urbanization, but it does not support the assertion that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population is an effective solution.
  Answer choice D is irrelevant to the assertion.
  Answer choice E suggests that free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization, which supports the assertion that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population is a more effective solution.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
The question asks for the statement that provides the most support for the economists' assertion that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population is an effective way to solve problems resulting from urbanization.
Option A implies that government subsidies can ease the problems caused by migration but does not provide support for the economists' assertion.
Option B is a general statement and does not provide support for the economists' assertion.
Option C implies that there is a scarcity of agricultural products, which supports the idea that trading goods or services produced by the urban population for agricultural products can be effective in solving problems resulting from urbanization.
Option D suggests that problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries, which is irrelevant to the economists' assertion.
Option E suggests that free trade policies can exacerbate problems caused by increasing urbanization, which is irrelevant to the economists' assertion.
Therefore, the most relevant option is C.
Action: Answer("C")

  Therefore, the answer is C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The economists suggest trading goods or services produced by urban areas for agricultural products.
  To support this suggestion, we need to find an option that links urban production with agricultural products.
  Option A is irrelevant to the issue mentioned in the question stem.
  Option B is too general and doesn't relate to the issue.
  Option C points out the importance of agricultural products in the context of urbanization, but it doesn't support the economists' assertion.
  Option D is irrelevant to the issue mentioned in the question stem.
  Option E goes against the economists' assertion that trading goods or services can solve the problem effectively.
  Therefore, none of the given options support the economists' assertion, and we have to choose the most likely option that goes against their assertion.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The pharmacist's argument states that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are evidently correct.
  The argument is based on a large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia that showed most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  The argument assumes that the study supports the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  The argument confuses the effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates most of insomnia's symptoms, but it did not show that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  Therefore, the answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The pharmacist claims that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are evidently correct.
  The claim is based on the study that showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  The pharmacist infers that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages based on the study.
  The argument seems to have no problem with the use of terms or the sample used in the study.
  The problem with the argument is that it confuses the effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  Therefore, the answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The pharmacist's argument is that a study showed that melatonin alleviates insomnia's symptoms.
  Therefore, the claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct.
  The argument seems to rely on the study's results to support the claim made by the manufacturers.
  The argument does not seem to have any of the flaws mentioned in the choices except for D.
  The argument seems to confuse the effect of melatonin on insomnia's symptoms with the cause of the production of melatonin by the pineal gland.
  Therefore, the answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are evidently correct.
  The evidence used is a large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia.
  The study showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  The argument infers from the effect of ingesting melatonin that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  This inference does not necessarily follow from the evidence provided.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The pharmacist argues that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because a study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates most symptoms of insomnia in people aged 65-81.

  The argument is not depending on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.
  The argument is not confusing an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The argument is not relying on a sample that is unrepresentative.
  Therefore, the argument is not flawed.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The pharmacist claims that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are evidently correct.
  The argument is based on a study that showed ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms for people aged 65-81.
  The pharmacist assumes that the study supports the claim that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  There is no direct evidence in the study that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  Therefore, the pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that the claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms and the study shows that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  However, the argument fails to establish the causal relationship between the two. It is possible that the study shows that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, but it does not necessarily mean that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The pharmacist concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
  The pharmacist's evidence is that a large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  However, the evidence does not support the conclusion.
  The study only shows that melatonin is effective for alleviating insomnia symptoms in the studied population.
  The study does not prove that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  Therefore, the pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment.
  The logically strongest counter to the physician's argument would be a statement that undermines the validity of the experiment or the conclusion drawn from it.
  (A) is not a counter to the experiment itself, but rather a statement about a potential confounding factor.
  (B) is not a counter to the experiment or the conclusion drawn from it, but rather a statement about the effectiveness of medication.
  (C) is not a counter to the experiment or the conclusion drawn from it, but rather a statement about the scope of the experiment.
  (D) is not a counter to the experiment or the conclusion drawn from it, but rather a statement about the scientists involved in the experiment.
  (E) is a potential counter to the experiment and the conclusion drawn from it, as it suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients may have confounded the results.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the physician's conclusion.
  If knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in a patient's condition, then the improvement in the first group could be due to a placebo effect, not the magnets themselves. This weakens the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the second group did.
  The question asks for the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.
  A is not a counter to the physician's argument because it does not address whether magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain.
  B is not a counter to the physician's argument because it does not address whether magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain.
  C is not a counter to the physician's argument because it does not address whether magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain.
  D is not a counter to the physician's argument because it does not address whether magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain.
  E is a possible counter to the physician's argument because it suggests that the variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could be responsible for the different outcomes between the two groups.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  The strongest counterargument would be one that undermines the physician's reasoning or evidence.
  Option A points out a potential alternative explanation for the reduction in pain.
  Option B presents an opinion that is not relevant to the evidence.
  Option C is not relevant to the conclusion that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  Option D does not undermine the physician's reasoning or evidence.
  Option E suggests that the variation in the causes of the chronic back pain could be a factor affecting the results of the experiment.
  Option E is the strongest counterargument as it suggests a flaw in the experimental design.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The physician argues that the magnets are effective at relieving back pain because most patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain.
  To counter this argument logically, we need to provide a statement that weakens the physician's argument.
  The statement that shows that the reduction in pain is not solely due to the magnets would weaken the physician's argument.
  Option A suggests that the improvement in the patient's condition may be due to their knowledge of the treatment, not the treatment itself, which weakens the physician's argument.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E does not directly weaken the physician's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  To counter this argument logically, we need to present evidence that weakens the conclusion that magnetic fields are effective at relieving some back pain.
  Choice A is not a strong counter because it is a general statement about patient's knowledge and improvement, and does not address the specific experiment.
  Choice B is also not a strong counter because it is a general statement about physician's belief and does not address the specific experiment.
  Choice C is not a strong counter because it simply states that no other experiments have been done in other areas, which does not affect the validity of the specific experiment.
  Choice D is not a strong counter because it is a statement about the scientists' beliefs, which does not affect the experiment itself.
  Choice E is the strongest counter because it points out a significant variable in the experiment: the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients. This means that the results of the experiment may not be generalizable to all patients with chronic back pain.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an answer choice that contradicts the physician's conclusion.
  Answer choice A suggests that the patients' belief that they are receiving treatment could have caused the improvement in their condition, not necessarily the magnets.
  Answer choice B is irrelevant to the argument about magnetic fields.
  Answer choice C is also irrelevant to the argument about magnetic fields.
  Answer choice D is irrelevant to the argument about magnetic fields.
  Answer choice E suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could have influenced the results. Therefore, it weakens the physician's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The physician argues that the magnets are effective in relieving back pain based on the experiment conducted.
  To counter the physician's argument, we need to find an option that weakens the argument.
  Option A is not relevant to the effectiveness of magnets in relieving back pain.
  Option B is irrelevant because the argument is not about medication being more effective than magnets.
  Option C is also not relevant to the argument, as the argument is only about the effectiveness of magnets in relieving back pain.
  Option D is not relevant as the involvement of scientists in the experiment is not necessary to prove the effectiveness of magnets in relieving back pain.
  Option E weakens the argument because the wide variation in specific causes of chronic back pain could mean that the reduction in pain experienced by the group that received magnetic treatment could be due to other factors.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The physician claims that magnetic fields are effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment with 50 patients.
  We need to find a statement that weakens the conclusion of the argument.
  Option A suggests that the improvement in the patient's condition may not be due to the treatment.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C does not weaken the conclusion of the argument.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E suggests that the variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain may have skewed the results of the experiment.
  Therefore, option E is the strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  To find the logically strongest counter, we need to find an option that weakens the physician's argument.
  Option A is irrelevant to the physician's argument.
  Option B is also irrelevant as it talks about medication and not magnets.
  Option C is not a strong counter to the physician's argument as it only says that no other experiments were done in areas other than the back.
  Option D is not relevant to the physician's argument.
  Option E is the most likely answer as it weakens the physician's argument by showing that there was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the surprising result?
Choices:
  A: For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
  B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
  C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The Maxlast hammers were on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  The correct answer should explain why customers chose to buy the Styron hammers instead of the Maxlast hammers.
  Option C suggests that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  This suggests that many customers who wanted to buy a hammer may have already bought the Maxlast hammer during the sale.
  Therefore, the customers who bought the Styron hammers instead could be those who wanted to buy a hammer but had already bought the Maxlast hammer on sale.
  Thus, option C best explains the surprising result.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The Maxlast hammers were put on sale and displayed prominently at the entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  If true, the answer choice should explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Answer choice C is a possible explanation. If customers bought Maxlast hammers because they were on sale, then these customers might not have bought a hammer if it was not on sale.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The Maxlast hammers were placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  The result was surprising because the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  We need to find an option that explains why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers despite being at their usual location and price.
  Option C suggests that customers bought Maxlast hammers because they were on sale.
  This implies that the sale price on Maxlast hammers was not enough to attract customers to buy them.
  Therefore, the customers who bought Maxlast hammers last week also considered the sale as a reason for buying a hammer at that time.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  To explain this surprising result, we need to find a reason why customers chose to buy Styron hammers instead of Maxlast hammers during the sale.
  Option A doesn't explain the surprising result.
  Option B is irrelevant to the sale of hammers.
  Option C doesn't provide a reason why customers chose Styron hammers.
  Option D explains why customers knew about the sale, but not why they chose Styron hammers.
  Option E suggests that a sale on a single item is not enough to motivate customers to make a special trip to the store, but doesn't explain why customers chose Styron hammers over Maxlast hammers during the sale.
  The best answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  We need to find an option that explains why the Styron hammers sold more than the Maxlast hammers.
  Option A is irrelevant because it does not provide any information that explains the surprising result.
  Option B is also irrelevant because it suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices, which contradicts the fact that both brands generally sell roughly equal numbers.
  Option C suggests that the sale on Maxlast hammers triggered customers to buy hammers that week, which supports the idea that the sale on Maxlast hammers motivated people to buy hammers in general, but it does not explain why more people bought Styron hammers instead of Maxlast hammers.
  Option D suggests that the hardware store advertised the sale prices on Maxlast hammers, which might have attracted customers who were specifically looking for Maxlast hammers on sale. However, it still does not explain why more people bought Styron hammers instead of Maxlast hammers.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, but it does not explain why more people bought Styron hammers instead of Maxlast hammers.
  The best option that explains the surprising result is D because it suggests that customers who came into the store looking for Maxlast hammers might have been attracted by the sale prices and ended up buying Styron hammers instead. Therefore, Answer("D") is the correct answer.
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The surprising result is that Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  The sale and display of Maxlast hammers may have attracted customers to the store.
  However, there may be other factors that explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option C suggests that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time. This suggests that the sale motivated customers to buy Maxlast hammers, but the same sale did not motivate customers to buy Styron hammers.
  Therefore, option C is the most likely explanation for the surprising result.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  If customers were not aware of the sale on Maxlast hammers, then it would not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Choice A does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  If customers were not motivated by low prices, then it would not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  If customers who bought Maxlast hammers mentioned the sale as their reason for buying, then it would suggest that customers were aware of the sale but still chose to buy Styron hammers.
  If the hardware store circulated flyers publicizing the sale on Maxlast hammers, then it would suggest that customers were aware of the sale but still chose to buy Styron hammers.
  If a single item on sale would not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, then it would suggest that customers were already in the store and chose to buy Styron hammers instead of Maxlast hammers.
  Choice E is the most likely explanation for the surprising result.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The stimulus says that the Maxlast hammers were placed on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  The Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  We need to find a statement that explains why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  Option C provides a possible explanation that the customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time. This suggests that customers who were interested in buying the Maxlast hammers came and bought them in the sale.
  This means that the Styron hammers were bought by customers who were not interested in buying Maxlast hammers even though they were on sale.
  Therefore, option C is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The hardware store usually sells equal numbers of Maxlast and Styron hammers.
  Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  We need to find an option that explains why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option A and E are irrelevant to the situation.
  Option B suggests that customers are not price-sensitive, which is not relevant to the situation.
  Option C suggests that customers bought the Maxlast hammers because of the sale, but it doesn't explain why customers bought fewer Maxlast hammers than Styron hammers.
  Option D suggests that customers may have known about the sale, but it does not explain why customers bought more Styron hammers than Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, none of the given options seem to explain the surprising result.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Option C provides some information about why customers bought Maxlast hammers last week.
  Option D mentions that the hardware store advertised the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  Option A, B, and E do not provide any relevant information that explains the surprising result.
  Therefore, the best answer is either C or D.
  If the customers who bought the Maxlast hammers only bought them because of the sale, then it is less surprising that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers. 
  If the hardware store advertised the sale prices on Maxlast hammers, then it is possible that customers who were not planning on buying a hammer decided to buy one because of the sale.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument is that although viewers thought that Lopez had made the better arguments, their opinion may have been biased because Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a choice that suggests that the viewers' opinion was not biased towards Lopez.
  Option B suggests that the live audience watching the debate thought that Tanner was more persuasive.
  This would indicate that the viewers' opinions were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Therefore, option B most seriously undermines the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually did win the election.
  To undermine this, we need to find evidence that there is another reason why Lopez won the election.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it talks about the people who voted in the election, not the survey respondents.
  Choice B is a possible alternative explanation for why Lopez won the election, so it weakens the argument.
  Choice C is also a possible alternative explanation for why Lopez won the election, so it weakens the argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it talks about the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate, not the viewers surveyed immediately after the debate.
  Choice E does not necessarily undermine the argument because Lopez could have won the election by a narrow margin due to the bias of the survey respondents.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or C.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument is that the viewers who thought Lopez made better arguments may have been biased in favor of Lopez since he won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to show that there is another reason why the viewers thought Lopez made better arguments.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B weakens the argument by suggesting that the survey respondents may not have been representative of the live audience.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E does not undermine the argument, but rather reinforces it by suggesting that the viewers who thought Lopez made better arguments were correct since he won by a narrow margin.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  If most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  If the people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  If most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  If Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin, then it does not undermine the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  
Action: Answer("A")  
The fact that most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate undermines the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B does not undermine the argument, but it strengthens it.
  Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D does not undermine the argument, but it strengthens it.
  Option E does not undermine the argument because it does not address whether the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were biased in favor of Lopez.
  Thus, the best answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, it would undermine the argument that Lopez had made the better arguments.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  If Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin, it would not undermine the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is that respondents who thought that Lopez had made better arguments may have been biased in favor of him because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that the respondents' opinion was not influenced by Lopez's eventual victory.
  Option A might be true, but it is not relevant to the argument.
  Option B does not undermine the argument because it does not address the issue of Lopez's eventual victory.
  Option C might be true, but it does not address the issue of bias in favor of Lopez.
  Option D strengthens the argument because it suggests that Tanner was more popular before the debate.
  Option E does not undermine the argument, but it does not strengthen it either.
  Therefore, the best answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  If most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Therefore, A strengthens the argument and is not the answer.
  If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Therefore, B strengthens the argument and is not the answer.
  If the people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Therefore, C strengthens the argument and is not the answer.
  If most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Therefore, D weakens the argument and is the answer.
  E is irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is that survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez since Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a choice that suggests a different reason for why Lopez won the election.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it talks about people who voted in the election, not survey respondents.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about the opinions of a live audience, not survey respondents.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because it talks about the relationship between watching the debate and voting for Tanner, not Lopez.
  Choice D does not undermine the argument because it talks about survey respondents prior to the debate, not the ones who watched the debate.
  Choice E suggests that Lopez's victory was not due to bias among survey respondents, but rather it was a close election. This undermines the argument that Lopez's victory was due to bias among survey respondents.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  If most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate, then the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez would not be undermined.
  If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez would be undermined because the live audience is less likely to be biased.
  If the people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate, then the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez would not be undermined.
  If most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner, then the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez would not be undermined.
  If Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin, then the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez would not be undermined.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is about the appropriateness of the university president's speech.
  Professor Riley characterizes the speech as inflammatory and therefore argues that it is inappropriate.
  However, Professor Riley has a long-standing feud with the president.
  The argument concludes that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  The argument fails to address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences.
  Therefore, the answer is B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is based on the idea that the university president's speech was inappropriate only if it was inflammatory.
  The argument fails to consider that a speech can be inappropriate for reasons other than being inflammatory.
  The argument also fails to address the possibility that an inflammatory speech may be appropriate for some audiences.
  The argument is not favoring the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing.
  The argument is not concluding that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  The argument also acknowledges that Professor Riley has a long-standing feud with the president, and therefore her testimony alone is not sufficient to conclude that the speech was inflammatory.
  However, the argument does not take into account the possibility that the speech could be inappropriate for reasons other than being inflammatory.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that we should not conclude that the university president's speech was inflammatory and inappropriate solely on the basis of Riley's testimony.
  The reason is that Riley has a long-standing feud with the president, and so her testimony may be biased.
  The argument is not flawed in that it takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory because it explicitly states that independent reasons are needed to deem the speech inflammatory.
  The argument is not flawed in that it fails to address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences because that is not the focus of the argument.
  The argument is not flawed in that it favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing because the argument is not taking sides but rather arguing against relying solely on biased testimony.
  The argument is not flawed in that it concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true because the argument is not claiming that Riley's claim is false, but rather that it should not be accepted solely on the basis of her biased testimony.
  The argument is not flawed in that it fails to address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded because the argument is not concerned with the validity of Riley's animosity.
  Therefore, none of the choices accurately describe the flaw in the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that we cannot conclude the president's speech was inflammatory solely based on Riley's testimony.
  It also states that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  The argument does not take for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory, so A is incorrect.
  The argument does not address whether or not an inflammatory speech may be appropriate for some audiences, so B is incorrect.
  The argument does not favor the university president's side simply because of the president's privileged standing, so C is incorrect.
  The argument does not conclude that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true, so D is incorrect.
  The argument does not address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded, so E is incorrect.
  Therefore, none of the choices are correct.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is based on the assumption that Professor Riley's testimony is not enough to conclude that the speech was inflammatory.
  The argument concludes that the speech was not inappropriate unless there are independent reasons to deem it inflammatory.
  The argument does not take into consideration the possibility that the speech could be inappropriate even if it is not inflammatory.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  The argument is not flawed in that it takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.

  The argument is not flawed in that it concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true.
  The argument is flawed in that it fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded.
  Therefore, the answer is E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that we should not conclude that the speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony.
  Unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  The argument is trying to show that Riley's testimony alone is insufficient to conclude that the speech was inappropriate.
  Therefore, it is not flawed in A, B, C, or D.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  The argument is valid.
Action: Answer("None of the above")

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country.
  The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  The government reported that there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the government's estimate of the number of people employed in X might have been overstated since some employees receive multiple paychecks.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The new program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the number of paychecks issued in the first quarter for which the program was used was higher than the actual number of people employed in X.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Therefore, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The new computer program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  The program was used for the first quarter, and some employers in X issued separate paychecks for different purposes.
  Therefore, the government's estimate of the number of people employed may have been affected by the multiple paychecks.
  The increase in the number of paychecks issued may not accurately reflect the growth in the number of people employed.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The new computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and uses that figure as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the government's estimate of the number of people employed in X will be inflated by the number of separate paychecks issued by employers.
  The claim that there was a large increase in the number of people employed in X may be an overestimate. 
  The correct answer should reflect this fact.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The new program counts the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers to determine the number of people employed.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  These separate paychecks would be counted as additional employees by the new program.
  Therefore, the number of people employed would be overestimated.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  The fact that some workers receive more than one paycheck per pay period is irrelevant to the conclusion.
  The fact that the government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used is also irrelevant to the conclusion.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
The new computer program counts the number of paychecks per pay period to determine the number of people employed.
Employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses and commissions.
Therefore, the number of paychecks issued per pay period is not equal to the number of people employed. It is possible that the increased number of paychecks could be due to the fact that some employees received multiple paychecks per pay period.
This means that the government's estimate of the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used may be inaccurate.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The new computer program used by the government of Country X tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the new program would have counted the same employee multiple times, once for each paycheck issued.
  As a result, the government's estimate of employment would be higher than the actual number of people employed.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
- The government of Country X used a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in the country.
- The program tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X and used that figure as its estimate of employment.
- The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
- In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
- This means that the number of paychecks issued is not equivalent to the number of employees.
- Therefore, the government's estimate of the number of people employed is likely to be overestimated.
- The correct answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The government used a new computer program to determine employment.
  The program counted the number of paychecks per pay period.
  The government reported a large increase in employment for the first quarter the program was used.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses/commissions.
  Therefore, the government's estimate of employment could be inaccurate.
  If some employers issued separate paychecks, the program may have double-counted those employees.
  The government did not report anything about employment prior to the new program.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
The government used a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in Country X.
The program counted the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers.
The government reported a large increase in employment compared to the preceding quarter.
Some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
Therefore, the government's estimate of employment could have been inflated due to the separate paychecks issued by some employers.
The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that the decline in Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales from 50% to 25% must have caused the company's net income from sales of the product to be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  However, the argument does not take into account the possibility that the market for hair dryers may have grown or shrunk over the past 5 years.
  The argument also assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has remained constant, which may not be true.
  The argument does not provide any information about Wilson Appliance's other products, so it cannot be concluded that the hair dryer is the company's least profitable product.

  Therefore, the reasoning in the argument is flawed.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that the decline in market share caused the company's net income from sales to be half of what it was five years ago, assuming that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed.
  The argument does not discuss the total sales of hair dryers or the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them.
  The argument also does not mention any other products produced by Wilson Appliance.
  The argument also overlooks the possibility of a price increase in Wilson Appliance's hair dryer.
  The argument does not provide any evidence that the hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed because it makes assumptions without evidence and overlooks other factors that could affect the company's net income.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the decline in Wilson Appliance's product share caused a decrease in net income.
  However, there is no evidence to support that the total sales of hair dryers have decreased.
  The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument does not provide any information about the profits of other companies that produce hair dryers.
  The argument does not discuss the possibility of other factors such as competition.
  The argument does not provide any evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Action: Answer("A")

Thought:
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% in the last five years.
  It also states that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed in the last five years.
  Finally, the argument concludes that the net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument does not provide any evidence to support this conclusion.
  It is possible that the total number of hair dryers sold has increased, which would mean that the company's net income from sales has not decreased.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that because the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer declined, the net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands came from the Americas through rafting on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean.
  To weaken this argument, we need to provide evidence that contradicts this claim.
  If there are other animal species on the islands that are not found in the Americas, it does not necessarily weaken the argument that the iguana species came from the Americas.
  If the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, it does not necessarily weaken the argument that they came from the Americas.
  If documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon, it does not necessarily weaken the argument that the iguanas rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean.
  If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, it contradicts the argument that the iguanas came from the Americas.
  If the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, it suggests that the iguanas may have been present in Australia before the fragmentation and could have rafted to the islands from there.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species found on the islands near Australia come from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an answer choice that shows that the iguana species on the islands did not come from the Americas.
  Answer choice A does not weaken the argument because the scientist did not claim that all animal species on the islands came from the Americas.
  Answer choice B also does not weaken the argument because genetic differences do not necessarily mean that the species did not come from the Americas.
  Answer choice C is irrelevant because the argument is not about how common iguanas rafting long distances are.
  Answer choice D strengthens the argument because it shows that closely related iguana species have been found in Australia.
  Answer choice E is also irrelevant because the argument is not about other plant and animal species found in Australia or South America.
  Therefore, the answer is A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands near Australia are closely related to those found in the Americas, and must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this idea.
  A does not weaken the argument because it does not relate to the iguana species.
  B does not weaken the argument because the genetic differences do not necessarily mean that the iguanas did not raft across the Pacific Ocean.
  C does not weaken the argument because the uncommonness of the documented cases does not mean it is impossible for the iguanas to have rafted across the Pacific Ocean.
  D strengthens the argument by suggesting that the iguanas may have come from Australia instead of the Americas.
  E does not weaken the argument because it does not relate to the iguana species.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  The correct answer will weaken this argument.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that rafting long distances is uncommon for iguanas.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it talks about other species and their lineages, not iguanas.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
If there are facts that contradict or weaken this argument, then the argument is weakened.
A weakener can be an alternative explanation, counterexample or evidence against the argument.
Option A provides an alternative explanation that not all the animal species on the islands came from the Americas.
Option B suggests that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas.
Option C is not relevant to the argument.
Option D suggests that iguana species have existed in Australia, so the ancestors of the island's iguanas could have come from there.
Option E is not relevant to the argument.
The best answer is D because it provides an alternative explanation that the iguanas' ancestors could have come from Australia, rather than the Americas, which weakens the argument that they must have rafted across the Pacific from the Americas.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The scientist argues that iguanas rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas to the islands near Australia.
  The correct answer choice will weaken this argument.
  If there are other explanations for the existence of the iguanas on the islands, then the argument is weakened.
  Choice A is irrelevant.
  Choice B does not necessarily weaken the argument, as the genetic differences could be attributed to evolutionary changes that occurred after the iguanas arrived on the islands.
  Choice C is also irrelevant.
  Choice D suggests that the iguanas may have originated in Australia rather than the Americas, which weakens the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The scientist claims that the iguana species on the islands originated from the Americas.
  If it is shown that the iguanas on the islands did not come from the Americas, then the argument would be weakened.
  Choice A is irrelevant because the argument is about the origin of the iguanas, not the other species.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument because the genetic differences could have arisen after the iguanas arrived on the islands.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because it does not challenge the plausibility of rafting as a means of transport.
  Choice D is not relevant to the origin of the iguanas on the islands.
  Choice E suggests that there may have been a land connection between Australia and South America prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, which would make rafting unnecessary.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the iguana species on the islands came from the Americas, but if there is evidence to suggest that they could have come from somewhere else, then the argument would be weakened.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about where the iguanas came from, so it does not weaken the argument.
  B: If the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, then it could suggest that they did not come from the Americas. This could weaken the argument.
  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances does not necessarily mean that it is impossible or did not occur in this case. This statement is not strong enough to weaken the argument.
  D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, it suggests that the iguanas on the islands could have come from Australia rather than the Americas. This statement could weaken the argument.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument about where the iguanas came from, so it does not weaken the argument.
  The best answer is either B or D. However, D provides stronger evidence that the iguanas could have come from Australia rather than the Americas. Therefore, the answer is D. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  If there are other plausible explanations for how the iguana species arrived on the islands, then the argument is weakened.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C weakens the argument slightly, but it does not provide a plausible alternative explanation for how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  Choice D supports the scientist's argument.
  Choice E weakens the argument significantly because it suggests that the iguana species could have existed on the islands before the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to provide evidence that suggests an alternative explanation for how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  Choice A does not weaken the argument because the argument only concerns the iguana species, not all the animal species on the islands.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument because genetic differences between species do not rule out the possibility of rafting.
  Choice C does not weaken the argument because uncommonness does not rule out the possibility of rafting.
  Choice D does not weaken the argument because the existence of fossils of closely related species in Australia is consistent with the argument that the species' progenitors rafted across the Pacific Ocean.
  Choice E suggests an alternative explanation for how the iguana species arrived on the islands, which is that the iguana species were present on the islands before the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.

Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The argument is based on the premise that studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
  The argument fails to consider the possibility that the latest safety technology might have improved significantly since the studies were conducted 30 years ago.
  Therefore, the flaw in the editorialist's argument is that it fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The council members argue that it would not decrease safety due to the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist refutes this argument by citing numerous studies conducted 30 years ago.
  The flaw in the editorialist's argument could be that the studies conducted 30 years ago may not be applicable today.
  Choice B presents this possibility as a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity will decrease safety.
  The council members say that the increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist disagrees and cites studies conducted 30 years ago to support their argument.
  The flaw in the argument is that the studies cited are outdated and may not apply to the latest safety technology.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The editorialist claims that safety would be reduced if the city council increases the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity.
  The council members say that the increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist argues that the council members are wrong because numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist assumes that the studies conducted 30 years ago are still relevant today, and that the latest safety technology cannot mitigate the safety risks.
  The flaw in the editorialist's argument is that it confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The editorialist cites studies conducted 30 years ago that show safety was reduced at every airport where permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity.
  The editorialist claims that the purchase of latest safety technology would not increase safety.
  The flaw in the argument is that the editorialist assumes that the studies conducted 30 years ago are still relevant today.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic will decrease safety based on studies from 30 years ago.
  The council members claim that the increase would not decrease safety due to the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist disagrees and claims that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity.
  The flaw in the argument is that the editorialist fails to consider the possibility that the latest safety technology might be more advanced than 30 years ago.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The council members argue that safety would not decrease as they would purchase the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist refutes the council's argument by citing studies conducted 30 years ago that show safety was reduced at every airport where permitted traffic was increased beyond design capacity, even with the latest safety technology.
  The flaw in the editorialist's argument is that it relies on outdated studies and does not consider the possibility that technology has improved in the last 30 years.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, based on studies conducted 30 years ago.
  However, the argument fails to consider the possibility that safety technology may have improved significantly since those studies were conducted.
  Therefore, the flaw in the editorialist's argument is that it fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The editorialist claims that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's design capacity would decrease safety based on studies conducted 30 years ago.
  However, the claim does not consider the possibility that the latest safety technology may have improved since those studies.
  Therefore, the argument fails to consider the possibility that a different conclusion could be reached with the latest safety technology.
  The answer is B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that the increase in air traffic would decrease safety.
  The editorialist supports the argument by stating that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity.
  The editorialist assumes that the latest safety technology wouldn't help to increase safety.
  The flaw in the argument is that the editorialist assumes that the latest safety technology wouldn't help to increase safety without any supporting evidence.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychiatrist: Take any visceral emotion you care to consider. There are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion. So, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Anger is always expressible.
  B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
  C: Some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express.
  D: All emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  E: An emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The premise is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion.
  The conclusion logically follows if it is assumed that anger is a visceral emotion.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The psychiatrist argues that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion, including anger.
  The conclusion is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The conclusion follows logically if the assumption that any visceral emotion is healthy to express.
  Choice A is too extreme because it uses the word "always" which is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice B is mentioned in the argument but it is not enough to make the conclusion.
  Choice C is opposite to the argument's claim and it does not follow logically.
  Choice D is too extreme and it is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice E is also too extreme and it is not mentioned in the argument.
  Therefore, the assumption that the conclusion follows logically is that any visceral emotion is healthy to express.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The psychiatrist is arguing that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The psychiatrist is using a general statement that applies to all visceral emotions, not just anger.
  Therefore, the assumption must be a general one that applies to all visceral emotions.
  Choice A is not a general assumption and is too extreme.
  Choice B is a reasonable assumption since the psychiatrist uses anger as an example of a visceral emotion.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument since the psychiatrist is only talking about situations where it is healthy to express emotions.
  Choice D is too extreme and is not supported by the argument.
  Choice E is too narrow since the argument is not just about visceral emotions.
  Therefore, the assumption that follows logically is B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The premise states that any visceral emotion can be healthy to express in certain situations.
  The conclusion follows logically if we assume that anger is a visceral emotion.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion.
  Then the argument concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  Therefore, the argument assumes that anger is a visceral emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The psychiatrist argues that there are always situations where it's healthy to express any visceral emotion.
  The psychiatrist specifically mentions anger as an example of a visceral emotion.
  Therefore, the conclusion of the argument is that it is always healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The assumption that is required for the conclusion to follow logically is that if a situation is healthy to express a visceral emotion, then it is healthy to express anger.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Anger is always expressible.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument states that there are always situations where it is healthy to express any visceral emotion.
  The argument specifically mentions anger as an example of a visceral emotion that can be healthy to express.
  Therefore, the conclusion that there are always situations where it is healthy to try to express one's anger follows logically if it is assumed that all visceral emotions are healthy to express.
  Choice A is too extreme, as it claims that anger is always expressible, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice B is mentioned in the argument, but it alone is not sufficient to support the conclusion.
  Choice C contradicts the argument and is not necessary for the conclusion.
  Choice D goes too far, as it claims that only emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  Choice E is also too extreme, as it claims that an emotion is only visceral if it is healthy to express.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: All emotions that are healthy to express are visceral. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion.
  The argument specifically mentions anger as an example of a visceral emotion.
  The conclusion is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The assumption that would make this conclusion logically follow is that anger is always a visceral emotion.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that for any visceral emotion, there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion.
  The psychiatrist specifically mentions anger as an example.
  Therefore, it can be concluded that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The conclusion follows logically if the assumption is that any visceral emotion is healthy to express in some situations.
  Choice A is not necessarily true, and the argument does not depend on it.
  Choice B is true, but it is not sufficient to support the conclusion.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the conclusion.
  Choice D is not necessarily true, and the argument does not depend on it.
  Choice E is incorrect, as the argument does not make this claim.
Action: Answer(None of the above)
Response 9:
Thought:
  The psychiatrist argues that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The argument assumes that anger is a visceral emotion.
  If anger is not a visceral emotion, then the argument falls apart.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the statistic that more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes.
  A possible criticism is that the argument overlooks other factors that may affect the safety of bicyclists on roads with bicycle lanes.
  Choice A addresses this possibility by suggesting that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious as those on roads without such lanes.
  Therefore, choice A is the best answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the statistics that reveal more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the possibility that other factors may be contributing to the higher collision rate.
  Choice A, C, D, and E are not related to the argument's vulnerability to criticism.
  Choice B is related to the argument's vulnerability to criticism since it suggests that the higher collision rate on roads with bicycle lanes may be due to more bicyclists riding on those roads.
  Therefore, the answer is B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the premise that there are more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument ignores other factors that could affect the safety of bicyclists on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
  The answer should address the argument's vulnerability to criticism.
  Choice A, C, D, and E do not criticize the argument's vulnerability directly.
  Choice B addresses the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes, which could affect the likelihood of collisions.
  Therefore, the answer is B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that designated bicycle lanes on roads increase bicycle-motor vehicle collisions.
  The conclusion of the argument is that adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  Choice A raises a concern that the argument has not addressed the severity of injuries on roads with and without bicycle lanes.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument's conclusion.
  Choice C raises an issue that the argument has not considered, that safety improvements for bicyclists may not translate to safety improvements for motorists.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument's conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that the injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are less serious, on average, than those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  Therefore, the answer is A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument presents statistical evidence to support the idea that adding bicycle lanes to roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address other possible factors that could affect the number of collisions.
  Choice A addresses the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  Choice B addresses the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
  Choice C addresses the assumption that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  Choice D does not address the criticism that the argument is vulnerable to.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is either A, B, or C. Among these, choice B is the most relevant to the argument. The argument assumes that the number of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles is the only factor that affects the safety of bicyclists. However, the number of bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes may be higher than the number of bicyclists riding on roads without such lanes, which could affect the number of collisions. Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
The argument claims that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists, and it supports this claim with the statistic that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes. 
Choice A is not relevant to the argument since the argument is not concerned with the severity of the injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents. 
Choice B is also not relevant to the argument since the argument is not concerned with the number of bicyclists riding on different types of roads. 
Choice C is not relevant to the argument since the argument is not concerned with the safety of motorists. 
Choice D is incorrect because the argument is not concerned with the safety of some roads, but rather with the safety of bicyclists on roads with designated bicycle lanes. 
Choice E is the best answer because it highlights the problem with using statistical evidence to support a conclusion that is not logically related to the evidence. 
Therefore, the answer is E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument presents a statistical evidence.
  The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The conclusion is based on the fact that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument does not consider other factors that might affect the likelihood of collisions.
  Answer choice A presents a possible criticism of the argument.
  Answer choice B does not address the argument's conclusion.
  Answer choice C presents an assumption that is not made in the argument.
  Answer choice D presents a criticism that is not relevant to the argument.
  Answer choice E presents a possible criticism of the argument.
  The most relevant criticism is that the argument overlooks other factors that might affect the likelihood of collisions, such as the behavior of motorists and bicyclists, the design of the bicycle lanes, and the location and traffic volume of the roads.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions occur on roads with designated bicycle lanes than on roads without such lanes. 
The argument does not consider the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes. 
Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes than roads without.
  The conclusion is that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address other possible factors that might be causing the higher number of collisions on roads with bicycle lanes.
  Choice A is not relevant because the argument does not compare the seriousness of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with and without bicycle lanes.
  Choice B is not relevant because the argument is based on the number of collisions, not the number of bicyclists.
  Choice C is not relevant because the argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  Choice D is also not relevant because the argument does not make any claims about the safety of roads with bicycle lanes.
  Choice E is the best criticism because it points out that the argument is using statistical evidence to support a conclusion that the evidence does not actually support.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: While it is true that bees' vision is well suited to the task of identifying flowers by their colors, it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the statement above?
Choices:
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Response 0:
Thought:
The statement is about the development of flowers and bees' vision.
We need to find the option that supports the idea that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
Option A provides information that is opposite to the statement.
Option B is irrelevant to the statement.
Option C is also irrelevant to the statement.
Option D is not helpful in supporting the statement.
Option E is not useful in supporting the statement.
Therefore, none of the options supports the statement.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Thought:
The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
To support this statement, we need an option that shows that flowers were developed keeping in mind the vision of bees.
Option A talks about insects similar to bees, but it doesn't prove that flowers were developed keeping in mind the vision of bees.
Option B, C, and D are irrelevant to the statement.
Option E talks about the present-day relationship between bees and flowers but doesn't provide any information about flower development.
Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The statement claims that it's probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  We need to find the option that supports this claim.
  Option A provides evidence against the statement.
  Option B could be a possible answer, but it doesn't directly support the claim.
  Option C doesn't provide any evidence to support the claim.
  Option D talks about nonflowering plants, which is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E doesn't support the claim; it's just a fact.
  Therefore, the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  To support this, we need to find an option that shows that flowers developed in response to bees' vision rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
  Option B suggests that some flowers rely on insects other than bees.
  This indicates that flowers are not dependent on bees and their vision for their survival.
  Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  We need to find an option that supports this claim.
  Option A states that other insects with similar vision do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This does not support the claim.
  Option B states that some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This does not support the claim.
  Option C states that the number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This might support the claim, but it is not strong enough.
  Option D states that many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This does not support the claim.
  Option E states that present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This option supports the claim that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The statement says that it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
  We need to find an answer choice that supports this statement.
  Answer choice A talks about other insects that have similar vision to bees, but do not depend on color perception. This is not relevant to the argument.
  Answer choice B says that some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This does not help us in determining whether flowers developed in response to bee vision or not.
  Answer choice C talks about the number of species of flowers and bees, but it is not relevant to the argument.
  Answer choice D says that many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This is not relevant to the argument.
  Answer choice E says that present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This answer choice is the opposite of what we are looking for. If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, it is more likely that bees' vision developed in response to flower color.
  None of the answer choices support the statement in the question. However, answer choice E contradicts the statement. Therefore, the most likely answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The statement claims that it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  The correct answer should provide support for this claim.
  A does not support the claim.
  B does not support the claim.
  C is irrelevant to the claim.
  D is irrelevant to the claim.
  E does not support the claim.
  Therefore, None of the above is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  We need to find an option that supports this claim.
  Option A talks about insects that have vision similar to bees but do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This does not support the statement.
  Option B is talking about flowers that rely on insects other than bees. This is not related to the statement.
  Option C talks about the number of different species of flowers and bees, but it does not support the statement above.
  Option D talks about nonflowering plants that rely on bees. This is not related to the statement.
  Option E states that present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This implies that bees are entirely dependent on flowers, and flowers must have developed to cater to the bees' needs. This supports the statement.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The statement suggests that the evolution of flowers is more likely to be influenced by bees than the other way around.
  To support this statement, we need to find an answer that shows that flowers developed features that are suited to bees' vision.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E does not provide any information that supports the statement.
  Choice A is the only choice that supports the statement by suggesting that bees' color vision is not a necessary adaptation for insects with similar vision.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
To support the statement, we need a fact that suggests flowers developed in response to bees' vision. 
If many insects that have vision similar to bees don't depend on perceiving an object's color, then it strongly suggests that flowers have evolved to attract bees. 
Other choices do not necessarily relate to how flowers and bees have evolved together. 
Therefore, the answer is A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.

Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage states that whipping cream in a blender results in a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  The passage also states that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  Therefore, statement A is true.
  Statement B is partially true, but it is too extreme. The passage does not say that the special attachment is completely ineffective, only that it cannot fully compensate for the blender's poor air intake.
  Statement C is false. The passage does not say that using the attachment always produces a fluffier result.
  Statement D is true. The passage says that the special attachment can help somewhat, which implies that it reduces the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively.
  Statement E is not mentioned in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
Action: Answer("A")

Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage states that using a blender to whip cream results in a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively.
  It also states that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  Therefore, the answer must be related to the effectiveness of the blender and/or the special whipping-cream attachment.
  A is true but it is not the answer to this question.
  B is implied by the passage, but it is not explicitly stated that the attachment does not suffice completely.
  C is not true because the passage states that the attachment helps somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  D is true because the passage states that the attachment can help somewhat, and it reduces the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E is not relevant to the question and not mentioned in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.

  The passage does not state that the special whipping-cream attachment does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively, so statement B is not necessarily true.
  The passage states that the special attachment can help somewhat, but it does not guarantee a fluffier result than without the attachment, so statement C is not necessarily true.
  The passage states that the attachment can help somewhat, but it does not state that it reduces the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively, so statement D is not necessarily true.
  The passage does not state anything about the most common way to produce whipped cream, so statement E is not necessarily true.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage states that using a blender to whip cream can result in a thick, velvety substance instead of fluffy whipped cream.
  It also states that a special whipping-cream attachment can help somewhat but not fully compensate for the blender's poor air intake.
  None of the statements suggest that cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  The passage says that the attachment can help somewhat, but it does not say that it is not sufficient to whip cream completely effectively.
  Although the attachment can help somewhat, the passage states that it cannot fully compensate for the blender's poor air intake, so it is not true that using the attachment always produces a fluffier result.
  The passage suggests that the attachment can help somewhat, but it does not state that it can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that a diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat.
  However, if everyone adopted this diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible.
  Therefore, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  This is similar to the reasoning in option C, where a spending pattern that is good for an individual is not recommended for everyone, as it would cause a severe recession in the economy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument presented states that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat protein.
  However, if everyone adopts this diet, it would lead to the extinction of marine species and make the diet impossible.
  Therefore, the universal adoption of this diet should not be recommended.
  Option A discusses the safety of vitamin E supplements and recommends not recommending them to everyone.
  Option B discusses the potential impact of high tobacco taxes on education funding.
  Option C discusses the impact of everyone limiting their purchases to what they need on the economy.
  Option D discusses the reason why legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  Option E discusses the impact of restricting land development in wilderness areas on species proliferation.
  Option E is most similar to the reasoning in the argument above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument states that a fish-based diet is healthier than a red meat-based diet.
  The argument also states that universal adoption of the fish-based diet would lead to extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that the fish-based diet should not be universally recommended.
  Option C presents a similar argument where a certain behavior is beneficial for individuals but if everyone adopts it, it would lead to a recession and make the behavior impossible.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument presents a conflict where a healthier diet is not recommended because it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  The conflict is between the benefits of the diet and the harm it would cause to marine species.
  Option A presents a conflict between the benefits of taking vitamin E supplements and the safety concerns of these supplements.
  Option B presents a conflict between the benefits of taxing tobacco and the potential reduction of funding for education.
  Option C presents a conflict between the benefits of limiting purchases to what one needs and the harm it would cause to the economy.
  Option D presents a conflict between the benefits of legislators doing their jobs and getting re-elected.
  Option E presents a conflict between the benefits of restricting land development in wilderness areas and the reduction of proliferation of certain species.
  The argument that most closely resembles the reasoning in the argument above is Option E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument presents a dilemma where a healthy diet based on fish protein would cause the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
  Option A presents a similar argument where taking vitamin E supplements every day has health benefits, but their safety for all people has not been established conclusively.
  Therefore, recommending the universal adoption of vitamin E supplements every day should not be done.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument presents a dilemma between the benefits of a fish-based diet and the negative impact on marine species.
  The negative impact would make the diet impossible to adopt universally.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend universal adoption of the diet.
  Choice C presents a similar dilemma between individual benefits and the negative impact on the economy.
  The negative impact would make the spending pattern impossible to adopt universally.
  Therefore, the answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that a certain diet is healthier than another diet.
  But the diet that is healthier is not sustainable because it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, universal adoption of the healthier diet is not recommended.
  The reasoning in this argument is similar to the reasoning in option C.
  The argument in option C claims that limiting purchases to what we truly need is better for consumers.
  But if everyone did this, it would cause a severe recession, making it impossible for most people to save and invest.
  Therefore, recommending this spending pattern to everyone is not recommended.
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument presents a situation where a healthier diet is not recommended because it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Option A presents a situation where a vitamin supplement is not recommended because it may not be safe for everyone.
  Option B presents a situation where heavy taxation on tobacco might lead to reduced funding for education.
  Option C presents a situation where limiting purchases to what one needs might lead to a recession if everyone did it.
  Option D presents a situation where legislators campaign a lot because it increases their chances of getting reelected.
  Option E presents a situation where restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve species but reduces the proliferation of other species.
  Option A, B, C, and D are not similar to the argument above.
  Option E presents a similar situation where a certain action is helpful in some ways but detrimental in others.
  Therefore, the answer is E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument states that a diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat.
  But if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  Option A discusses a similar situation where taking vitamin E supplements every day reduces the risk of heart attack.
  But it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people.
  So the argument concludes that we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  The reasoning in option A is similar to the reasoning in the argument above.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that a fish-based protein diet is healthier than a red meat-based protein diet.
  However, universal adoption of this diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that such a diet should not be recommended universally.
  Answer choice C presents a similar reasoning.
  It suggests that limiting purchases to what one truly needs and saving or investing the remaining income is better.
  However, if everyone did this, it would throw the economy into a recession, making saving and investing impossible for most people.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that this spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.
  Hence, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The employee argues that the company's website filtering policy is flawed because it assumes that access to non-work-related websites is a major distraction. The employee then provides a counterexample that offices with windows or decoration can also be highly distracting. 
To choose the answer that is most similar in reasoning, we need to find an argument that criticizes a policy by showing that the policy is flawed because it makes an unwarranted assumption.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessarily helpful because distractions can come from sources other than websites.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a successful novel, as other factors such as plot and writing style are also important.
  Both arguments suggest that a single factor is not necessarily the most important in achieving a desired outcome.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to improve productivity because other distractions exist in the workplace that are not being addressed.
  The argument must show that a certain action is unnecessary because there are other similar things that are not being addressed.
  Choice D presents a similar argument, stating that creating engaging characters is not the only requirement for success in the movie industry. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary as it blocks non-work-related websites and is a distraction to work.
  Offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can also be distracting.
  Therefore, the website filtering software is not necessarily the solution to improve the work environment.
  The argument in choice D is similar in its reasoning as it argues that engaging characters do not guarantee a sale, as publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  Therefore, the answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
The employee argues that the company's justification for website filtering is flawed because distractions are not limited to websites and that some offices can also be distracting. 
Option D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a novel's success because publishers may reject manuscripts that focus too much on character development. 
Option D is the answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
The employee argues that just like non-work-related websites, offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can also be highly distracting and that no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room. 
Option D argues that aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale. 
Option D is most similar to the employee's argument as it argues that even though engaging characters are important, they do not guarantee a sale. Similarly, the employee argues that website filtering may not necessarily lead to better focus and productivity as other factors such as the environment also play a role.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The employee argues that website filtering software is not effective in reducing distraction because other factors, such as having windows or nice decorations, can also be distracting. 
Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale because publishers and agents consider other elements as well. 
Choice D is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument.
Action: Answer("D")

But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other things, such as windows and decorations, can also be distracting. 
  The argument is that website filtering software is not the only thing that can be distracting, and therefore it is not necessary to install it.
  The argument in choice D is similar in that it argues that having engaging characters does not guarantee a sale, and therefore it is not necessary to focus solely on character development.
  The answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
The employee's argument is that website filtering software blocks access to non-work-related websites which can cause distraction. However, offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can also be distracting. The argument implies that website filtering software is not the only source of distraction and that it may not be the most effective way to increase productivity. 
Option D is similar in reasoning as it argues that creating engaging characters in writing classes does not guarantee success as publishers and agents may reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.
Response 0:

  The question asks for the answer that most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study.
  The finding of the study is that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  We need to find an option that explains why the nicotine level in the blood is the same.
  Option A talks about the maximum amount of nicotine that can be absorbed by the blood. However, it does not explain why the nicotine level in the blood is the same.
  Option B is irrelevant to the finding of the nicotine study.
  Option C provides an explanation that most of the nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities, which supports the finding of the nicotine study.
  Option D is irrelevant to the finding of the nicotine study.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the finding of the nicotine study.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If grain prices double then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that the price of grain-fed beef comes close to doubling when grain prices double, while the average price of a loaf of bread rises between 10 and 15 percent.
  The question asks for the choice that would most contribute to an explanation of this phenomenon.
  Choice A is about labor costs in cattle production, which is not directly relevant to the phenomenon.
  Choice B is about the price difference between beef and bread, but this does not explain why the price of beef is affected more by grain prices than bread.
  Choice C is about the cost components of producing bread and beef, but this does not explain why the price of beef is affected more by grain prices than bread.
  Choice D provides information about the proportion of beef produced from grain-fed cattle, which is directly relevant to the phenomenon.
  Choice E provides information about the purchasing patterns of retail grocery outlets, but this is not directly relevant to the phenomenon.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that if grain prices double, then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  The question is asking which answer choice would most contribute to an explanation of this phenomenon.
  Answer choice B seems irrelevant since it only compares the wholesale price per pound of beef and bread.
  Answer choice D may be a contributing factor, but it does not explain why the price of grain-fed beef would come close to doubling.
  Answer choice E may also be a contributing factor, but it only talks about the retail grocery outlets and not the production costs.
  Answer choice A may be a contributing factor since reducing labor costs could lead to cheaper beef prices, but it does not explain why the price of grain-fed beef would come close to doubling.
  Answer choice C seems to be the most relevant since it explains that the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef. Therefore, if grain prices double, then the cost of producing beef would increase significantly, leading to a higher price for grain-fed beef.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The phenomenon being described is that when grain prices double, the price of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, but the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  The question is asking which answer choice would best explain why this phenomenon occurs.
  Answer choices A, B, and E do not provide any information that would explain the phenomenon.
  Answer choice C suggests that the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef, which would explain why the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling when grain prices double.
  Answer choice D suggests that only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, which would suggest that the price of beef is more closely tied to the price of grain than to the price of grass.
  Therefore, answer choice D is the best answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described above is that when grain prices double:
  - the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  - the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  Option B provides information about the wholesale price per pound of beef and bread but does not explain the phenomenon.
  Option A provides information about labor costs but does not explain the phenomenon.
  Option C provides information about the cost of producing bread and beef but does not explain the phenomenon.
  Option D provides information about the proportion of beef sold in retail markets that is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, but it does not explain the phenomenon.
  Option E provides information about the retail grocery outlets that purchase the bread and meat they sell, which could explain the phenomenon.
  If grocery outlets purchase bread from small independent bakers and meat from large wholesale processing operations, it could mean that the cost of bread is not affected by the rising grain prices as much as the cost of meat, which is heavily dependent on grain. Therefore, E seems like the best answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that if grain prices double then the price of grain-fed beef will almost double, but the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Choice B may provide a possible explanation for this phenomenon if the wholesale price per pound of beef is much higher than that of bread.
  Choice C does not explain why the price of beef will almost double while the price of bread will only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Choice D is not relevant to the phenomenon described.
  Choice A and Choice E do not provide any information that relates to the phenomenon described.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Grain prices doubling will cause the price of bread to rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Grain-fed beef will almost double in price.
  The question is asking which of the following contributes to an explanation of the phenomenon.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the phenomenon.
  Choice B is not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Choice C is not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Choice D describes the proportion of beef sold from cattle fed on grass rather than grain which is not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Choice E could be relevant as it suggests that there is a difference in the supply chain between bread and meat, which could contribute to the difference in price impact between bread and beef.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described states that if grain prices double, the price of bread will rise 10-15%, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  Therefore, the cost of feeding cattle represents a significant portion of the cost of producing beef.
  Choice C states that the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  Hence, choice C appears to be the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling while the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double.
  The question asks which one of the following would most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above.
  Option B is not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Option A is also not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Option C is not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Option D is somewhat relevant, but it only refers to the proportion of beef produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, and it does not explain the phenomenon.
  Option E is also not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Therefore, none of the options provide a satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon.
  The answer is "None of the Above."
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described above is that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling if grain prices double, whereas the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  We need to find an option that explains the phenomenon.
  Option B provides information about the wholesale price per pound of beef and bread, but it does not explain the phenomenon.
  Option A provides information about the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef, but it does not explain the phenomenon either.
  Option C provides information about the cost of producing bread and beef, but it does not explain the phenomenon.
  Option D provides information about the proportion of beef produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, but it does not explain the phenomenon.
  Option E provides information about the retail grocery outlets that purchase the bread and meat they sell, and this option provides a possible explanation for the phenomenon described above.
  If retail grocery outlets purchase meat from large wholesale processing operations, then the price of meat will be more sensitive to changes in grain prices than the price of bread.
  Therefore, option E best contributes to an explanation of the phenomenon described above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that if grain prices double, the price of bread will increase between 10 and 15 percent, while the price of beef will nearly double.
  The question asks which statement would most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon.
  Statement B is irrelevant because it compares the wholesale price of bread and beef.
  Statement A is also irrelevant because it talks about reducing labor costs in producing beef, which does not explain why beef prices would double.
  Statement C is somewhat relevant, but it does not explain why the price of beef would come close to doubling.
  Statement D seems relevant because it implies that most beef is produced from grain-fed cattle, which would explain why the price of beef would increase so much if grain prices double.
  Statement E does not seem relevant because it talks about the purchasing habits of retail grocery outlets, which is not related to the phenomenon described.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to find a statement that provides additional support.
  Choice B states that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales. If this is true, then the researcher's findings on copper concentration in lichens can be applied to other areas and other types of air pollution.
Action: Answer("B")

  Answer choice A is irrelevant to the researcher's argument.
  Answer choice C is not relevant and is actually opposite to what the researcher found.
  Answer choice D is not relevant to the researcher's argument.
  Answer choice E can strengthen the argument as it shows that lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The researcher found that lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find a statement that supports the above conclusion.
  Choice B is relevant because if copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales, then the use of lichens to detect copper pollution can be extended to many other areas.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The researcher claims that lichens are as accurate as the best equipment available in monitoring air pollution.
  To strengthen the researcher's argument, we need to find an option that supports the accuracy and practicality of using lichens over expensive equipment.
  Option B is already mentioned in the context, and it supports the idea that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument, as the practicality of growing lichens in laboratories does not support the accuracy of using them as a cheaper alternative to expensive equipment.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument, as the presence or absence of mechanical monitoring devices does not support the accuracy of using lichens as a cheaper alternative to expensive equipment.
  Option C weakens the argument by suggesting that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal, which implies that they may not be effective in areas with high air pollution.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument, as the absorption of other air pollutants is not discussed in the context.
  Therefore, the most appropriate option that strengthens the researcher's argument is B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that lichens are as good or better than mechanical monitoring devices in other respects as well.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is consistent with the argument but does not strengthen it.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E is relevant because it suggests that lichens are effective at absorbing other pollutants in addition to copper, which would strengthen the argument that they can replace expensive monitoring devices.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The researcher argues that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to find a statement that supports the idea that lichens are reliable pollution indicators.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion
  D: appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute
  E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply
Response 0:

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that H pylori is not a commensal despite the fact that it allegedly strengthens the immune response and that stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring it.
  The argument compares this to M tuberculosis, which only causes sickness in about 10 percent of those who harbor it but is not considered a commensal.
  To undermine this reasoning, we need to find a statement that challenges the comparison made between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice A is irrelevant as it discusses the treatment of the diseases, which is not relevant to whether or not the bacteria are commensals.
  Choice B is also irrelevant as it discusses the duration of the diseases, which is not relevant to whether or not the bacteria are commensals.
  Choice C supports the argument that M tuberculosis is not a commensal but does not undermine the comparison made with H pylori.
  Choice D is also irrelevant as it discusses the number of people who harbor the bacteria, which is not relevant to whether or not the bacteria are commensals.
  Choice E undermines the comparison made in the argument by suggesting that there are more people who harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis, which could suggest that H pylori is more likely to be a commensal.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that just because only a small percentage of people get sick from H pylori, it does not mean that it is a commensal.
  The comparison is made with M tuberculosis, which also only causes illness in a small percentage of people.
  The argument assumes that H pylori does not provide any benefits to the body.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that H pylori provides some benefits to the body.
  Choice C suggests that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  If there is evidence that H pylori provides some benefits, then the argument's reasoning would be undermined.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal despite its strengthening of the immune response because it causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of those who harbor it, and M tuberculosis, which causes tuberculosis in less than 10% of those who harbor it, is not considered a commensal.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it compares the duration of tuberculosis to ulcers caused by H pylori, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that the presence of M tuberculosis does not benefit those who harbor it, making it more difficult to justify calling it a commensal.
  Choice D and E are also irrelevant because the number of people who harbor each bacterium does not address the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Therefore, the answer is C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that just because H pylori does not cause ulcers in all those who harbor it, it should not be considered a commensal.
  The argument also uses M tuberculosis as an example of a bacterium that causes disease in some people, despite being present in many more people.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to provide a reason why H pylori could still be considered a commensal despite not causing ulcers in all those who harbor it.
  Option C provides such a reason by stating that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence. If we can show that people who harbor H pylori do derive some benefit from its presence, then the argument's reasoning is undermined.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H. pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  To support this, it compares H. pylori to M. tuberculosis which is not considered a commensal despite the fact that only 10% of people get sick from it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that challenges the comparison between H. pylori and M. tuberculosis.
  A, B, and D are irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C is a statement that challenges the comparison between H. pylori and M. tuberculosis. If M. tuberculosis does not provide any benefit to the people who harbor it, then it is not comparable to H. pylori which is believed to strengthen the immune response.
  Therefore, the answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal despite its potential benefits and low rate of causing stomach ulcers, by drawing a comparison to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal despite its low rate of causing tuberculosis.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that shows that H pylori and M tuberculosis are not comparable in terms of their potential benefits or risks.
  A, B, C, and D are not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E suggests that H pylori is more common than M tuberculosis, but it does not address the issue of whether H pylori should be considered a commensal.
  Therefore, none of the choices seriously undermine the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
The argument is that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response since it plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. And the bacterium M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis, is not considered a commensal despite the fact that only about 10 percent of the people who harbor it get sick from it.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is also irrelevant to the argument.
Option C supports the argument because it implies that people who harbor M tuberculosis do not derive any benefit from its presence.
Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
Option E undermines the argument because it implies that more people benefit from the presence of H pylori than people who benefit from the presence of M tuberculosis.
Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the bacterium H pylori, which can cause stomach ulcers, is not a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response because only less than 10% of those who harbor it get sick from it and the same cannot be said for M tuberculosis.
  To undermine this argument's reasoning, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the characteristics of H pylori and M tuberculosis are not relevant to their classification as commensals.
  Answer choice A is not relevant to the argument and can be eliminated.
  Answer choice B is not relevant to the argument and can be eliminated.
  Answer choice C suggests that the presence of M tuberculosis does not benefit the person who harbors it, but this does not undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice D is not relevant to the argument and can be eliminated.
  Answer choice E suggests that more people harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis, but this does not undermine the argument's reasoning.
  None of the answer choices seem to undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above, and we need to select the most likely answer.
  Based on the information provided, the argument's reasoning seems sound, and there is no clear reason to undermine it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
The argument is that just because H pylori is present in most people without causing ulcers and allegedly strengthens the immune response, it should not be considered a commensal. The counterexample is that M tuberculosis is present in most people without causing tuberculosis, but no one considers it a commensal. We need to find an answer that undermines this reasoning.
A: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
B: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning. It implies that M tuberculosis is not a commensal because people who harbor it derive no benefit from its presence.
D: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning. If there are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis, then it is possible that H pylori is more likely to be a commensal than M tuberculosis. This statement suggests that the counterexample of M tuberculosis is not a fair comparison to H pylori because the situations are not equivalent.
The best answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
The argument is that just because H pylori allegedly strengthens the immune response and only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of people, it should not be considered a commensal. The counterexample is that only about 10% of people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it, yet it is not considered a commensal. 
To undermine this reasoning, we need to show that the situations are not comparable or that the counterexample is flawed.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  Choice A is irrelevant.
  Choice B is also irrelevant.
  Choice C shows that there is no benefit from the presence of M tuberculosis, which is different from the situation with H pylori. This undermines the reasoning that just because both bacteria cause illness in less than 10% of people, they should be treated the same.
  Choice D is irrelevant.
  Choice E is also irrelevant.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances, and they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  We need to find the option that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times. This could imply that the bear was not using its navigation skills and instead was relying on other senses or instincts.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This means that the bear could have been following a familiar path rather than using its navigational skills.
  Option C suggests that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice. This option does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option D suggests that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances. This option does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option E suggests that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory. This option does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option A seems to be the most plausible option that casts doubt on the validity of the evidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The evidence supporting the naturalists' claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  To cast doubt on the validity of this evidence, we need to find an answer choice that contradicts this evidence or shows that this evidence is not reliable.
  Answer choice A says that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, which implies that the polar bear did not navigate directly back to its home territory.
  Answer choice B says that the site where the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, which suggests that the polar bear was familiar with the area and may not have needed to navigate to return to its home territory.
  Answer choice C says that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, which does not necessarily contradict the evidence, but may make it less impressive since polar bears are adapted to live in such environments.
  Answer choice D says that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, which does not contradict the evidence, but weakens its significance.
  Answer choice E says that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, which does not contradict the evidence, but suggests an alternative explanation for how the polar bear found its way home.
  Answer choice A casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The naturalists' claim is that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered in support of the claim is an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We need to find an option that undermines the validity of the evidence.
  Option B provides an alternate explanation for how the polar bear navigated back to its home territory.
  If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it is possible that the polar bear was familiar with the area and was able to find its way back using its usual migration route, rather than navigating over considerable distances.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence to support this claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  We need to find an option that casts the most doubt on the validity of this evidence.
  Option A indicates that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times. This may indicate that the bear was not necessarily navigating but instead wandering around.
  Option B is irrelevant as being on the bear's annual migration route doesn't necessarily mean it can navigate over considerable distances.
  Option C is also irrelevant as the route consisting of primarily snow and drifting ice doesn't necessarily affect the bear's ability to navigate.
  Option D is also irrelevant as it doesn't negate the evidence presented.
  Option E also doesn't negate the evidence presented.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence cited is an instance of a polar bear returning to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We need to find an option that casts doubt on the validity of this evidence.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  This implies that the polar bear was not able to navigate directly to its home territory and had to change its path, casting doubt on the validity of the evidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence cited is an instance of a polar bear that returned home after being released 500 km away.
  We need to find the option that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  If the option shows that the polar bear did not use navigation but some other means to return home, that would cast doubt on the evidence.
  Option A shows that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times, indicating that it did not use navigation to return home.
  Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence cited is an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  In order to cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, we need to find an option that suggests that the polar bear did not navigate on its own.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  This implies that the polar bear did not navigate on its own and that it was probably searching for its home territory.
  Therefore, option A casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence they cite is an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We need to find an option that would cast doubt on the validity of this evidence.
  If the polar bear had some external help or if there was some other factor involved, then it can cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option B states that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  This suggests that the polar bear may have used its memory of the annual migration route to return home, rather than its navigation skills.
  Therefore, option B casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
   The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
   They cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
   We need to find the option that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
   Option A doesn't cast much doubt on the validity of the evidence.
   Option B supports the naturalist's claim.
   Option C doesn't cast much doubt on the validity of the evidence.
   Option D doesn't cast much doubt on the validity of the evidence.
   Option E doesn't cast much doubt on the validity of the evidence.
   Therefore, the answer is B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question asks for the answer that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  The evidence is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  If the evidence is invalid, it means that the polar bear did not actually return to its home territory.
  Therefore, the answer that casts the most doubt on the evidence would be the one that suggests the polar bear did not return to its home territory.
  Choice A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times, which would suggest that it did not actually return to its home territory.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
  The argument supports this conclusion with evidence that high-fther diets are negatively correlated with colon cancer incidence.
  The argument could be criticized for overlooking an alternative explanation for the correlation or for failing to consider other factors that could contribute to colon cancer incidence.
  Choice B suggests that high-fther diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer, but the argument only focuses on colon cancer.
  Choice C suggests that fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets, but this does not necessarily undermine the argument's conclusion.
  Choice D suggests that different sources of fther have different cancer-fighting properties, but this does not necessarily undermine the argument's conclusion either.
  Choice A and E are irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the best choice is B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that high-fiber diets can prevent colon cancer.
  It also provides evidence to support this claim.
  The question asks for a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning.
  The argument could be vulnerable if it overlooks other factors that contribute to colon cancer.
  Choice A suggests that the consumption of fiber is increasing, which could mean that colon cancer rates should be decreasing if the argument is correct.
  Choice B suggests that high-fiber diets might not be the only factor in reducing cancer risk.
  Choice C suggests that some people might not be able to eat enough fiber to prevent colon cancer.
  Choice D suggests that different types of fiber might have different cancer-fighting properties.
  Choice E suggests that fiber is not the only substance in food that can prevent colon cancer.
  The best answer seems to be D, as it suggests that the argument might oversimplify the relationship between fiber and colon cancer by treating all types of fiber as equally effective.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument states that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
  The argument also provides evidence that supports this claim.
  The question asks for a criticism of the argument.
  Therefore, the answer choice should be something that undermines the argument's claim.
  Answer choice B suggests that high-fther diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer, which goes against the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer.
  Therefore, B is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets reduce the incidence of colon cancer.
  It also provides evidence to support the claim.
  The question asks for a criticism of the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant. It does not address the claim that high-fiber diets reduce the incidence of colon cancer.
  Choice C is also irrelevant. It does not address the claim that high-fiber diets reduce the incidence of colon cancer.
  Choice D is also irrelevant. It does not address the claim that high-fiber diets reduce the incidence of colon cancer.
  Choice E is relevant because it suggests that other substances in high-fiber foods could be responsible for the reduction in colon cancer incidence, not the fiber itself.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument provides evidence from studies showing a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer in Western and non-Western countries and Scandinavia.
  The argument does not mention or address other factors that may contribute to colon cancer.
  Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism if it overlooks other factors.
  Looking at the choices, the most likely factor that the argument overlooks is the possibility that high-fiber diets may not be the only factor that contributes to colon cancer.
  Choice B is similar but not exactly the same as this possibility.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C is not mentioned in the argument and does not address the possibility of other factors.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E is plausible but not as likely as the possibility that high-fiber diets may not be the only factor that contributes to colon cancer.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fiber diets.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets reduce the incidence of colon cancer.
  The argument supports this claim with evidence that colon cancer rates are lower in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods and in Scandinavia where cereals consumption is high.
  The argument assumes that the correlation between high-fiber diets and low colon cancer rates is causal.
  The question asks for a criticism of the argument's reasoning.
  The answer choice that best criticizes the argument's reasoning is the one that points out a flaw in the argument's causal assumption.
  Answer choice B supports the argument's reasoning, not criticizes it.
  Answer choice C is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice D is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice E is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice A points out that the argument overlooks the possibility that the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably.
  This undermines the argument's assumption that the correlation between high-fiber diets and low colon cancer rates is causal, as rising fiber consumption may not be the cause of the observed decrease in colon cancer rates.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  It also states that the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in non-Western countries where people consume more fiber-rich foods.
  It concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it may overlook other factors that could be responsible for the difference in colon cancer rates.
  Choice A does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C may be a valid criticism, but it does not address the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice D may be a valid criticism, but it does not address the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice E may be a valid criticism because it suggests that other substances in foods containing fiber may be responsible for preventing colon cancer.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  It provides evidence that colon cancer rates are higher in Western countries with lower fiber diets.
  It also provides evidence that areas with lower cereal consumption have higher colon cancer rates.
  The argument concludes that insufficient fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient fiber prevents it.
  The question asks for a criticism of the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C is not a criticism of the argument's reasoning, but a potential obstacle to implementing the argument's recommendation.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E raises the possibility that other substances in fiber-containing foods, rather than fiber itself, may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, which is a criticism of the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument states that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  It also states that in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods, the incidence of colon cancer is lower.

  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if it overlooks other factors that may cause or prevent colon cancer.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument because it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
  Choice D is not a criticism of the argument because it does not contradict the argument's conclusion that fiber prevents colon cancer.
  Choice E is the most likely answer because it suggests that other substances in fiber-containing foods may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, not just fiber.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  It provides evidence from different countries to support the claim.

Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  However, it also states that their likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and the wild.
  Therefore, we need an answer that explains why the leatherbacks are not dying earlier in captivity from the fatal diseases.
  Choice (A) is irrelevant.
  Choice (B) is also irrelevant.
  Choice (C) does not explain why leatherbacks are not dying earlier in captivity.
  Choice (D) is also irrelevant.
  Choice (E) could help explain the apparent discrepancy if the size of a leatherback is not a reliable indicator of age. If a leatherback can be younger or older than its size suggests, then it is possible that the captive leatherbacks that are susceptible to fatal diseases are actually younger than their wild counterparts, and thus have not yet reached their maximum life expectancy.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity but they can still achieve their maximum life expectancy whether they are in captivity or in the wild. We need to find an option that can help resolve this discrepancy.
Option A does not help to resolve the discrepancy.
Option B provides information about the average life expectancy of sea turtles but it doesn't help to resolve the discrepancy.
Option C provides information about the cause of death for most leatherbacks in the wild but it doesn't help to resolve the discrepancy.
Option D is irrelevant to resolving the discrepancy.
Option E is also irrelevant to resolving the discrepancy.
Therefore, none of the options help to resolve the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The statement tells us that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not come in contact with if they lived in the wild.
  It also tells us that the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is the same whether it is living in captivity or in the wild.
  The discrepancy is that leatherbacks in captivity are more susceptible to fatal diseases, but their likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same as those in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need an option that explains how leatherbacks in captivity can still reach their maximum life expectancy despite being susceptible to fatal diseases.
  Option C tells us that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  This implies that fatal diseases are not the main cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild.
  Therefore, the statement implies that leatherbacks in captivity are more susceptible to diseases, but in the wild, they are more susceptible to predation.
  Thus, option C helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The statement tells us that captive and wild leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
  The passage also tells us that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to a variety of fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with if they lived in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases but still have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as wild leatherbacks.
  Choice A, B, C, and D do not explain how captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases but still have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as wild leatherbacks.
  Choice E does not explain how captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases but still have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as wild leatherbacks.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The apparent discrepancy is that leatherbacks living in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases, but they reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy at about the same rate as those living in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find the reason why the theoretical maximum life expectancy of leatherbacks is not significantly impacted by the fatal diseases they are susceptible to in captivity.
  Choice A, B, C, and D do not help to resolve the discrepancy.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild, yet the likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild. This is a discrepancy.
We need to find an answer that explains how the leatherbacks can be equally likely to reach their maximum life expectancy in both captivity and in the wild.
Option C provides a reason why the leatherbacks in the wild may not reach their maximum life expectancy. If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then it is possible that those that survive live as long as those in captivity. Therefore, option C helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The apparent discrepancy is that leatherbacks, when in captivity, are susceptible to fatal diseases they would never encounter in the wild, yet they still have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or the wild.
  The correct answer should help explain why leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or the wild despite the fatal diseases they encounter in captivity.
  Choice C is the most relevant because it suggests that the primary cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild is due to predators rather than diseases.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  However, the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether in captivity or in the wild.
  This suggests that something is balancing out the susceptibility to diseases in captivity.
  The correct answer should explain what that something is.
  Choice C provides a possible explanation, as most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is that despite the fact that leatherbacks are more susceptible to diseases in captivity, they still have the same chance of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those living in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a statement that explains why the life expectancy of captive leatherbacks is not significantly different from that of wild leatherbacks.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it doesn't explain why the life expectancy of captive leatherbacks is not significantly different from that of wild leatherbacks.
  Choice B is also irrelevant. Although it provides information about the life expectancy of sea turtles, it doesn't explain why the life expectancy of captive leatherbacks is not significantly different from that of wild leatherbacks.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it doesn't explain why the life expectancy of captive leatherbacks is not significantly different from that of wild leatherbacks.
  Choice D doesn't help resolve the discrepancy, but rather provides a reason why it might be difficult to keep leatherbacks in captivity.
  Choice E suggests that the size of a leatherback may not be an accurate indicator of its age, but this doesn't help explain the apparent discrepancy.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices help resolve the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild.
  Despite this, the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is about the same in captivity as it is in the wild.
  Therefore, something must be compensating for the increased risk of fatal diseases in captivity.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the increased risk of fatal diseases in captivity does not reduce the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its maximum life expectancy.
  Choice C states that most leatherbacks that die in the wild are killed by predators.
  This suggests that the fatal diseases that leatherbacks are susceptible to in captivity are not as significant a threat to their survival as predation is in the wild.
  Therefore, choice C is the best answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument states that halogen lamps from most major manufacturers are on display at Furniture Labyrinth and any item on display at Furniture Labyrinth is well crafted.
  A is not similar in reasoning because it talks about a causal relationship between storms and temperature drop.
  B is not similar in reasoning because it talks about a universal quantifier (everything Melinda writes is disturbing) and not a particular one.
  C is similar in reasoning because it talks about a particular quantifier (at least some good mechanical work) and the fact that every shop is capable of doing good mechanical work.
  D is not similar in reasoning because it talks about a general statement about the species of minnow and the health of fish in nearby lakes.
  E is not similar in reasoning because it talks about a universal quantifier (only healthful, organic ingredients are used) and not a particular one.

Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.

  The argument claims that since "Hero" has more than 50 percent of the sales in the market, it is dominant in the market and need only maintain its current market share to continue to dominate.
  However, the argument fails to consider the possibility that other companies may launch new products or change their marketing strategies to compete with "Hero," which could lead to a decline in "Hero's" market share.
  The argument assumes that the current market conditions will remain constant, which is not necessarily true.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and only needs to maintain its current market share to continue doing so.
  The argument uses a survey result that shows 72% of consumers believe "Hero" dominates the market.
  The argument then assumes that any product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market.
  However, the argument does not consider the possibility that there may be other products that have a significant market share.
  The argument is assuming that "Hero" is the only product in the market with such a high market share.
  This is an error in reasoning as the argument is mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  Therefore, the answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero" is the most popular carbonated drink product, and 72 percent of all consumers believe that it already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the current market share of "Hero" is sufficient to maintain market dominance in the future.
  However, the argument does not consider the possibility that other brands may be gaining popularity or that new competitors may enter the market.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument states that since "Hero" has more than 50% of the sales in the market, it is dominant.
  The argument ignores the possibility that another company might launch a new product that becomes more popular than "Hero" in the future. 
  The argument also assumes that the current market share of "Hero" will remain the same in the future.
  The argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  Therefore, the answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because its product, "Hero," is already dominant in the market according to the survey results.
  However, the argument does not consider the possibility that other competitors might enter the market, which could change the market share of each product.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may, in fact, be the cause of that condition.
  The answer is A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that "Hero" dominates the market because it has more than 50% of sales.
  The argument also cites survey results that show 72% of consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are accurate and that they will not change in the future.
  The argument also assumes that having more than 50% of sales is sufficient to guarantee dominance in the market.
  The argument does not seem to make any causal claims.
  The argument does not treat the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, already has over 50% of the sales in the market.
  The argument assumes that the current market share of "Hero" will remain constant in the future.
  The argument does not commit the error of mistaking a necessary condition for a sufficient condition or vice versa.
  The argument does not commit the error of treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true.
  The argument does not commit the error of taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  The argument commits the error of assuming that the survey results obtained in the past will hold true in the future.
  Therefore, the answer is E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of the consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the current market condition will remain the same in the future.
  However, market conditions are subject to change.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  The answer is D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the soft-drink market because more than 50% of the market sales are attributed to their product, "Hero."
  The argument ignores the possibility that the market share of "Hero" could decrease in the future.
  The argument assumes that the current market share of "Hero" will remain the same.
  The argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  Therefore, the answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and only needs to maintain its market share to continue to do so.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that "Hero" is already dominant in the market according to 72% of all consumers.
  However, the argument fails to consider that the market may change in the future, and competitors may arise that could challenge Harrold Foods' dominance.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find a statement that justifies the prediction.
  The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers. This statement does not justify the publisher's prediction.
  It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game. This statement does not justify the publisher's prediction.
  The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market. This statement is helpful, but it does not directly justify the publisher's prediction.
  Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward. This statement does not justify the publisher's prediction.
  Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend. This statement does not justify the publisher's prediction.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market. If the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market, it is more likely that sales of the game will exceed expectations. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The publisher's prediction is that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  The rebate is offered to renters who go on to purchase the game and saves them a significant portion of the purchase price.
  Rentals are exceeding expectations.
  Therefore, the justification for the publisher's prediction should be related to the rental and purchase of the game.
  If most players take a long time to complete the game, then they will likely rent the game multiple times before purchasing it, which will increase the rental rate and eventually increase sales.
  Therefore, the answer is B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports the publisher's prediction.
  The given context states that the game can be rented for two-day intervals and the publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  Therefore, an option that indicates the possibility of renters purchasing the game will support the prediction.
  Option A is already given in the context and does not give us any additional information.
  Option B is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option C is not enough to support the prediction.
  Option D is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  Therefore, none of the given options seem to support the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that provides a reason for the increase in sales.
  Option A is not relevant to the prediction.
  Option B is not relevant because it does not explain why sales will increase.
  Option C is not relevant to the prediction.
  Option D suggests that people will not play the game extensively after completing it, which could lead to lower sales, so it cannot be the answer.
  Option E suggests that some people may buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend. This may increase the popularity of the game and lead to more people buying it, thus justifying the publisher's prediction.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The publisher's prediction is that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  The game can be purchased or rented for two-day intervals.
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  Therefore, the justification for the prediction should be related to the rental and rebate policy.
  If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then they are likely to rent the game multiple times before purchasing it, thereby increasing sales.
  The answer is B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We are looking for a choice that helps to justify this prediction.
  The fact that the game can be purchased directly from the publisher or the retailers does not help to justify the prediction.
  The fact that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game does not help to justify the prediction either.
  The fact that the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market is a good point but it does not necessarily support the prediction.
  The fact that most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward does not help to justify the prediction.
  The fact that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend also does not help to justify the prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The publisher's prediction is that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. 
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  The rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations.
  To justify the publisher's prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea of more people buying the game.
  Option A doesn't help to justify the prediction.
  Option B doesn't provide any information about the number of people who will buy the game.
  Option C indicates the popularity of the publisher's games but doesn't provide any information about this specific game.
  Option D suggests that most players will not play the game extensively afterward, which doesn't help to justify the prediction.
  Option E doesn't help to justify the prediction either.
  Therefore, none of the options seem to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The game is available for purchase or rental.
  The publisher offers a rebate for renters who purchase the game.
  Rentals are exceeding expectations.
  Sales of the game are expected to exceed expectations soon.
  To justify the prediction, we need to find an option that supports that sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  Option B, that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, might indicate that people are more likely to purchase the game instead of renting it multiple times.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find the option that justifies the prediction.
  The game is available for purchase from retail outlets or rent for two-day intervals.
  Renters who go on to purchase the game are offered a rebate equal to the cost of one rental.
  The rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations.
  Therefore, we need an option that justifies the prediction that sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  Option B states that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  This option means that players may rent the game several times before completing it, which will increase rental sales.
  This option also means that players may have a greater attachment to the game after playing it for several weeks and may be more likely to purchase it.
  Therefore, option B helps to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The publisher's prediction is that sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  Sales are currently meeting expectations.
  Rentals are exceeding expectations.
  What about the game itself or the rebate offer could explain why the sales might exceed expectations in the future?
  If players take a long time to complete the game, they might be more likely to want to purchase it.
  If the publisher's games are popular, people might be more likely to purchase this one.
  If most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, they might be more likely to purchase it.
  If people who give the game away to a friend enjoyed it, their friend might be more likely to purchase it.
  The best answer choice will support the idea that the game will sell well in the future.
Action: Answer("B")  
The fact that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game implies that players will be invested in the game for a longer period of time, and may be more likely to purchase it after the rental period is over.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument above states that if the party's economic theories were sound and its program was implemented, the inflation rate would decrease. However, the inflation rate actually increased, which means the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The flawed reasoning is making an assumption about what would happen if a certain condition were met, but it is not considering other factors that could affect the outcome.
  Choice C has similar flawed reasoning. It assumes that if the company had sold its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase a new patent, the stock price would have doubled in the last two years. However, the stock price did not increase in that time, so the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This reasoning ignores other factors that could have affected the stock price.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that if the party's economic theories were sound and if it had implemented its program, then the inflation rate would have decreased.
  The argument then claims that because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were far off the mark.
  The reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the only reason the inflation rate increased was due to the party's economic theories being wrong.
  The answer choice that most closely resembles this flawed reasoning is C.
  Answer: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument assumes that if the party's economic theories were sound, then the inflation rate would have decreased.
  The argument concludes that the party's economic theories were far off the mark because the inflation rate actually increased.
  The flawed reasoning is that there may be other factors that caused the inflation rate to increase, and it may not be solely due to the party's economic theories being incorrect.
  Choice C is similar in that it assumes that the stock price not increasing was solely due to the company failing to sell its subsidiaries, without considering other factors.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
The argument above suggests that the party's economic theories were flawed because the inflation rate increased instead of decreasing under its program.
The reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories were sound, and the only reason the inflation rate increased was that the party failed to implement its program.
This is similar to option C, which assumes that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries because the stock price did not increase. This is a flawed assumption because other factors could have contributed to the stock price remaining the same.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that the party's economic theories were fur off the mark because the inflation rate actually increased.
  Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning is that the argument assumes a causal relationship between the party's economic theories and the inflation rate, when in fact, other factors may have contributed to the increase in inflation rate.
  Choice C is similar in that it assumes a causal relationship between the company's success in selling its subsidiaries and the increase in stock price, when in fact, other factors may have contributed to the stock price not increasing.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument above states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, inflation would have decreased. But since inflation increased, the theories were off the mark. This is a flawed reasoning of causality.
  Choice (C) is similar to the argument above in that it assumes a causal relationship between two events without sufficient evidence to support the conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument above uses conditional reasoning. 
  It assumes that if a certain condition is met, then a certain outcome will occur. 
  It concludes that because the expected outcome did not occur, the condition must not have been met. 
  Choice C uses similar reasoning, so it is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that if the party's economic theories had been sound, the inflation rate would have decreased, but it actually increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  Option C suggests that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  Both arguments present a hypothetical scenario that would have led to a certain outcome, but the outcome did not occur, so the initial hypothesis must be false.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument above suggests that the party's economic theories were fur off the mark because the inflation rate increased instead of decreasing.
  The argument assumes that the party's economic theories were sound, which may not be the case.
  The argument also assumes that the party had complete control over the economic policies and that external factors did not contribute to the inflation rate increase.
  Choice C has a similar flawed reasoning that assumes a causal relationship between two events without considering other factors that may have influenced them.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument above states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, inflation would have decreased. However, since inflation increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark. The argument conflates the party's economic theories with the actual implementation of those theories and assumes that the only reason for the failure was the unsound economic theories. 
  Choice C is similar in that it assumes that the only reason for the failure of the stock price to increase was the failure to sell its subsidiaries. It ignores other factors that could have affected the stock price.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Government official: Residents who are foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries. This is wise, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. So, ____.
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the government official's statement?
Choices:
  A: foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve
  B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries
  C: only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries
  D: foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries
  E: cabinet undersecretaries should not be expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries
Response 0:
Thought:
  The government official states that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries.
  The official explains that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  The official also explains that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, the official would most likely support a statement that is consistent with these two points.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument.
  Option B is inconsistent with the official's statement.
  Option C is not supported by the argument.
  Option D contradicts the official's statement that cabinet secretaries should be citizens.
  Option E is also inconsistent with the official's statement that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  The official provides two reasons for this: first, the duties of cabinet secretaries require that they be citizens; second, cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, the statement that most logically completes the argument must provide further support for the official's conclusion that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is a possible conclusion, but it does not logically complete the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D contradicts the official's argument.
  Choice E weakens the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  The reason is that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  Furthermore, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  So, the missing statement should logically complete the argument.
  The missing statement should be consistent with the argument.
  The missing statement should support the conclusion that foreign citizens cannot be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is too extreme and not supported by the argument.
  Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D is opposite to the argument.
  Option E contradicts what the government official said about the cabinet undersecretary's role.
  Therefore, none of the options is logically consistent with the argument.
  The answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The government official argues that there are some duties that only citizens should perform.
  Cabinet secretaries perform some of these duties.
  Therefore, foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  However, cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when necessary.
  Therefore, the statement should logically complete with an explanation of what should happen to cabinet undersecretaries who are foreign citizens.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument.
  Option B is not mentioned in the argument and is not relevant to the statement.
  Option C is not relevant and does not logically complete the statement.
  Option D contradicts the argument presented by the government official.
  Option E also contradicts the argument presented by the government official.
  The only option that logically completes the statement is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens cannot be appointed as cabinet secretaries because of some duties that only citizens should perform. 
  Moreover, cabinet undersecretaries are expected to perform the duties of cabinet secretaries when they are unavailable.
  Therefore, the statement should complete by emphasizing the importance of appointing citizens to positions that involve specific duties.
  The most suitable option is D, which suggests that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, except for cabinet secretaries, because these positions require performing some duties that should be done only by citizens.
  The official also mentions that a cabinet undersecretary should serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  The missing statement should logically complete the argument.
  Therefore, the statement that best completes the argument should support the idea that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  The correct answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The government official's argument is that foreign citizens cannot be appointed as cabinet secretaries because they perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens. 
  Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the official will argue that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries, because they would be expected to perform duties that should be performed only by citizens. 
  The best answer that completes the argument is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  According to the government official, foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels.
  But they cannot serve as cabinet secretaries because some duties of cabinet secretaries should only be performed by citizens.
  Also, cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, the statement needs to logically complete the argument.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument.
  Option B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Option C is not relevant to the argument.
  Option D contradicts the argument that some duties of cabinet secretaries should only be performed by citizens.
  Option E contradicts the argument that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, the most logical option is B which is not mentioned in the argument, but it supports the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The government official states that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries.
  Cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  No one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform.
  A cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  The statement needs to logically complete with a sentence that relates to the previous statements.
  If cabinet undersecretaries are not allowed to serve as cabinet secretaries, then this makes the statement about their role irrelevant.
  If foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries, then they should also not be expected to serve as cabinet secretaries.
  Therefore, the most logical statement that completes the government official's statement is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries since they perform some duties that only citizens can perform.
  Additionally, cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, if a foreign citizen is appointed as a cabinet undersecretary, they may end up performing duties that only citizens can perform.
  To maintain consistency with the official's argument, the statement that logically completes the argument should suggest that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
  The answer is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Figorian Wildlife Commission's position is that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that they have as much right to govern their own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is focused on the economic needs of Figoria and their right to govern their own resources.
  The principle that would most support the Figorian Development Commission's position would likely prioritize the economic needs of individual nations over the preservation of wildlife or regulation from international agreement.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate wetland development to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission wants to allow wetland development for growth.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position can be supported by a principle that allows Figoria to govern its own resources.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources and that wetland development is necessary for growth.
  Therefore, the principle that would most strongly support their position would be one that emphasizes the right of individual nations to govern their own resources and prioritize their economic needs.
  A, B, and D all emphasize the importance of regulating development to protect wildlife and prevent environmental damage, which goes against the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  C is a possibility, but it only calls for regulation after damage has already occurred, which does not align with the Figorian Development Commission's argument that development should be allowed.
  E is a possibility, but it is not a principle that would directly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Therefore, the most appropriate choice is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that development of wetlands must be regulated in order to protect wildlife, while the Figorian Development Commission argues that development is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources, which suggests that they would reject any argument that claims that Figoria should be subject to external regulation.
  Choice A argues for international regulation, which would be in conflict with the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice B argues that the preservation of wildlife is more important than economic needs, which would be in conflict with the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice C proposes a conditional approach to regulation, which would be in conflict with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, but is not directly relevant to the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice D argues that regulation must aim to prevent any further damage, which would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position but is not directly relevant to the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice E argues against further depletion of natural resources, which is not necessarily in conflict with the Figorian Development Commission's position, but does not directly support it.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered, as this directly contradicts the Figorian Development Commission's argument that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that they have as much right to govern their own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
  The principle that would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position is the one that asserts that a country has the right to govern its own resources.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands because it is necessary for growth and because they have the right to govern their own resources.
  If there were a principle that supported the idea that nations have the right to use their own resources as they see fit, that would support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice A would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, not the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice B argues for the preservation of wildlife, not for a nation's right to develop its own resources.
  Choice C would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, not the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice D argues that all nations should be held to the same standard of environmental protection, which would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice E argues against depletion of natural resources, which would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission supports wetland development and believes it won't affect wildlife.
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that wetland development has endangered many species and must be regulated.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  The principle that would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position is the one that supports a nation's right to govern its own resources.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission is arguing that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  This implies that they do not believe that national resources should be regulated by international agreement.
  Therefore, the principle that supports the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position is A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission is proposing that wetland development should be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that they have as much right to govern their own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that they should be allowed to develop their wetlands without any regulation that would hinder their growth.
  This is in contrast to the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position that development should be regulated to protect wildlife.
  To support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, we need to find a principle that supports the idea that Figorian wetland development should not be regulated to protect wildlife.
  Choice D is incorrect because it contradicts the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice E is also incorrect because it opposes the idea of further depletion of natural resources, which is not relevant to the argument between the two commissions.
  Choice A and B are incorrect because they support the idea of regulating wetland development to protect wildlife, which is opposite to the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice C is the only remaining answer choice and suggests that regulation should only be implemented after a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found. This principle would support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figorian wetland development is necessary for growth and that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats in order to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position would be most strongly supported by a principle that emphasizes a nation's right to govern its own resources over the need to protect wildlife.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of a nation's right to govern its own resources.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of protecting wildlife.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it addresses the issue of regulating national resources through international agreements, which is not the focus of the debate.
  Choice B contradicts the Figorian Development Commission's belief that wetland development is necessary for growth.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it only addresses the issue of regulating commercial development after a reduction in endangered species has been found, which is not the focus of the debate.

Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.

  Therefore, the answer is C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed because those who would be adversely affected are very influential.
If a democracy is well-functioning, it should represent the interests of the people who live in it.
If a democracy is not well-functioning, it may not represent the interests of the majority of people.
Therefore, the principle that best justifies the columnist's reasoning is that a well-functioning democracy will eventually pass a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights is unlikely to pass if it is opposed by influential people.
  The columnist is looking for a principle that supports their argument.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that the bill will not become law even though it is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights because those who would be adversely affected by it are very influential.
  The columnist suggests that the country is not a well-functioning democracy.
  The principle that best justifies the columnist's reasoning would be one that explains why the bill would not become law in a well-functioning democracy despite being favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that the fact that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights is not passed into law due to the opposition of influential people shows that the democracy is not well-functioning.
  The principle that best justifies the columnist's reasoning is that a well-functioning democracy will pass a bill that is favored by most people within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  Therefore, the answer is C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.

  The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights may not be passed into law if those who would be adversely affected are very influential.
  Option B provides a principle that supports the columnist's argument by stating that eventually, any bill favored by most people but opposed by influential people will pass into law if the democracy is well-functioning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and not violating basic human rights will not be passed into law because those who oppose it are influential.
  The columnist's reasoning implies that a democracy should pass bills favored by most people and not violating basic human rights, regardless of the opposition.
  Choice B most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning, stating that a well-functioning democracy will eventually pass a bill favored by most people but opposed by influential people.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed because the people who would be negatively affected are influential.
  The columnist claims that this shows the country is not a well-functioning democracy.
  The principle that best justifies the reasoning is that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  Therefore, the answer is C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
The columnist's argument is that a bill that most people favor and does not violate human rights may not be passed into law because of the influence of those who oppose it.
Option A is not valid as it says that any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights, which does not take into account the influence of those who oppose it.
Option B is not valid as it says that any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law in a well-functioning democracy, which is not the case in the scenario described by the columnist.
Option C is valid as it says that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential, which supports the columnist's argument.
Option D is not valid as it states that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights, which is not necessarily true in the scenario described by the columnist.
Option E is not valid as it says that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, which does not take into account the influence of those who oppose it.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is not inherently better than other possible configurations.
  The answer that strengthens this argument should support the idea that humans are content with different configurations of fingers.
  Choices A and B do not provide any information about the contentment of humans with different configurations.
  Choice C is an extreme statement and is not necessarily true.
  Choice D is in line with the biologist's argument but does not directly support it.
  Choice E provides evidence that there are fish species with six phalanges in their fins, which supports the idea that it is possible for humans to have six fingers.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that humans would be content with any configuration of fingers.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to show that humans are content with different configurations of fingers.
  Option A does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument.
  Option B contradicts the biologist's argument.
  Option C supports the biologist's argument but does not provide any evidence.
  Option D supports the biologist's argument but does not provide any evidence.
  Option E provides evidence that supports the biologist's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  The biologist argues that if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
  To strengthen the biologist's argument, we need a statement that supports the idea that human contentment with their finger configuration is not based on the number of phalanges but on something else.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is not supported by the biologist's argument.
  Option C is not supported by the biologist's argument.
  Option D supports the biologist's argument that our perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is based on our prejudices.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that humans would be just as content with six fingers if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer that supports the idea that the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not a determining factor in our contentment with it.
  Option A is irrelevant to the biologist's argument.
  Option B is too extreme and does not relate to the argument.
  Option C is similar to Option A and is also irrelevant.
  Option D supports the argument, but it is not the most relevant answer.
  Option E supports the idea that the configuration of fingers is not a determining factor in our contentment with it since we know at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
  Therefore, E is the best answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument is that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations such as having six fingers per hand.
  The biologist's argument would be strengthened if there was evidence that humans are content with different configurations of fingers or that the usefulness of our configuration is an illusion.
  Choices A, B, and C do not provide evidence to support the biologist's argument.
  Choice D provides some support for the biologist's argument but is not a strong enough statement to most strengthen the argument.
  Choice E, on the other hand, provides direct evidence that the configuration of having six phalanges in its fins exists in at least one species of fish.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, including six fingers per hand.
  To strengthen the biologist's argument, we need to provide evidence that supports the idea that the number of fingers on our hands is arbitrary.
  Option A does not address the argument.
  Option B is not relevant to the argument.
  Option C is not relevant to the argument.
  Option D supports the argument but does not provide new evidence.
  Option E supports the idea that there is a precedent for a fish with six phalanges in its fins, which strengthens the biologist's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that the configuration of fingers is not more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  The argument is also that if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to find a choice that supports the idea that humans would be content with a different configuration of fingers.
  Choice A is irrelevant because the argument is not about whether everyone is content with our present configuration of fingers.
  Choice B is a generalization that is not supported by the argument.
  Choice C is a generalization that is not supported by the argument.
  Choice D is the opposite of the biologist's argument.
  Choice E supports the idea that a fish with six phalanges in its fins existed, which strengthens the argument that humans would be content with a different configuration of fingers.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that humans could have been content with six fingers if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen the biologist's argument, we need to show that humans are content with things of equal usefulness.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B weakens the argument by suggesting that humans are never content with two things of unequal usefulness, which is not the biologist's argument.
  Choice C strengthens the argument by suggesting that humans are always content with two things of equal usefulness, which is consistent with the biologist's argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E is interesting, but it does not directly address the issue of human contentment with different configurations of fingers.
  Therefore, the best choice is C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that humans would be just as content with six fingers per hand if our fish ancestor had six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the number of fingers per hand is not tied to usefulness or that humans are content with more than one useful thing.
  Answer choice A does not strengthen the argument.
  Answer choice B weakens the argument, as it says that humans are never content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  Answer choice C is a generalization that is not relevant to the argument.
  Answer choice D supports the argument, but not as strongly as answer choice E.
  Answer choice E supports the argument by providing evidence that a fish species with six phalanges in its fins exists, which makes the scenario proposed by the biologist more plausible.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that humans would be just as content with six fingers if we had evolved from a fish with six phalanges.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to show that humans are not biased towards five fingers and are content with other configurations.
  Option A does not address this issue.
  Option B is not relevant to the argument.
  Option C is a general statement that does not address the issue of hand configuration.
  Option D supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of five fingers is biased.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely an actuary and not an accountant based on the assumption that an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the statement that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Option A weakens the argument by stating that the actuaries' activities were closely scrutinized, which makes it less likely for an actuary to have committed the crime.
  Option B weakens the argument by stating that there is evidence of breaches in computer security that could have given outsiders access to internal financial records.
  Option C weakens the argument by stating that there are eight accountants compared to only two actuaries, making it more likely for an accountant to have committed the crime.
  Option D weakens the argument by stating that an independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement, indicating that the embezzler could have been anyone.
  Option E is the only option that does not weaken the argument. It states that certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, which supports the detective's argument that it is more likely for an actuary to have committed the crime.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, so the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries.
  Option A provides additional evidence that the accountants were not involved.
  Option B suggests that someone outside the company could have committed the crime, which weakens the argument.
  Option C suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, which weakens the argument.
  Option D suggests that the company was vulnerable to embezzlement, which could mean that anyone could have committed the crime.
  Option E suggests that it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, which strengthens the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records. This weakens the detective's argument. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The detective argues that the embezzler is one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  To weaken this argument, we need to show that it is still possible for an accountant to have committed the crime.
  A, B, C, and D all provide alternative explanations for the embezzlement, but E does not.
  E is unrelated to the detective's argument and therefore does not weaken it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because of their specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, and that accountants would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  The correct answer should be the option that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Option A strengthens the argument by suggesting that the accountants were more closely scrutinized than the actuaries.
  Option B weakens the argument by suggesting that an outsider could have had access to the internal financial records.
  Option C weakens the argument by suggesting that there were more accountants than actuaries.
  Option D weakens the argument by suggesting that XYZ Corporation was already vulnerable to embezzlement.
  Option E weakens the argument by suggesting that the actuaries had less access to internal financial records than the accountants.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
The detective's argument rests on the premise that the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records. The detective also argues that an accountant would not have made the mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Therefore, the detective concludes that the embezzler is one of the actuaries. We need to find a choice that does not weaken the argument but rather strengthens it.
Choices A, B, C, and D all provide reasons why the detective's conclusion may be incorrect, whereas choice E does not. Therefore, the answer is E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The detective argues that the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, hence the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
  Any statement that contradicts the detective's argument or undermines the relationship between the embezzler's job and the crime would weaken the argument.
  Choice A suggests that the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than the accountants', making it less likely for the actuaries to commit the crime. This weakens the detective's argument.
  Choice B suggests that outsiders may have had access to the internal financial records, which weakens the assumption that the embezzler must have worked for XYZ Corporation. This weakens the detective's argument.
  Choice C implies that accountants are more likely to commit the crime as there are more of them. This weakens the detective's argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the detective's argument as it discusses a report released before the crime.
  Choice E implies that accountants are more likely to commit the crime as it is easier for them to access the records. This weakens the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above, as all choices except D weaken the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely an actuary because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the answer that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Options A, B, C, and D all present possible reasons why the detective's argument might be weakened.
  Option E suggests that the detective's argument is still valid, as it implies that actuaries might not have had easy access to internal financial records.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The detective's argument is based on the premise that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
  The correct answer will be a statement that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Let's evaluate each answer choice:
    A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized, it would make it less likely that one of them embezzled the money. This weakens the detective's argument. 
    B: If someone outside the company had access to internal financial records, then it is possible that the embezzler is not an accountant or an actuary. This weakens the detective's argument.
    C: The fact that there are more accountants than actuaries does not affect the detective's argument, since the argument is based on the assumption that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
    D: The fact that an independent report concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement does not affect the detective's argument, since the argument is based on the assumption that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
    E: If it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records, it would make it less likely that one of them embezzled the money. This weakens the detective's argument. 
  Answer choice C and D do not weaken the detective's argument. 
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because accountants would not make the mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the option that does not weaken the argument.
  Option A suggests that the activities of actuaries were more closely scrutinized, which strengthens the argument.
  Option B suggests that persons outside XYZ Corporation could have gained access to internal financial records, which weakens the argument by introducing an alternative possibility.
  Option C suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, which weakens the argument by suggesting that the embezzler could be one of the accountants.
  Option D suggests that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement, which weakens the argument by suggesting that it could have been someone outside the corporation.
  Option E suggests that it was more difficult for actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for accountants, which weakens the argument by suggesting that it could have been an accountant who had access.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The detective argues that the embezzler is one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the option that does not weaken the detective's argument.

Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone.
  B: I have no reason to think that the practical joke I want to play would harm anyone. So, since the joke would show no contempt for the person the joke is played on, it would not be wrong for me to play it.
  C: Because of the circumstances, it would be wrong for me to play the practical joke I had intended to play on you. Even though it would not show contempt for anyone, it could easily bring you significant harm.
  D: It would have been wrong for me to play the practical joke that I had intended to play on you. Even though I did not have reason to think that it would significantly harm anyone, I did think that it would show contempt for someone.
  E: Someone was harmed as a result of my practical joke. Thus, even though it did not show contempt for the person I played the joke on, I should not have played it.

  Option A follows the principle and acknowledges that the practical joke might bring significant harm to someone, so it would be wrong to play it.
  Option B argues that the practical joke would not bring harm and would not show contempt, but it does not follow the principle.
  Option C acknowledges that the practical joke would not show contempt but could bring significant harm, so it would be wrong to play it.
  Option D acknowledges that the practical joke would show contempt, so it would be wrong to play it.
  Option E acknowledges that someone was harmed as a result of the practical joke, so it would be wrong to play it.
  Therefore, the argument that best justifies the principle stated above is option A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The principle stated above states that one should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
  Choice A acknowledges that playing a practical joke could be harmful to someone.

  The principle states that one should not play a practical joke if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
  We need to find an argument that justifies the principle above.
  Option A agrees with the principle and admits that the joke would bring significant harm to someone.
  Option B argues that the joke would not harm anyone and would not show contempt, which does not justify the principle.
  Option C agrees with the principle and admits that the joke could bring significant harm to someone.
  Option D agrees with the principle and admits that the joke would show contempt for someone.
  Option E agrees with the principle and admits that someone was harmed as a result of the prank.
  Therefore, the best answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The principle stated in the context is that one should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
  The argument that best justifies this principle is the one that aligns with this principle.
  In option A, the argument aligns with the principle as the person realizes that the joke would bring significant harm.
  In option B, the argument is not justifiable as the person is not considering the principle stated in the context.
  In option C, the argument aligns with the principle as the person realizes that the joke could easily bring significant harm to someone.
  In option D, the argument aligns with the principle as the person realizes that the joke would show contempt for someone.
  In option E, the argument is not justifiable as the person is not considering the principle stated in the context.
  Therefore, the answer is D: It would have been wrong for me to play the practical joke that I had intended to play on you. Even though I did not have reason to think that it would significantly harm anyone, I did think that it would show contempt for someone.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The principle is that one should not play a practical joke on someone if:
  - It shows contempt for that person
  - One believes it might bring significant harm to that person
  Choice A: The reasoning aligns with the principle stated above. The person recognizes that the practical joke would bring significant harm to someone, and therefore, it was wrong to play it.
  Choice B: The reasoning does not align with the principle stated above. The person assumes that since the practical joke would show no contempt for the person, it would not be wrong to play it.
  Choice C: The reasoning aligns with the principle stated above. The person acknowledges that even though the practical joke would not show contempt for anyone, it could easily bring significant harm to the person.
  Choice D: The reasoning aligns with the principle stated above. The person admits that the practical joke would show contempt for someone, and therefore, it would be wrong to play it.
  Choice E: The reasoning does not align with the principle stated above. The person recognizes that someone was harmed as a result of the practical joke, but the principle states that one should not play a practical joke if it might bring significant harm to that person.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The principle stated above says that practical jokes that show contempt for someone or might bring significant harm to them are wrong.
  Choice A acknowledges that the practical joke would bring significant harm to someone, and that is why it would be wrong to play it.
  Choice B does not address the potential harm of the practical joke, and only considers whether the joke shows contempt.
  Choice C acknowledges that the practical joke could bring significant harm to someone, and that is why it would be wrong to play it.
  Choice D acknowledges that the practical joke shows contempt for someone, and that is why it would be wrong to play it.
  Choice E acknowledges that someone was harmed by the practical joke, which goes against the principle stated above.
  The argument that best justifies the principle is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The principle states that one should not show contempt for someone or play a practical joke that might bring significant harm to that person.
  Option A acknowledges that even if the joke was not contemptuous, it would still be wrong to play it if it would bring significant harm to someone.
  Option B does not consider the principle stated above as it only considers whether there is a reason to believe that the joke would harm someone or not.
  Option C acknowledges that it would be wrong to play the practical joke even though it would not show contempt for anyone if it could bring significant harm to someone.
  Option D acknowledges that it would be wrong to play the practical joke if it showed contempt for someone even if there was no reason to believe that it would bring significant harm to someone.
  Option E acknowledges that the practical joke should not have been played as someone was harmed as a result of it.
  Option A best justifies the reasoning based on the principle stated above.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

Thought:
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it.
  However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  We need to find the option that provides a difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Options A and B do not provide a difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option C provides a cost difference between producing an hour of film and an hour of television, but it does not explain why the primary goals of movie and television executives are different.
  Option D provides a difference between the way movie and television shows make their profits. This could be a reason why the goals of movie and television executives are different.
  Option E does not provide any difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film in order to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  We need to find a statement that explains the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Choice A does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Choice B talks about the profits of owners of movie theaters but does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Choice C compares the costs of producing an hour of film to the costs of producing an hour of television but does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Choice D explains that sponsors are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show, which could explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Choice E does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:

  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  We need to find a statement that helps explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option A does not help explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option B is irrelevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option C does not help explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option D provides a possible explanation for the difference in goals. Sponsors are concerned with the purchasing power of people who watch a TV show, not the number of viewers. 
  Option E does not help explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  We need to find the option that helps to explain the difference in their goals.
Action: Answer("D") 
Reasoning:
  Option A is irrelevant to the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option B talks about the profits of theater owners, which is not related to the goals of movie or television executives.
  Option C is also not relevant. The cost of producing a film or a TV show is not related to the goals of their respective executives.
  Option D is the most relevant answer. It says that the profits of television shows come from sponsors who are concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a TV show. This explains why television executives are more concerned with the demographics of their viewers than the total number of viewers, unlike movie executives.
  Option E is not relevant to the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film, which is necessary to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it.
  However, the primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  We need to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Option A does not explain the difference in goals.
  Option B talks about the profit made by owners of movie theaters that is not relevant to the goals of movie executives and television executives.
  Option C talks about the cost of producing films and television shows, which is not relevant to the goals of movie executives and television executives.
  Option D suggests the profit made by television shows from sponsors, who are concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. This explains why television executives aim to maximize the purchasing power of the viewers and not necessarily the number of viewers.
  Option E talks about the most popular television shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch, which is not relevant to the goals of movie executives and television executives.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:

  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  To explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives, we need to find an option that shows a difference between movies and television.
  Option A is irrelevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option B talks about the profits of movie theaters, which is not relevant to the goals of movie executives.
  Option C talks about the cost of producing films and television shows, but it does not explain why the goals are different.
  Option D is relevant because it talks about the profits made by television shows, which is different from the profits made by movies.
  Option E is irrelevant because it talks about the popularity of television shows, but it does not explain why the goals are different.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  We need to find a choice that explains this difference.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the goals of the executives.
  Choice B talks about movie theaters and owners, which is not relevant to the executives.
  Choice C talks about the cost of producing a film and television show, but it is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Choice D talks about the profits of television shows and their sponsors, but it does not explain why the goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  Choice E states that over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch. This implies that television shows make their profits from sources other than ticket sales. Hence, the primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows, but to maximize the profits from other sources such as sponsors.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:

  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  We are looking for an option that justifies the difference in goals.
  Option A is irrelevant because the frequency of watching is not related to the goals.
  Option B is also irrelevant because it talks about profit-making by selling refreshments.
  Option C does not justify the difference in goals, but highlights the difference in the average cost of producing an hour of film and an hour of television.
  Option D is a probable reason for the difference in goals because sponsors are concerned with the purchasing power of the audience, which is more important than the number of viewers.
  Option E is irrelevant because it talks about the popularity of TV shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

The principles state that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if they could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Option A: Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. Therefore, he should not be blamed for it.
Option B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting her brother take out a loan to expand his business would cause the business to go bankrupt. Therefore, she should not be blamed for it.
Option C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill. However, he was concerned that it might. Therefore, he should be blamed for it.
Option D: Dr. Fitzpatrick was not aware that the wrong medicine would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
Option E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, which any reasonable person could have foreseen would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.
Option A and B follow the principles and justify the reasoning. Option C, D, and E do not follow the principles. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Option A describes a situation where the person did not foresee the misfortune, so it could potentially justify the reasoning.
  Option B describes a situation where the person had no idea that their action could cause misfortune and could not have foreseen it, so it could potentially justify the reasoning.
  Option C describes a situation where the person had no reason to think that their action could cause misfortune, but they were concerned that it might, so it does not justify the reasoning.
  Option D describes a situation where the person did not know that their action would cause misfortune, so it could potentially justify the reasoning.
  Option E describes a situation where any reasonable person could have foreseen the misfortune, so it does not justify the reasoning.
  
Therefore, the principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in Option B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it. 

Action: Answer("B")

  The principle states that a person should not be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if they could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Choice A describes a situation in which Riley did not think about the potential consequences of parking his car in the center lane of Main Street. Thus, if a traffic accident does result, Riley should not be blamed for it.
  Choice B describes a scenario in which Oblicek had no idea that suggesting a loan to her brother would cause his business to go bankrupt and could not have reasonably foreseen it. Therefore, she should not be blamed if it does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt.
  Choice C describes a situation in which Gougon was concerned that serving hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, but he had no reason to think it would. Therefore, if the sauce does make his guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  Choice D describes a scenario in which Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know that giving his patient the wrong medicine would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, if no one else knowingly contributed to the patient's increased blood pressure, only Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  Choice E describes a situation in which any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp should be blamed for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.
  The only choice that aligns with the principle stated in the context is B.
Action: Answer("B")

The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it. 
Option A: Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. If he could not have reasonably foreseen this, he should not be blamed for it.
Option B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. If she could not have reasonably foreseen this, she should not be blamed for it.
Option C: Gougon was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill. If he could not have reasonably foreseen this, he should not be blamed for it.
Option D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave the wrong medicine to his patient, but he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. If he could not have reasonably foreseen this, he should not be blamed for it.
Option E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, which any reasonable person could have foreseen would start a fire. Therefore, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.
The option that justifies the principle is Option B. Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries, which makes trial by jury unfair for cases that involve scientific or technical issues.
  To weaken this argument, we need to show that there are other factors that make trial by jury fair in such cases.
  Choice A supports the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony.
  Choice B weakens the argument by suggesting that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced, which implies that excluding them may actually make the trial more fair. 
  Choice C is irrelevant because it suggests an alternative that is not being considered in the argument.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it discusses the behavior of expert witnesses, which is not related to the fairness of trial by jury.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it discusses the cost of expert witnesses, which is not related to the fairness of trial by jury.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum indicates that it is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  To weaken this argument, we need to show that the presence of biomarkers does not necessarily indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the geologist's argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E weakens the geologist's argument by suggesting that carbon deposits can be formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that petroleum must have been formed from the remains of living organisms because of the presence of biomarkers.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that shows that the presence of biomarkers doesn't necessarily mean that petroleum came from living organisms.
  Choice A does not weaken the geologist's argument since the existence of fossils without biomarkers does not disprove the argument that petroleum comes from living organisms.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not address the issue of petroleum formation.
  Choice C might strengthen the argument, as it supports the idea that petroleum came from living organisms that existed millions of years ago.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument, as it does not address the issue of petroleum formation.
  Choice E weakens the geologist's argument, as it provides another possible source of petroleum.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum was formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  The opposing scientists argue that petroleum was formed from deep carbon deposits.

  We need to find an option that makes the presence of biomarkers less likely.
  Option A does not impact the geologist's argument.
  Option B is irrelevant.
  Option C supports the opposing scientists' theory.
  Option D is irrelevant.
  Option E supports the geologist's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum refutes the theory that it formed from deep carbon deposits.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that challenges the link between the presence of biomarkers and the formation of petroleum from living material.
  Option A is irrelevant because we are not discussing fossils but petroleum.
  Option B does not have any impact on the formation of petroleum.
  Option C supports the geologist's argument that the formation of petroleum from deep carbon deposits would take many millions of years.
  Option D is also irrelevant because the argument is about the formation of petroleum, not bacteria.
  Option E provides an alternative way for carbon deposits to form from the fossilized remains of plants, which weakens the geologist's argument that petroleum could not form from living material.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust.

  We need to find the statement that weakens the geologist's argument.
  If the presence of biomarkers in petroleum can be explained without the need for living organisms, then the geologist's argument can be weakened.
  Option A does not weaken the argument because it does not address the issue of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Option B is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of the formation of petroleum.
  Option C actually strengthens the argument because it suggests that it would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  Option D is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of the formation of petroleum.
  Option E is the best answer because it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which weakens the argument that petroleum only formed from the remains of animals and not plants.

Response 5:
Thought: 
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  The theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits is refuted by the presence of biomarkers.
  To weaken the geologist's argument, we need to show that biomarkers could be present in petroleum that did not form from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  Choice A weakens the argument by showing that fossils can lack biomarkers.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C strengthens the argument by suggesting that it would take a long time for organisms to become petroleum.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E weakens the argument by suggesting that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The geologist claims that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum indicates that it was formed from living organisms.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  We need to find an option that shows that biomarkers could exist in petroleum even if it wasn't formed from living organisms.
  Option A talks about fossils that are devoid of biomarkers, but it doesn't explain how that weakens the geologist's argument.
  Option B talks about when living organisms emerged, but it doesn't explain how that weakens the geologist's argument either.
  Option C supports the geologist's argument by suggesting that it would take millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which would weaken the argument that petroleum is only formed from living organisms.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers refutes the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the geologist's claim.

Action: Answer("A")  
Response 8:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum indicates that it was formed from the fossilized remains of living organisms.
  To weaken this argument, we need to show that the presence of biomarkers doesn't necessarily indicate the presence of living organisms.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B doesn't affect the argument because the geologist is not arguing that petroleum was formed after the emergence of living organisms.
  Choice C supports the geologist's argument, so it doesn't weaken it.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E weakens the geologist's argument because it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, not from living organisms.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")

  However, biomarkers have been found in petroleum, indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
  We need to find a statement that weakens the argument that biomarkers indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
  Choice A does not address the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C does not weaken the argument that biomarkers indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E could weaken the argument if it is true that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants and not from living organisms.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they have an immunity to that microorganism.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is equivalent to immunity.
  Therefore, we need to find an answer choice that has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Answer choice C is similar because it assumes that the absence of medication implies that Isabel is still ill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The student's argument is based on the fact that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, and concludes that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  However, not developing any harmful symptoms does not necessarily mean that they have an immunity to the microorganism.
  This pattern of reasoning is similar to the one in which the conclusion is based on invalid assumptions.
  Option C is also based on invalid assumptions, as the conclusion is drawn from a single premise.
  Option B is also similar, as the conclusion is drawn based on the fact that writers of fiction are not advertisers, which does not necessarily mean that they never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  Option A is not similar, as it is based on the idea of moral rightness, not immunity to a microorganism.
  Option D is not similar, as it is based on the idea of taxation and business expansions, not immunity to a microorganism.
  Option E is not similar, as it is based on the idea of hand washing and disease prevention, not immunity to a microorganism.
  The best answer is either B or C, but since option C has a flawed pattern of reasoning similar to the student's argument, the answer is C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, they have immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  But, it is possible that these people are not immune to the microorganism and that the microorganism does not cause them harm for other reasons.
  Therefore, the student's argument is flawed.
  The pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is most similar to option C.
  Isabel is still quite ill, so she did not take the medication, but there could be other reasons for her illness.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The student argues that if people are not affected by harmful symptoms of a microorganism, then they have immunity to that microorganism.
  The argument is flawed because some people may not develop symptoms because of other factors, such as a strong immune system.
  Therefore, we are looking for an answer that is flawed in its pattern of reasoning.
  Answer choices B, C, and E are not similar to the student's argument.
  Answer choice D is flawed because it assumes a direct causal relationship between excessive taxation and business expansion, without considering other factors that may affect business owners' willingness to expand their businesses.
  Answer choice A is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to answer choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The student argues that because many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  However, the argument is flawed since the premise does not guarantee the conclusion.
  The argument has a flawed pattern of reasoning.
  We need to find an answer choice that has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Answer choice A states that some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone based on the premise that everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just.
  This argument is also flawed since the premise does not guarantee the conclusion.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to answer choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The student concludes that people have immunity to staphylococcus because many people are exposed to it without developing harmful symptoms.
  The student assumes that if people don't develop harmful symptoms, then they have immunity to the microorganism.
  The argument is flawed because many people can be exposed to a microorganism without developing symptoms but not necessarily have immunity to it.
  There is a flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument.
  Answer choice D is the closest in its flawed pattern of reasoning because the argument assumes that the decline in business expansions is caused by excessive taxation without considering other factors that may contribute to it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  The argument is flawed because not all people who are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in which choice?
  Choice A is about morality and justice, and the argument is flawed because not all morally right actions serve the interests of everyone. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice B is about persuasion and advertising, and the argument is flawed because not all writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice C is about medication and illness, and the argument is flawed because not all medication cures disease or alleviates its symptoms. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice D is about taxes and business expansions, and the argument is flawed because the recent decline in business expansions may not necessarily be due to excessive taxation. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice E is about handwashing and disease prevention, and the argument is flawed because the fact that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals does not mean that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  None of the choices is similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The student concludes that many people have immunity to staphylococcus because they are exposed to it without developing harmful symptoms.
  The argument assumes that exposure to staphylococcus does not cause harmful symptoms in people who have immunity to it.
  The argument does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes a causal relationship without providing any evidence to support it.
  Choice A is also flawed because it assumes a causal relationship without providing any evidence to support it.
  Choice B is flawed because it makes an unwarranted assumption about the goals of fiction writers.
  Choice C is flawed because it assumes that medication must cure disease or alleviate its symptoms.
  Choice D is flawed because it assumes a causal relationship without providing any evidence to support it.
  Choice E is flawed because it assumes that doctors are the only health care professionals who can prevent disease.
  The argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The student assumes that the exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms indicates the presence of immunity.
  This is similar to assuming that because people's moral actions do not serve the interests of everyone, then those actions are not just.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The student argues that if a person has an immunity to staphylococcus, then they do not develop harmful symptoms.
  The student concludes that people who are exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms have immunity to the microorganism.
  The student's argument is flawed because they assume that everyone who is exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms has immunity to the microorganism, which may not necessarily be true.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is similar to that of answer choice C.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The journalist's argument is that the critique by the physician who is employed by the company that manufactures the drug does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
  The argument assumes that the critique is biased because of the physician's employment, but this assumption may not be true in all cases.

  The argument may be criticized on the grounds that it takes for granted that anyone associated with the company making the drug is unable to weigh evidence concerning the drug's side effects.
  The argument may also be criticized on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that the author of the book may be biased for personal reasons.
  The answer may be A, C, D, or E. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The journalist's argument is that the critique of the book is not legitimate because the physician who criticized it is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  This argument assumes that the physician is biased and therefore unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning the drug's side effects.
  This assumption is vulnerable to criticism.
  The journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it takes for granted that anyone associated with a drug company is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The conflict presented is that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain, but the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas, while food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans.
  Option A is irrelevant to the apparent conflict presented.
  Option B is also not relevant to the apparent conflict presented.
  Option C suggests that the apparent conflict may not be valid as prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today. This could help resolve the conflict.
  Option D is irrelevant to the apparent conflict presented.
  Option E does not help to resolve the apparent conflict presented.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The apparent conflict is that early humans needed a high-calorie diet with adequate fats to evolve their brain, but the evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  The conflict can be resolved by identifying a reason why early humans did not need to evolve their brain while living in shore environments despite having a high-calorie diet.
  Option A talks about the metabolic rate, which does not directly answer the question.
  Option B talks about the size of the brain, which is not relevant to the conflict.
  Option C talks about the reliability of resources, which is not relevant to the conflict.
  Option D talks about the techniques used to explore archaeology, which is not relevant to the conflict.
  Option E explains why early humans did not need to evolve their brain while living in shore environments despite having a high-calorie diet.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage states that early humans required a high-calorie diet with adequate fats to evolve the anatomically modern human brain.
  The passage also states that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in shore environments.
  However, the evolution of the human brain took place in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this apparent conflict, we need to identify a statement that can reconcile these two facts.
  Choice E states that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. This implies that early humans may have expended more energy gathering food in shore environments, even though the food was high in calories and fat.
  Therefore, choice E would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage states that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain, and that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments.
  However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  The apparent conflict is that the food resources that could support the evolution of the human brain were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments, but the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve the conflict, we need to find an answer that explains why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas, despite the fact that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments.
  Choice E suggests that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
  This would explain why early humans did not evolve their brains in shore environments, despite the abundance of food resources that could support such a diet.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The apparent conflict is that the evolution of the human brain, which required a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats, took place in savanna and woodland areas, whereas the most abundant and reliable food resources that could support such a diet were available in shore environments.
  Option A is irrelevant as it talks about the metabolic rate, not the food resources.
  Option B is also irrelevant as it talks about the size of the brain, not the food resources.
  Option C seems to be the most relevant, as it states that prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today, which could explain why early humans preferred to evolve their brains in these environments.
  Option D is irrelevant as it talks about the techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites, not the food resources.
  Option E is also irrelevant as it talks about the expenditure of calories, not the food resources.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage states that high-calorie diets were available in shore environments, but the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas.
  Option E, if true, would explain why early humans did not evolve in shore environments despite the availability of high-calorie diets.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was crucial for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain, and that the food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in shore environments. However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas. 
  To resolve this apparent conflict, we need to find an option that can explain why the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundant food resources in shore environments.
  Option A doesn't explain why the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundant food resources in shore environments.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C doesn't explain why the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundant food resources in shore environments.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E suggests that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. This could explain why early humans didn't evolve their brains in the shore environments, despite the abundant food resources. They might have chosen savanna and woodland areas as it was easier to gather food there without expending much energy.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The apparent conflict is that the evolution of the human brain required a high-calorie diet provided by shore environments, but the evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find information that explains why the brain's evolution was not limited to shore environments.
  Choice A is irrelevant as it talks about metabolic rate, which is not related to the conflict.
  Choice B is also not helpful as it talks about the size of the brain, which is not related to the conflict.
  Choice C is not helpful as it talks about the abundance of resources, which is not related to the conflict.
  Choice D is not helpful as it talks about the techniques used to explore prehistoric shore sites, which is not related to the conflict.
  Choice E provides a possible explanation as to why the brain's evolution was not limited to shore environments.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The conflict is that the food resources that could support a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats were most abundant and reliable in shore environments, but the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  Option E, stating that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments, would help to resolve the conflict by suggesting that although shore environments offered abundant and reliable food resources, gathering food in these environments was not energy-efficient, and therefore, savanna and woodland areas were more suitable for the human brain's evolution.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question asks for the answer that would best resolve the conflict presented in the passage.
  The conflict is that the evolution of the human brain required a high-calorie diet that was most abundant and reliable in shore environments, but the evolution of the human brain took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The study found that workers with the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need to find a choice that best explains why workers with the least control over their own work had a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Choice A is incorrect because it does not explain why workers with the least control over their own work had a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Choice B is incorrect because it does not provide any evidence that feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  Choice C is incorrect because it does not provide any evidence that the keyboards on which office workers type promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Choice D is incorrect because it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards, which is not relevant to the study.
  Choice E is the most likely answer because it provides an alternative explanation for why workers with the most control over their own work had a lower risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. If they perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work, then their hands and wrists may be more accustomed to repetitive motions and less susceptible to developing carpal tunnel syndrome from typing.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The study found that workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  The question asks for the option that explains the study's findings.
  Option A is incorrect because it suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work. This option does not explain why office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Option B is a possible explanation for the study's findings. If feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders, then it could explain why office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Option C is incorrect because it suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This option does not explain why office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Option D is incorrect because it suggests that among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.

  Option E is incorrect because it suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This option does not explain why office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Option B is the best answer because it provides a possible explanation for the study's findings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need to find an option that helps to explain why workers who reported the least control had a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome than those who reported the most control.
  Option A, D, and E are irrelevant to the study findings.
  Option C suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. However, it does not explain why workers who reported the least control over their work had a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome than those who reported the most control.
  Option B suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This option explains why workers who reported the least control over their work had a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome than those who reported the most control.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.

Thought:
The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
We need to find the option that provides an explanation for the study's findings.
Option A is irrelevant as it talks about the amount of typing done by workers with more or less control, but the study says that both groups do similar amounts of typing.
Option B is a possible explanation as stress can make one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
Option C is irrelevant as it talks about the position of arms and hands but the study is about the level of control over work.
Option D is irrelevant as it talks about workers who rarely use keyboards, but the study is about workers who do similar amounts of typing.
Option E is a possible explanation as repetitive motions other than typing can cause carpal tunnel syndrome.

Action: Answer("B") or Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need to find an option that explains why workers with less control over their work had much higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option A is irrelevant to the study.
  Option B is about emotional stress which is not related to carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option C is about the keyboards which is not helpful in explaining the study's findings.
  Option D is about office workers who rarely use keyboards which is not relevant to the study.
  Option E explains that workers with the least control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than those who reported the most control. This suggests that the workers with less control over their work may be subject to more repetitive motions overall, leading to a higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need an answer that explains why workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument uses a pattern of reasoning where Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, said that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. The concert did not sell out. Therefore, it can be concluded that the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  Option A uses a similar pattern of reasoning where Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. The patient did not survive the surgery. Therefore, it can be concluded that the surgery was probably not properly performed.
  Option B uses an "if-then" statement to conclude that the sample is not labeled correctly since it probably does not contain any organic compounds. This is not similar to the pattern of reasoning in the argument.
  Option C uses a similar pattern of reasoning where the neighbor, who is an experienced renovator, said that the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. The damage is still noticeable. Therefore, it can be concluded that the repair to the wall was probably not properly done.
  Option D uses a similar pattern of reasoning where the builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking, and there have been no major storms. Therefore, it can be concluded that the builder was probably wrong.
  Option E uses a similar pattern of reasoning where Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. The tests did find lead in the soil. Therefore, it can be concluded that the tests were probably properly conducted.
  
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument presents a scenario where an expert in the field of concert promotion predicts the outcome of a concert based on the promotion. The concert does not sell out, suggesting that it was poorly promoted. 
  A is similar in that a doctor predicts the outcome of a heart transplant based on the skill of the surgeon. The patient does not survive, suggesting that the surgery was not properly performed. 
  B is not similar because it presents a scenario where an expert predicts the contents of a sample based on their knowledge of organic chemistry, and then draws a conclusion based on that prediction. 
  C is not similar because it presents a scenario where an expert predicts the outcome of a repair based on their experience, and then draws a conclusion based on the outcome of the repair. 
  D is not similar because it presents a scenario where a builder predicts the longevity of a roof based on whether it is damaged in a storm, and then draws a conclusion based on the roof leaking. 
  E is not similar because it presents a scenario where an expert predicts the outcome of a test based on whether it was properly conducted, and then draws a conclusion based on the test results. 
  Therefore, the answer is A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. The concert did not sell out. Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  Option B seems to follow a similar pattern of reasoning. Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  Both arguments rely on the expertise of a knowledgeable person and use the probability of an outcome to draw a conclusion about the cause of the outcome.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  The argument is based on the opinion of an expert in the field and the observation that the expected outcome did not occur.
  Answer choice A is similar to the argument above because it is based on the opinion of an expert and the observation that the expected outcome did not occur.
  Answer choice B is not similar to the argument above because it is based on a conditional statement and not the opinion of an expert.
  Answer choice C is not similar to the argument above because it assumes that the neighbor's opinion is correct without any evidence to support it.
  Answer choice D is not similar to the argument above because it assumes that the builder's statement is incorrect without any evidence to support it.
  Answer choice E is not similar to the argument above because it assumes that the expert's opinion is correct without any evidence to support it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. 
  However, the concert did not sell out, so it was probably not properly promoted.
  The reasoning is based on the premise that if the concert was properly promoted, it would sell out.
  Therefore, the answer should be similar in that it draws a conclusion based on a premise that something would happen if certain conditions were met.
  Option A is similar in that Dr. Smith concludes that the surgery was not properly performed based on the premise that the patient would survive if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon.
  Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
The argument presents a knowledgeable person's prediction, which is then contrasted with what actually happened. 
The argument concludes that the prediction was probably incorrect because the event did not happen as predicted. 
Option A presents a similar pattern of reasoning where a prediction is made by an expert, which is then contrasted with what actually happened. 
In option A, the expert's prediction is that the patient would survive if the surgery was properly performed. The patient did not survive, so the expert's prediction was probably incorrect.
Therefore, the answer is A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument presents Wells' opinion that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out, so it was probably not properly promoted.
  The pattern of reasoning is based on a conditional statement and the negation of the consequent.
  The argument is similar to option C, where the neighbor's opinion is used to make a prediction about the quality of the wall repair.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument presents an expert opinion that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out, so it was probably not properly promoted.
  The correct answer choice should present a similar pattern of reasoning.
  Answer choice A presents a similar pattern of reasoning where an expert opinion is presented, and the opposite result occurs, leading to the conclusion that the procedure was not properly performed.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that Wells was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out, implying it was probably poorly promoted.
  The pattern of reasoning involves predicting an outcome based on a condition, and then inferring whether the condition was met based on the outcome.
  Option A involves predicting survival based on the surgeon's skill, and then inferring whether the surgery was properly performed based on the outcome.
  Option B involves predicting the presence of organic compounds based on labeling, and then inferring whether the labeling was correct based on the outcome.
  Option C involves predicting the absence of damage based on proper repair, and then inferring whether the repair was properly done based on the outcome.
  Option D involves predicting the absence of roof damage based on the builder's statement, and then inferring whether the statement was correct based on the outcome.
  Option E involves predicting the presence of lead based on proper tests, and then inferring whether the tests were properly conducted based on the outcome.
  The pattern of reasoning in option A is most similar to that in the argument above.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument states that Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, believed the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. 
  The concert did not sell out. 
  The conclusion is that the concert was probably not properly promoted. 
  Answer choice A has a similar pattern of reasoning, where Dr. Smith, a cardiologist, said that the patient would probably survive if the surgery was performed by a highly skilled surgeon. 
  The patient did not survive the surgery. 
  The conclusion is that the surgery was probably not properly performed. 
  Both arguments use an expert opinion to make a prediction, which is then used to draw a conclusion.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument for freedom of thought fails because intellectual progress requires intellectual discipline.
  The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
  A: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument presented by the professor.
  B: This answer choice is also irrelevant to the argument presented by the professor.
  C: This answer choice is incorrect because it contradicts the argument presented by the professor.
  D: This answer choice is also irrelevant to the argument presented by the professor.
  E: This answer choice supports the argument presented by the professor. It suggests that intellectual discipline is necessary for freedom of thought.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The conclusion drawn by the professor is that the argument for freedom of thought fails.
  The professor argues that intellectual discipline is needed to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas, which is necessary for intellectual progress.
  Therefore, the assumption that would support the professor's conclusion is that intellectual discipline is more important than freedom of thought for intellectual progress.
  Choice E seems to best capture this assumption.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The professor argues that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress and that intellectual discipline is also needed to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if one of the answer choices is assumed.
  Answer choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Answer choice B is not necessary to the argument.
  Answer choice C is contrary to the argument.
  Answer choice D is not relevant to the argument.
  Answer choice E supports the argument that intellectual discipline is necessary for freedom of thought.
  Therefore, the assumption that must be made for the professor's conclusion to follow logically is that "Without intellectual discipline, thinkers cannot mine the full implications of interrelated ideas."
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The professor argues that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress because it needs intellectual discipline.
  So, there must be an assumption that supports the idea that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress.
  Option A talks about a hindrance to intellectual progress but doesn't mention anything about intellectual discipline.
  Option B talks about the context of society but doesn't mention anything about intellectual discipline.
  Option C contradicts the argument of the professor.
  Option D talks about creativity but doesn't mention anything about intellectual discipline.
  Option E supports the argument of the professor that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress.
  Therefore, the assumption that supports the professor's argument is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument presented is that freedom of thought alone cannot lead to intellectual progress.
  Intellectual discipline is required to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if one of the options is assumed.
  Option A states that thinkers who limit their line of thought are hindered in intellectual progress, but this is not related to the conclusion drawn.
  Option B is not related to the conclusion.
  Option C states that thinkers who have freedom of thought lack intellectual discipline, which is opposite to the argument presented, so this option is not related to the conclusion.
  Option D states that freedom of thought engenders creativity, which can aid the discovery of truth, but this does not address the argument presented.
  Option E states that without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought, which supports the argument presented.
  Therefore, the conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if we assume that without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought. 
  The answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress.
  Intellectual progress requires intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  The conclusion is that the argument for freedom of thought fails.
  The assumption that would make the conclusion follow logically is that freedom of thought alone does not provide intellectual discipline.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument presented is that freedom of thought is necessary for intellectual progress, but intellectual discipline is also necessary.
  The conclusion is that the argument for freedom of thought fails.
  Therefore, the assumption required for the conclusion is that the argument for intellectual discipline is stronger than the argument for freedom of thought.
  The assumption is not about the other choices.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The professor argues that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress because thinkers also need intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas. 
  The conclusion follows logically if it is assumed that intellectual discipline is necessary for mining the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument in the passage states that freedom of thought is not enough to make intellectual progress since thinkers also need intellectual discipline.
  Therefore, the conclusion drawn by the professor is that the argument for freedom of thought fails.
  The assumption that would make this conclusion logical is that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress.
  Choice A is not related to the conclusion drawn by the professor.
  Choice B is not related to intellectual discipline or the conclusion drawn by the professor.
  Choice C contradicts the argument in the passage that freedom of thought is not enough to make intellectual progress.
  Choice D is not related to intellectual discipline or the conclusion drawn by the professor.
  Therefore, the assumption that would make the conclusion logical is that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is that freedom of thought is not sufficient for intellectual progress because intellectual discipline is also necessary.
  The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if one of the assumptions is true.
  If A, B, C, or D were true, then it would not necessarily follow that the argument fails.
  However, if E were true, then it would be impossible to have freedom of thought without intellectual discipline, which supports the argument that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument discusses the feeding behavior of Diplodocus.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The argument is based on the fact that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented the movement required to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  An assumption required by the argument would be something that connects the neck structure of Diplodocus to its feeding behavior.
  Option A is irrelevant.
  Option B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Option C is not relevant to the argument.
  Option D is the opposite of what the argument concluded.
  Option E is a possibility but it is not required by the argument.
  Therefore, there is no assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that Diplodocus's neck structure prevented it from raising its neck to reach high vegetation.
  However, it had the ability to bend downward and extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  The assumption required by the argument would be a statement that links the evidence provided to the conclusion.
  Choice A, B, C, and E are not related to the argument.
  Choice D is a possibility, but the argument does not rely on it.
  Therefore, none of the choices is the assumption required by the argument.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument discusses the feeding behavior of Diplodocus.
  The computer models show that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  However, Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument should be related to the feeding behavior of Diplodocus.
  The argument does not mention any other animals with the same type of neck structure.
  The argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's vision or its brain.
  The argument does not discuss any other ways Diplodocus could access high-growing vegetation.
  The argument mentions that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land, but it does not discuss any other ways Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation.
  The only assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus's neck structure determines its feeding behavior.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that computer models have shown that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument also states that Diplodocus's neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing it to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  The conclusion is that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  Therefore, an assumption required by the argument would be that there were no other ways for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation.
  Choice D states that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs, which is consistent with the assumption.
  The answer is D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument talks about how the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones limits its movement to raise its neck.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument is something that must be true in order for the conclusion to follow from the premises.
  Option A is not an assumption required by the argument.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C is not related to the argument.
  Option D is the opposite of what the argument concludes.
  Option E is a possibility that does not affect the conclusion.
  Therefore, none of the options are assumptions required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument discusses the feeding behavior of Diplodocus.
  The computer models have shown that the neck bones of Diplodocus would have prevented the dinosaur from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Instead, the neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument should help to connect the evidence provided by the computer models to the conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D suggests an alternative way for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation, which is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice E contradicts the argument, which states that Diplodocus could access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  Therefore, none of the choices is an assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater because computer models suggest that its neck structure would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  To support this conclusion, an assumption is needed.
  The assumption must be something that connects the neck structure of Diplodocus to its feeding behavior.
  Choice A, B, C, and E are not related to the neck structure of Diplodocus and its feeding behavior.
  Choice D is related to the feeding behavior of Diplodocus but it is not necessary to assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that the neck structure of Diplodocus is the primary factor that determines its feeding behavior.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to eat high-growing vegetation.
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and even extend below ground level.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  To reach this conclusion, the argument must assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument is that computer models have shown that Diplodocus's neck bones could not have allowed it to raise its neck and feed on high-growing vegetation.
  Instead, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  An assumption required by the argument must be something that is necessary to connect the evidence (computer models) to the conclusion (Diplodocus's feeding habits).
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is not mentioned in the argument and is irrelevant.
  Choice D is incorrect because it contradicts the argument; the argument says that Diplodocus could feed on underwater vegetation, so it had another way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, none of the choices are assumptions required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The argument is based on the fact that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation but could bend downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  An assumption required by the argument is that there were no other ways for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation.
  Choice D suggests that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation such as by rising up on its hind legs, which is consistent with the argument.

  This argument is flawed because there could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise.
  Choice A is similar in that the argument suggests that not paying rent is the only reason for owning a house.
  This argument is flawed because there could be other reasons why someone owns a house.
  Therefore, the answer is A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument above assumes that receiving a poor performance evaluation is the only reason not to receive a raise.
  This is similar to option B, which assumes that owning a house is the only reason not to pay rent on it.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he did not receive a raise.
  The argument assumes that the only reason someone does not receive a raise is because of poor performance evaluation.
  The argument fails to consider the possibility that there may be other reasons why someone does not receive a raise.
  Answer choice A is flawed in a similar way because it assumes that the only reason someone pays rent on a house is that they do not own it.
  Therefore, the answer is A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument is flawed because it overlooks the possibility that Lester may not have received either a raise or a poor performance evaluation.
  Choice A presents a similar flawed reasoning by concluding that since the next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that the neighbors could both own the house and pay rent on it, for example, if they rented a room to someone else.
  Therefore, the answer is A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the premise that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  The argument then concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  This is a flawed reasoning because there may be reasons other than a poor performance evaluation that explain why Lester did not receive a raise.
  Choice A is similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument because it makes a conclusion based on an incomplete premise.
  In Choice A, the premise is that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, but the conclusion assumes that since the neighbors pay rent on their house, they do not own it.
  This is flawed reasoning because there may be other reasons why the neighbors pay rent on their house, such as renting it out to someone else.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument above concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise.
  This conclusion is based on the premise that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  The reasoning is flawed because the conclusion does not logically follow from the given premise.
  Choice A is similar to the argument above because it concludes that the next-door neighbors do not own their house because they pay rent on it.
  This conclusion is based on the premise that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it.
  The reasoning is flawed because the conclusion does not logically follow from the given premise.
  Therefore, the answer is A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument in the context above says that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation. This is a flawed reasoning because there can be other reasons for not receiving a raise.
  Similarly, in option B, the argument says that since my next-door neighbors own their house, it must be that they do not pay rent on it. This is flawed reasoning because owning a house and paying rent on it are not mutually exclusive.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Lester has received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise, which is flawed reasoning.
  The correct reasoning would be: No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester has not received a raise, but that does not necessarily mean he has received a poor performance evaluation. He may have received neither a raise nor a poor performance evaluation.
  Choice A is similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
  Choice A concludes that the next-door neighbors do not own their house because they pay rent on it, but that is not necessarily true. They may own their house and still pay rent on it.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if it is made in jest.
  The argument that justifies the principle should involve an offer that is not legitimate.
  Option A discusses a legitimate offer, so it is not the answer.
  Option B states that the offer was not legitimate because it was made in jest.
  Option C discusses a legitimate offer, so it is not the answer.
  Option D discusses a legitimate offer that was made in such a way that it would not be believed to be made in jest.
  Option E discusses an offer that was not legitimate, but the reason for it is not clear.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
- The principle states that a legitimate offer must be accepted to form a valid contract.
- An offer is not legitimate if it is made in jest and a reasonable person would believe it to be so.
- The argument that justifies the above principle is the one that shows an illegitimate offer cannot form a valid contract.
- Choice B shows that an offer made in jest is not legitimate and thus cannot form a valid contract.
- Therefore, the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A only mentions a legitimate offer and the fact that there has been no rejection, but it does not relate to the principle mentioned.
  Option B relates to the principle mentioned, where the offer was not legitimate as it was made in jest, which invalidates the contract.
  Option C only mentions a legitimate offer, but it does not relate to the principle mentioned.
  Option D relates to the principle mentioned, where the offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, which validates the contract.
  Option E only mentions an illegitimate offer, but it does not relate to the principle mentioned.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The principle states that an offer is legitimate only if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in earnest.
Option A is correct as it states that if Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer, there was a valid contract. This aligns with the principle stated above.
Option B is also correct as Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus made the offer in jest, which means the contract was not valid. This also aligns with the principle.
Option C is incorrect as it states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate, and thus Mindy will accept the offer if she is a reasonable person. But, the principle states that the offer is legitimate only if it is believed to be made in earnest.
Option D is correct as it states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. This aligns with the principle.
Option E is incorrect as it states that Sal made an illegitimate offer to Veronica and thus no valid contract between them. However, the principle states that an offer is illegitimate only if it is believed to be made in jest.
Therefore, the answer is either A, B, or D. Option A and B both align with the principle, but Option B is a more accurate application of the principle. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
The principle stated above says that a legitimate offer must be accepted for a contract to be valid, and an offer is not legitimate if it is made in jest and someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Option A only talks about the legitimate offer and acceptance of the offer, but does not address the issue of jest.
Option B is the correct answer because it talks about an offer made in jest, which is not a legitimate offer and therefore does not result in a valid contract.
Option C only talks about a legitimate offer but does not address the issue of jest.
Option D talks about an offer that is not made in jest, but it does not address the issue of whether the offer is legitimate or not.
Option E talks about a non-legitimate offer, but it does not address the issue of jest.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
The principle explains that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest. 

A. This argument assumes that Joe's offer was legitimate and Sandy has not rejected the offer. It does not address whether Sandy believed the offer was made in jest or not.

B. This argument is relevant because it states that Kenta accepted Gus's offer, but Gus made the offer in jest. Therefore, the contract was not valid.

C. This argument assumes that Frank's offer was legitimate and that Mindy is a reasonable person who will accept the offer. It does not address whether Mindy believed the offer was made in jest or not.

D. This argument explains that Hai's offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.

E. This argument assumes that Sal's offer was not legitimate. It does not address whether Veronica believed the offer was made in jest or not.

Therefore, the answer is D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A does not provide enough information to determine the legitimacy of the offer.
  Option B aligns with the principle stated above.
  Option C assumes that Mindy will accept Frank's offer.
  Option D aligns with the principle stated above.
  Option E assumes that there was no legitimate offer made.
  The best answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A talks about a legitimate offer that has not been rejected, but it does not address whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option B talks about an offer that was made in jest, which makes the contract not valid. This aligns with the principle stated above.
  Option C talks about a legitimate offer, but it does not address whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option D talks about an offer that was made in such a way that it would not be believed to be made in jest. This aligns with the principle stated above.
  Option E talks about an offer that was not legitimate. This aligns with the principle stated above.
  Therefore, the principle most helps to justify the reasoning in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The answer choice that most accurately reflects this principle is B.
  In choice B, Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus made the offer in jest, and thus the contract was not valid.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
The principle stated in the context mentions that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Option A mentions that Joe made a legitimate offer to Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. This option does not relate to the principle stated in the context.
Option B mentions that Gus made the offer to Kenta in jest, and hence the contract was not valid. This option aligns with the principle stated in the context.
Option C mentions that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business is legitimate, and Mindy should accept the offer if she is reasonable. This option does not relate to the principle stated in the context.
Option D mentions that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, and if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. This option aligns with the principle stated in the context.
Option E mentions that the only offer Sal made to Veronica was not legitimate, and hence there is no valid contract between them. This option does not relate to the principle stated in the context.
Thus, options B and D align with the principle stated in the context.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. 
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that shows stretching before jogging does help to prevent injuries.
  Option E suggests that stretching can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from exercise, which is somewhat relevant.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  The argument is based on the premise that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  The question asks for a statement that would weaken the argument.
  If a statement weakens the argument, it would mean that stretching before jogging might help to prevent injuries.
  Option A provides additional information, but it does not weaken the researcher's argument.
  Option B talks about the difficulty that some of the joggers experienced while stretching. It does not weaken the researcher's argument.
  Option C provides information that most jogging injuries result from mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little or no effect. This supports the researcher's argument.
  Option D suggests that the more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging. This does not weaken the researcher's argument.
  Option E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise. This statement weakens the researcher's argument by suggesting that stretching may not prevent injuries, but it could reduce the severity of injuries.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The medical researcher concluded that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries based on the fact that both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  To weaken this argument, we need to provide evidence that suggests stretching may have an effect on preventing injuries.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B suggests that the joggers who have difficulty performing stretches may be more prone to injury, but it does not necessarily suggest that stretching before jogging helps to prevent injuries.
  Option C supports the medical researcher's argument by suggesting that most jogging injuries result from mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little or no effect.
  Option D suggests that joggers who are more prone to injuries are more likely to stretch before jogging, which would support the medical researcher's argument.
  Option E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise, which weakens the medical researcher's argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries.
  We need to find a statement that weakens this argument.
  If we find a statement that shows that stretching does help prevent injuries, then it would weaken the argument.
  Choice E states that stretching can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
  This suggests that stretching can be beneficial and can help prevent injuries.
  Therefore, choice E would most weaken the medical researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The researcher concludes that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries based on the comparison of two groups of joggers.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that shows that the comparison was not done properly or that stretching might have helped prevent injuries.
  If stretching helps prevent injuries for other exercises, it could help prevent injuries while jogging as well.
  So, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find a statement that weakens this argument.
  If we can find evidence that stretching is related to preventing injuries, it would weaken the argument.
  Choice E provides evidence that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries, which weakens the researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A states that the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries for both groups of joggers compared by the scientists.
  If this is true, it means that the study groups were less prone to injuries than the general population of joggers.
  This weakens the researcher's argument because it suggests that stretching may have helped to prevent injuries in both groups.
  Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find a statement that contradicts the researcher's argument.
  Option A talks about the rate of jogging injuries and is not relevant to the argument.
  Option B talks about the difficulty experienced by previously injured joggers and is not relevant to the argument.
  Option C talks about the cause of jogging injuries and is not relevant to the argument.
  Option D states that joggers who are more prone to jogging injuries are more likely to perform stretches before jogging. This suggests that the habit of performing stretches is not the cause of jogging injuries.
  Option E states that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise. This weakens the researcher's argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The medical researcher claims that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries.
  We need to find a statement that weakens this argument.
  If we can show that stretching before jogging has some benefits, then the researcher's argument will be weakened.
  Option E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
  This implies that stretching could still be beneficial for joggers.
  Therefore, option E is the answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The medical researcher concluded that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries.
  We need to find a statement that contradicts the researcher's conclusion.
  Statement A is not related to the conclusion.
  Statement B is also not related to the conclusion.
  Statement C supports the researcher's conclusion.
  Statement D is not related to the conclusion.
  Statement E contradicts the researcher's conclusion by stating that stretching before exercise can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
  Therefore, the answer is E.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class, based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class while most of the psychology majors are not.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning here is that the argument assumes that "most" implies "more" which is not necessarily true.
  Choice B exhibits a similar flawed pattern of reasoning by assuming that "more" implies a majority, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class while most of the psychology majors are not.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because of the possibility that the total number of psychology majors might be much smaller than the total number of sociology majors.
  Choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning by assuming that most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks based on the fact that more residents said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than on parks.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class, but most of the psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is not necessarily true, as it is possible that there are more psychology majors than sociology majors overall, but a smaller percentage of psychology majors chose to take the class.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning is one that draws a conclusion based on a percentage of a group without considering the size of the group itself.
  Choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning, as it draws a conclusion based on a percentage of respondents to an opinion poll without considering the total number of residents in Silver Falls.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class, but most of the psychology majors are not. This conclusion is flawed as it does not account for the total number of students enrolled in the class.
Option B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning as it concludes that most Silver Falls residents are in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks based on the premise that more residents said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than parks in an opinion poll. This conclusion is flawed as it assumes that the opinion poll is representative of the entire population of Silver Falls.
Option C is not similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above as it concludes that there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species in the San Felipe area based on the premise that most of the trees in the San Felipe city arboretum are of local rather than exotic species. This conclusion is not flawed as it is a reasonable inference based on the premise.
Option A, D, and E are also not similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above as they draw a reasonable conclusion based on the premise.
Therefore, the best answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class because most of the sociology majors are taking the class, but most of the psychology majors are not.
  The argument ignores the possibility that there may be more psychology majors enrolled in the class than sociology majors even though most psychology majors are not taking the class.
  Choice B is similar in that it assumes that just because more people are in favor of spending more on roads than parks, most people are in favor of spending more on roads.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that the proportion of majors in the class is the same as the proportion of majors in the university, which may not be the case.
  Choice B is similar in that it assumes that the proportion of residents who are in favor of increased spending on roads is the same as the proportion of residents who are in favor of increased spending on parks, which may not be the case.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there are more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is not necessarily true, as it is possible that there are simply more sociology majors overall than psychology majors overall.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is similar to that in answer choice B, where the conclusion is drawn based on a comparison of two groups without considering the possibility of other groups or factors that may affect the outcome.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument assumes that sociology majors are the majority of the class.
  It assumes that psychology majors are the minority of the class.
  It concludes that there are more sociology majors than psychology majors in the class.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that only sociology majors take Introduction to Social Psychology, which may not be true.
  The argument is similar to the flawed reasoning in option B, where a conclusion is drawn based on a poll without considering other factors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not. This conclusion cannot be drawn because there could be fewer students overall in the psychology major than in the sociology major. 
Option B is similar to the given argument because it also draws a conclusion about the majority of a group based on a poll that does not give information about the size of the groups.
Option C is not similar to the given argument because it draws a conclusion about the number of trees of a particular species in an area based on the fact that most trees in the arboretum are of that species.
Option A is not similar to the given argument because it draws a conclusion about the ownership of twentieth-century paintings based on the fact that most of the paintings on display are from the twentieth century.
Option D is not similar to the given argument because it draws a conclusion about the availability of organic vegetables at two different stores based on the fact that one store has more organic vegetables available than the other.
Option E is not similar to the given argument because it draws a conclusion about the number of houses and condominiums for sale based on the fact that the website has more photos of houses than of condominiums.
Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  The argument assumes that the number of students in each major is equal, which is a flawed pattern of reasoning.
  The answer is similar to an argument that makes a conclusion based on an unsupported assumption.
  Option B is a similar flawed pattern of reasoning as it makes a conclusion based on an opinion poll that may not represent the entire population.

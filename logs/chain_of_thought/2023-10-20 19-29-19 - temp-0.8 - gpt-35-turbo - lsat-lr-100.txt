### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The advertisement is based on a study that divided blindfolded volunteers into five groups.
  Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas.
  Most volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The conclusion is that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
  Choice A: The advertisement does not overlook the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups. It already divided volunteers into five groups for testing. Therefore, choice A can be eliminated.
  Choice B: The advertisement does not take for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted. It only concludes that most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. Therefore, choice B can be eliminated.
  Choice C: The advertisement overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. This is a valid criticism as there could be a cola not tested in the study that would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. Therefore, the answer is C.
  Choice D: The advertisement overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste. This is a valid criticism, but not the most vulnerable to the argument in the advertisement. Therefore, choice D can be eliminated.
  Choice E: The advertisement does not suggest that it elicits consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas. Therefore, choice E can be eliminated.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The study only tested on five different colas.
  The volunteers were divided into five groups, each group tasting a different cola.
  The study only shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than the five competing colas tested.
  The study does not take into account other factors that might influence a consumer's purchasing decision.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the advertisement's reasoning.
  Choice B is not a vulnerability to the advertisement's reasoning.
  Choice C is a possibility, but it does not directly address the advertisement's reasoning.
  Choice D is relevant because it identifies a factor that might influence a consumer's purchasing decision.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it does not address the advertisement's reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The advertisement is based on a study that tested blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas.
  Most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The advertisement concludes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  The reasoning is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it overlooks an alternative explanation that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  Therefore, the answer is D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  However, the advertisement conducted the study on blindfolded volunteers only.
  The advertisement does not consider the price range of Sparkle Cola.
  The advertisement also overlooks the possibility that factors other than taste, such as packaging or price, may influence the choice of consumers.
  The advertisement also overlooks the possibility that there may be other colas not tested in the study that could elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  Choice A, B, C, D, and E all raise valid criticisms of the advertisement.
  However, Choice A is the most vulnerable to criticism as it points out the possibility that the generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the other five colas tasted.
  However, it is possible that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the basis of possible bias resulting from the small sample size.
  Choice A accurately reflects this criticism.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  The study was conducted on blindfolded volunteers.
  The volunteers were divided into five groups, each tasting a different cola.
  Most volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola over the other colas tasted.
  The advertisement assumes that the preference for Sparkle Cola would translate into actual purchasing behavior.
  The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
  
  A: This is a possible criticism, but the advertisement explicitly states that volunteers were divided evenly into five groups, so it is unlikely that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  
  B: This is a possible criticism, but it is not the most vulnerable. The advertisement does not take for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted. It merely states that most volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola over the other colas tasted.
  
  C: This is a possible criticism, but it is not the most vulnerable. The advertisement does not overlook the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. It merely states that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  
  D: This is the most vulnerable criticism. The advertisement overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  
  E: This is not a relevant criticism since the advertisement is only concerned with consumers' responses to colas.
  
  Therefore, the answer is D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  
  Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted in the study.
  The preference of the volunteers may not be generalizable to the entire population.
  Some factors that were not tested in the study, such as price, packaging or other colas, may have influenced the preference of the volunteers.
  The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste, which is option D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  This conclusion may be limited for a variety of reasons.
  Choice A points out that the study groups may not be representative of the entire population.
  Choice B alludes to the possibility of other factors influencing consumer behavior.
  Choice C suggests that there may be a different cola not tested that consumers prefer.
  Choice D suggests that other factors such as packaging and price may influence consumer preference.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the study's conclusion.
  The best answer is D as it provides a plausible alternative explanation for the study's findings.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the other colas tasted.
  The study did not test all possible colas, leading to the possibility that others may be preferred.
  The advertisement assumes that the preferences of the volunteers are reflective of consumer preferences.
  The advertisement does not address whether the preferences were influenced by factors other than taste, such as pricing or packaging.
  The wording of the advertisement suggests that all volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds of D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing colas tasted.
  The study used blindfolded volunteers divided evenly into five groups.
  However, there are criticisms that the advertisement is vulnerable to.
  Choice A is relevant to the study's division of volunteers but does not criticize the reasoning.
  Choice B is not relevant to the study results but rather to the price of Sparkle Cola compared to other colas.
  Choice C raises a possibility that the study does not address, but it is not a criticism of the reasoning.
  Choice D is a possible criticism since the advertisement does not specify why the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola.
  Choice E is not relevant to the reasoning as it does not address the study's actual results.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is based on conditional statements and causal reasoning.
  The conclusion is based on the assumption that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The correct answer should follow a similar pattern of reasoning.
  Option A is not similar because it uses a different causation.
  Option C is not similar because it suggests a different solution.
  Option D is similar to the argument but not exactly the same.
  Option E also introduces a different causal factor.
  Option B is similar to the argument because it makes a causal claim based on a conditional statement.
  The conclusion in both cases is based on a conditional premise that may not be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument above assumes that squirrels only eat from an uncovered bird feeder.
  It concludes that if a bird feeder doesn't have a protective cover, it will not attract many birds.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that squirrels are the only reason why a bird feeder may not attract many birds.
  Choice A, B, and D are similar and don't match the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above.
  Choice C's conclusion doesn't follow directly from its premises.
  Choice E's conclusion goes against the premises given in the argument.
  Therefore, none of the arguments are similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement where the antecedent and consequent are reversed. 
  It is stated that if squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. 
  Then it is stated that squirrels will only eat from a bird feeder that lacks a protective cover. 
  Therefore, a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the one in option A where the antecedent and consequent are reversed.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument presented in the context is claiming that bird feeders will not attract many birds if they lack a protective cover.
  The argument is based on the premise that squirrels only eat from bird feeders lacking a protective cover.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is that it relies too heavily on a single assumption, which may not be entirely true.
  Looking at the answer choices:
  A is not similar to the argument in the context.
  B is similar as it has the same structure of relying too heavily on a single assumption.
  C does not fit the pattern of reasoning in the argument in the context.
  D is similar to B in that they share the same structure. However, it is not the same as the argument in the context.
  E is not similar to the argument in the context.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or D. However, B is a better choice because it is more similar to the pattern of reasoning in the argument presented in the context.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument uses a conditional statement and a biconditional statement.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds.
  The argument assumes that the only reason squirrels eat from a bird feeder is because it lacks a protective cover.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in answer choice B because it uses a conditional statement and concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument presents a conditional statement.
  It concludes that if a bird feeder does not have a protective cover, then it will not attract many birds.
  The argument is flawed because it presents a conditional statement and a related conditional statement as if they were logically equivalent.
  Answer choice B presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning by presenting a related conditional statement as if it were logically equivalent.
  Answer choice B concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, but it presents a related conditional statement that tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  Therefore, the answer is B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conditional statement based on a cause-and-effect relationship.
  It infers that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds.
  This is because squirrels will eat from it, which will drive away birds.
  However, the argument did not consider other factors that may affect the bird's attraction to the feeder.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is most similar to that in option E.
  Option E presents a cause-and-effect relationship but overlooked other factors that can affect the outcome.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument uses a conditional statement in which if one thing happens (squirrels eat from bird feeder) then another thing will happen (fewer birds will be attracted) but then assumes that the reverse is also true - if the second thing is true (fewer birds are attracted), then the first thing must have happened (squirrels must have eaten from the feeder).
  Choice A does not have a similar pattern of reasoning as it just states a fact and draws a conclusion from it.
  Choice B has a similar pattern of reasoning with a conditional statement and a reversal of it.
  Choice C does not have a similar pattern of reasoning as it assumes a fact without any evidence.
  Choice D has a similar pattern of reasoning with a conditional statement and a reversal of it.
  Choice E has a different pattern of reasoning as it introduces another condition that can also cause the problem.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or D.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument above presents a flawed pattern of reasoning, where a conditional statement is made in the opposite direction.
  In option A, the argument presents a valid conditional statement but provides an additional statement that does not follow the first two statements.
  Option B repeats the same flawed pattern of reasoning in the opposite direction.
  Option C presents a different argument that does not follow the same flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Option D repeats the same flawed pattern of reasoning in the opposite direction.
  Option E presents a different argument that does not follow the same flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Therefore, none of the options have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as presented in the argument above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that if squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. 
  It assumes that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. 
  It concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The conclusion is based on an assumption that may not be true in all cases.
  Choice C talks about a similar idea of making an assumption.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in choice C.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that watching too much television leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that there is another explanation for why people overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  Choice A is stating that overestimating the dangers is not limited to those who watch too much television, which does not necessarily weaken the argument.
  Choice B contradicts the argument, but it does not weaken the argument.
  Choice C strengthens the argument; if people who watch less TV have a more accurate understanding, it shows that watching TV is responsible for the overestimation.
  Choice D provides an alternative explanation for why some people are well informed, and it weakens the argument.
  Choice E does not weaken the argument, as it is just stating a correlation, and it does not address the cause of overestimating the dangers due to watching too much TV.
  Therefore, the answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The reasoning concludes that people who watch more television are more likely to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  To weaken the conclusion, we need to show that television is not the only or primary factor that leads people to overestimate the risks.
  Choice A is too broad and does not address the role of television.
  Choice B is irrelevant and does not address the role of television.
  Choice C supports the idea that television does play a role in people's perception of risks.
  Choice D provides an alternative explanation for why some people may have accurate perceptions of risks, which weakens the conclusion about television.
  Choice E is irrelevant and does not address the role of television.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that watching too much television is correlated with overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that the conclusion may not be true.
  A, B, and D do not provide any new information that affects the conclusion.
  C suggests that people who watch less TV have a more accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of natural disasters.
  E suggests that living in an area prone to natural disasters may affect the amount of TV people watch.
  If a person who lives in an area prone to natural disasters watches less TV, the conclusion that watching too much TV leads to an overestimation of natural disaster risks cannot be applied to that person.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risk of natural disasters.
  To weaken the argument, we should show that the conclusion is not necessarily true or that there is an alternative explanation.
  Option A talks about people in general, not specifically about people who watch an above-average amount of television, so it is irrelevant.
  Option B is also irrelevant because it talks about people living in areas prone to natural disasters, not about the amount of television they watch.
  Option C supports the argument, so it is not the correct answer.
  Option D provides an alternative explanation for why people might be well-informed about the risks of natural disasters, weakening the argument that television is the cause.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the likelihood of watching television, not about the effect of watching television on risk perception.
  Therefore, Option D is the best answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that people are more likely to overestimate the risks of natural disasters if they watch an above-average amount of television.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this claim.
  Option C states that people who watch a below-average amount of television have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood of being victims of a natural disaster.
  This statement suggests that the amount of television a person watches may not have a significant impact on their perception of the likelihood of natural disasters.
  Therefore, option C weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that watching an above-average amount of television makes people more likely to think they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  To weaken this argument, we must show that television watching is not the cause of this belief or that there is no correlation between the amount of television watched and the likelihood of believing they will be a disaster victim.
  Choice C states that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. 
  This suggests that the amount of television watched is not the cause of the belief, which weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We are looking for an answer that weakens the reasoning above.
  Option A doesn't address the relationship between television and overestimation of natural disaster risks.
  Option B suggests that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas that are prone to natural disasters. It doesn't address if they still overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  Option C suggests that people who watch less television have a fair idea of the likelihood of natural disasters. This weakens the argument because it suggests that television viewing is not the cause of overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  Option D suggests that people who are well informed about natural disasters have gained knowledge in ways other than television viewing. This also weakens the argument because it suggests that television viewing is not the only way to become informed about natural disasters.
  Option E suggests that television viewing and the likelihood of living in an area prone to natural disasters are related. This doesn't necessarily weaken the argument.
  By the process of elimination, option C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that those who watch more television are more likely to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that makes it less likely that television viewing causes overestimation.
  If we can find a statement that shows that overestimation occurs regardless of television viewing, then it would weaken the argument.
  Option (A) does exactly that.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that watching too much television makes people overestimate the risks that the world poses to them and specifically, the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
  To weaken the argument we need to choose an option that contradicts the argument or provides an alternate reason for why people overestimate the risk of natural disasters.
  Option A provides a reason that is not related to television so it does not weaken the argument.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C supports the argument and confirms the premise that people who do not watch as much television tend to have a better idea of the likelihood of natural disasters.
  Option D provides an alternate reason for why people may be well informed about the risk of natural disasters apart from watching television, so it weakens the argument.
  Option E provides an alternate reason for why people who watch more television may be more aware of the risks of natural disasters, but it does not weaken the argument.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that watching an above-average amount of television leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  We need to find the option that challenges this reasoning, that is, an option that shows that watching television does not necessarily lead to overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  Options A, B, D, and E do not challenge the argument.
  Option C presents an alternative reason for why people who watch below-average television might have a more accurate idea of natural disaster risks.
  If people who watch below-average television have access to other sources of information explaining the risks of natural disasters, then the argument's conclusion that television viewing is the cause of overestimating the risks is weakened.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics
Response 0:
Thought:
  The biologist concludes that chameleons and lizards in general bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D based on a small sample study.
  The biologist argues that the study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years to defend the study results.
  The biologist's argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to demonstrate that the sample of six individual chameleons is representative of all lizards.
  Choice A describes this criticism.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument claims that the study's author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years. 
  This claim is not relevant to the conclusion drawn from the study.
  Furthermore, the sample size should be larger to make generalizable conclusions about all lizards.
  Therefore, the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  The answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument states that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  The argument also defends the study against critics.
  However, the argument does not explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because of its reasoning.
  The argument presents a conclusion based only on one sample of chameleons.
  The argument does not provide any evidence that chameleons are representative of lizards as a whole.
  The argument defends the study's conclusion by referring to the study's author's reputation and past work instead of the study itself.
  The argument fails to address the actual objections or criticisms of the study.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
  The answer is A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results because the author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it focuses on the author's reputation instead of the study's methods and findings.
  Therefore, the answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that the study's results were not in doubt because the study's author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  However, this reasoning does not address the concern that the sample size of the study was very small.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism for not addressing the issue of the small sample size.
  The answer is not C, D or E as they are not related to the main argument. 
  The argument is not making a generalization that chameleons represent all lizards, so A is not correct.
  The argument does not fail to explain the mechanism of how chameleons regulate vitamin D, so B is not correct.

Thought: 
  The biologist's argument states that despite the small sample size, the critics are wrong to doubt the results because the author is a professional and has been doing excellent work for years.
  The argument is based on the author's reputation and expertise rather than the study's methodology and results.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  The answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that the study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years. However, this does not necessarily mean that the biologist's study is well-designed or that the results are valid. Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  The answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument in the passage is that the study's results should not be doubted due to the author's credentials and reputation.
  However, this is not a strong argument in support of the study's results.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument relies too heavily on the author's reputation and does not address the criticism of the study's small sample size.
  The answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The biologist claims that the study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This statement doesn't explain how the small study's conclusion is valid and cannot be doubted.
  The author cites a conclusion based on a small sample size, which raises generalization concerns.
  The answer should reflect this vulnerability.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument states that the increase in subscription rates indicates that publishing scholarly journals must be more profitable.
We need to find an option that provides an alternate explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
Option A talks about libraries passing on the costs to their users, but it does not explain the increase in subscription rates. 
Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
Option C supports the argument. 
Option D provides an alternate explanation for the increase in subscription rates, and hence weakens the argument.
Option E is not relevant to the argument.
Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The argument states that the cost of publishing a scholarly journal has remained constant, but the subscription rate has increased. 
Option A does not dispute the conclusion in the argument. 
Option B is irrelevant to the argument. 
Option C supports the conclusion in the argument. 
Option D weakens the argument, suggesting that the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged. 
Option E does not dispute the conclusion in the argument.
Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant, yet the subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, indicating that publishing a scholarly journal is much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken the argument, we need to provide evidence that contradicts this claim.
  Option A suggests that increased journal subscription costs are being passed on to library users, suggesting that publishers are not making more profit than they did several years ago.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument, as it doesn't provide any evidence that contradicts the claim.
  Option C reinforces the argument, stating that publishers cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  Option D also does not provide any evidence that contradicts the argument.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is based on the premise that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant, and that subscription rates have increased dramatically in the last several years, thus implying that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now.
  To weaken this argument, we need to provide an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
  Option D presents an alternative explanation stating most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. This means that the increase in subscription rates is not due to higher profitability but due to a change in the pricing strategy for libraries.
  Therefore, option D most seriously weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
The argument states that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant, yet the average subscription rate has increased dramatically. Then, it concludes that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the conclusion. 
Option A talks about charging higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users. It is irrelevant to the argument. 
Option B explains the acquisition budget represents only a small fraction of the total operating budget. It doesn't contradict anything in the argument. 
Option C supports the argument.
Option D is the right answer because it contradicts the conclusion by stating that subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
The argument states that the subscription rates have increased dramatically over the last several years, yet the cost of publishing has remained constant. Thus, the publishers must be making much more profit from scholarly journals than they were before. The correct answer choice would weaken the argument.
Option A provides an idea that university libraries are passing on the increased journal subscription costs to library users, which can imply that the increase in subscription rates is not going straight through to the publisher's profits. Therefore, option A can weaken the argument.
Option B talks about the acquisition budget of a university library being a small fraction of its total operating budget. However, this does not weaken the argument; instead, it provides irrelevant information.
Option C actually strengthens the argument by saying that publishers cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
Option D talks about subscribers, not publishers; hence, it does not provide any information on the publisher's profitability.
Option E is also irrelevant to the argument; the number of times the journal is published does not provide any information on the publisher's profits.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument assumes that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained constant.
  One answer choice that could weaken the argument is one that suggests that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have increased.
  If the costs of publishing have increased, then the increase in subscription rates could be necessary to keep the publishers in business.
  Choice C suggests that publishing a scholarly journal is expensive, and publishers cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  This answer choice weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for why subscription rates have increased.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
The argument is that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant but the subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically. The conclusion is that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now. To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that contradicts this conclusion.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is also irrelevant to the argument.
Option C strengthens the argument.
Option D is the correct answer because if the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years, it suggests that publishing a scholarly journal is not more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is that the subscription rates for scholarly journals have increased and publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the argument.
  (A) does not address the argument.
  (B) is not relevant to the argument.
  (C) supports the argument.
  (D) contradicts the argument by stating that the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  (E) is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the costs of publishing have not increased dramatically while the subscription rates have.
  If publishing costs have increased similarly, then publishers' profits may not have increased.
  Option C weakens the argument by suggesting that publishers need to make profits to stay afloat.
  This implies that publishers may be increasing subscription rates to compensate for increased publishing costs, not to increase profits.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychologist: Doctors should never prescribe sedatives for people with insomnia. Most cases of insomnia that psychologists treat are known to be caused by psychological stress. This suggests that insomniacs do not need drugs that alter their biochemistry, but rather need psychotherapy to help them alleviate the stress causing their insomnia.
Question: Each of the following describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: It presumes, without providing warrant, that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress.
  B: It fails to consider the possibility that sedatives are the only treatment known to be effective for cases of insomnia not caused by stress.
  C: It neglects the possibility that for some people psychotherapy is a completely ineffective treatment for stress.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress.
  E: It presumes, without providing justification, that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The psychologist suggests that sedatives should not be prescribed for people with insomnia.
  The author's reasoning is that most cases of insomnia that psychologists treat are caused by psychological stress and therefore do not need sedatives.
  A: The author's reasoning does not presume that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress.
  B: The author's reasoning fails to consider the possibility that sedatives are the only treatment known to be effective for cases of insomnia not caused by stress.
  C: The author's reasoning neglects the possibility that for some people psychotherapy is a completely ineffective treatment for stress.
  D: The author's reasoning overlooks the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress.

  The answer is C: It neglects the possibility that for some people psychotherapy is a completely ineffective treatment for stress. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
The question asks us to identify the answer that does not describe a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
A: Discusses the psychologist's presumption about the relationship between insomnia and stress. This is a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
B: Discusses the failure to consider the possibility of sedatives being the only effective treatment for insomnia not caused by stress. This is a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
C: Discusses the neglect of the possibility that psychotherapy is not an effective treatment for some people. This is a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
D: Discusses the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress. This is not a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
E: Discusses the psychologist's presumption that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia. This is a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
Therefore, the answer is D: It overlooks the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The psychologist argues that sedatives should not be prescribed for insomnia but rather psychotherapy should be used to alleviate stress.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it doesn't challenge any of the psychologist's reasoning.
  Choice B is a potential flaw because the argument doesn't consider the possibility of sedatives being the most effective treatment for some cases of insomnia not caused by stress.
  Choice C is a potential flaw because the psychologist doesn't consider the possibility that psychotherapy might be ineffective for some people to treat stress.
  Choice D is a potential flaw because it overlooks the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress.
  Choice E is a potential flaw because the psychologist presumes that the cases psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia.
  The question is asking for the option that does NOT describe a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
  The only option that does not describe a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning is A.
  Therefore, the answer is A: It presumes, without providing warrant, that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
- The psychologist suggests that people with insomnia caused by psychological stress should not take sedatives and instead seek psychotherapy.
- Flaw A is incorrect because the psychologist doesn't make any such presumption.
- Flaw B seems reasonable, as the psychologist does not consider the possibility that sedatives are the only effective treatment for insomnia not caused by stress.
- Flaw C might be true, but it is not necessarily a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
- Flaw D is the opposite of what the psychologist is arguing.
- Flaw E provides a possible flaw in the psychologist's reasoning because the psychologist assumes that the cases are representative of all insomniacs.
- Therefore, the correct answer is E: It presumes, without providing justification, that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
The psychologist argues that doctors should not prescribe sedatives for people with insomnia, instead they need psychotherapy to alleviate stress causing insomnia. According to the argument, sedatives are not the appropriate treatment for insomnia, but psychotherapy is. 
  A: It discusses insomnia contributing to an inability to cope with stress, which is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: It suggests that sedatives are the only treatment effective for insomnia not caused by stress, which is opposite of the psychologist's argument.
  C: It talks about psychotherapy for stress being ineffective for some people, but it doesn't show a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
  D: It suggests that sedatives could be helpful for insomniacs to deal with stress, which is actually in line with the psychologist's argument.
  E: It discusses cases treated by psychologists may not represent all cases of insomnia, which is related to the argument's generalization.
  
  Therefore, the answer is B: It fails to consider the possibility that sedatives are the only treatment known to be effective for cases of insomnia not caused by stress. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that doctors should never prescribe sedatives for people with insomnia, and instead, they need psychotherapy to alleviate stress.
  A states an irrelevant point since the argument is not about insomnia's ability to cope with stress.
  B is a valid point, and it does not describe a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning. Thus, it is the answer.
  C is a valid point, but it does not describe a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
  D is a valid point, but it does not describe a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
  E is a valid point, but it does not describe a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument made by the psychologist is that doctors should never prescribe sedatives to people with insomnia because most cases of insomnia that psychologists treat are caused by psychological stress.
  Option A is not a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning because it is not specifically mentioned in the argument that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress.
  Option B is a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning because it fails to consider the possibility that sedatives may be the only effective treatment for some cases of insomnia.
  Option C is a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning because it ignores the possibility that psychotherapy may not be effective for some people in treating their stress.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors has resulted in the reduction of patient injuries.
We need to find a statement that shows the causal link between the implementation of the plan and the reduction of patient injuries.
The correct answer should establish that the reduction in patient injuries was caused by the implementation of the plan.
A, C, and E are not relevant to the argument.
B suggests that the decrease in patient injuries at the participating hospitals might have been a general trend in the region. Therefore, it weakens rather than strengthens the argument.
D is the best answer because it suggests that the awareness of the staff that their errors were being monitored led to a reduction in patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries substantially. If an option that reinforces the relationship between recording staff errors and reducing patient injuries can be found, it will strengthen the argument.
A weakener would be a piece of information that contradicts the idea that recording staff errors is responsible for the reduction in the incidence of patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D") 
Choice D states that the decrease in the incidence of injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. This implies that the staffs became more cautious after they realized the records were being closely monitored, which reinforces the argument that knowledge of monitoring made the hospitals' staff more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties. Therefore, D strengthens the argument the most.
Response 2:
Thought:
The argument states that the incidence of injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan to record all staff errors. 
This suggests that the staff became more careful knowing that their errors were being monitored.
To strengthen the argument, we need to find a choice that supports this explanation.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B does not relate to the hospitals that implemented the plan.
Option C weakens the argument by suggesting that some errors were left unrecorded.
Option D supports the argument by suggesting that the knowledge of monitoring led to the decrease in injuries.
Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that the implementation of the plan to systematically record all staff errors reduced the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
  We need to find the answer that strengthens this claim.
  A, C, and E are irrelevant to the argument. They do not add to or take away from the argument.
  B does not strengthen the argument. The argument is about hospitals that implemented the plan. This answer is about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  D strengthens the argument. It provides a plausible reason for why recording errors led to a decrease in injuries. It suggests that the knowledge of being closely analyzed led to a change in behavior.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the decrease in patient injury incidents can be attributed to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find a statement that supports the causal relationship between the plan implementation and the decrease in patient injury incidents.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument, as the policy existed before the plan was implemented.
  Choice B is interesting, but it is not clear whether the hospital that did not participate in the plan had any other measures in place to reduce patient injuries.
  Choice C weakens the argument, as the plan should have recorded all staff errors, not just the ones that caused patient injuries.
  Choice D is the best answer, as it shows that the decrease in patient injury incidents did not start until the staff became aware of the close analysis of the records. This provides evidence of the causal relationship between the plan implementation and the decrease in patient injury incidents.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument, as it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the implementation of the plan to record all staff errors resulted in decreasing the incidence of patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need a statement that shows that the reduction in patient injuries is linked with the implementation of the plan.
  Option B is not relevant as it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument by stating that only some types of errors were recorded and not all of them.
  Option E is also irrelevant as it talks about the consequences of the errors.
  Options A and D both talk about the effect of the implementation of the plan on the staff.
  Option A states that the hospitals used to investigate errors before implementing the plan, which means the staff already knew their errors were being monitored. Therefore, it doesn't explain why the implementation of the plan led to a reduction in patient injuries.
  Option D supports the argument by stating that the decrease in injuries only began when the staff became aware that their errors were being closely analyzed, which is the result of implementing the plan.
  The answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
The argument is that the systematic recording of staff errors decreased patient injuries by making staff more meticulous in their duties.
To strengthen the argument, the choice should support that the decrease is due to the systematic recording of the errors.
Choice A is not relevant to the plan, it focuses on a different policy before the plan was implemented.
Choice B is weak, it is unrelated to the plan implemented at the hospitals.
Choice C is irrelevant, it suggests that there could be more errors not recorded, but it does not support the argument.
Choice D strengthens the argument by stating that the decrease in injuries began after the staff became aware of the monitoring. 
Choice E is unrelated to the plan’s implementation.
Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.

Response 7:
Thought:
The argument claims that the systematic recording of staff errors reduces the incidence of patient injuries.
To strengthen the argument, we need to find the answer choice that supports the idea that the knowledge of the staff that their errors are being recorded really increased their carefulness.
Option A does not strengthen the argument, it talks about a policy that was in place before the implementation of the plan.
Option B provides an alternative explanation for the decrease in patient injuries, which weakens the argument.
Option C weakens the argument as it suggests that the plan overlooked some errors.
Option D strengthens the argument by stating that the decrease in injuries began only after the staff became aware of the records.
Option E is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about the consequences of the errors, not the impact of recording them.
Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that directly connects the decrease in patient injuries to the implementation of the plan.

  Option B talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan and is irrelevant.
  Option C states that not all errors were recorded, which is irrelevant.
  Option D supports the argument by stating that awareness of the monitoring caused the decrease.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded
  E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
Response 0:
Thought:
  The CEO claims that their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods.
  The CEO claims that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
  The CEO argues that their corporation is environmentally responsible since they are doing all they can to pollute less.
  The argument is flawed since it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed.
  Therefore, the answer is A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The CEO mentions that the company's current production methods pollute less than their old ones.
  The CEO argues that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
  The CEO concludes that the company is environmentally responsible because it does all it can to pollute less.
  The CEO's reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that the company is doing all it can to pollute less and that there are no other methods of production that can be developed to pollute less.
  The flaw in the argument is that the CEO does not consider the possibility that there may be other production methods that would allow the company to pollute less than they are currently doing.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The CEO's argument is that the company has reduced pollution significantly, but there are no methods to produce without pollution.
  The CEO is assuming that there are no methods to produce without pollution and takes it for granted.
  The CEO's argument is also assuming that the current method is the best method available.
  The argument does not address the possibility of exploring new ways to reduce pollution.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed.
  The answer is A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed.
Action: Answer("A")

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission claims that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats, and thus development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. This means that the Commission's argument depends on the assumption that replacement wetland habitats will be able to effectively compensate for the loss of natural wetlands. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that development of wetlands in Figoria should be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The conclusion depends on an assumption.
  It should be something that is necessary to establish the conclusion.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it says nothing about the conclusion.
  Choice C is also not relevant because the argument is not about nations that are primarily agricultural.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because the argument is concerned with the future and not the past.
  Choice E is also not relevant. If the species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species, then there is even more reason to protect them.
  Therefore, the assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends is that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will not survive without specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  The answer is B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission is arguing that wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetlands to protect the wildlife living in wetlands.
Therefore, the argument depends on the assumption that the construction of replacement wetlands will be sufficient to protect the wildlife living in wetlands.
Choice (B) states exactly that, so it is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission seeks to regulate wetland development in Figoria by offsetting with the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  If the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats cannot survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, then the regulation would not achieve its intended purpose of protecting wildlife.
  Therefore, the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Figorian Wildlife Commission argues for the regulation of wetland development and that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth and development.
  The assumption which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on should be a premise which if false, undermines the conclusion of the Wildlife Commission and supports the Development Commission's argument.
  The replacement wetland habitats will not be effective if the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats do not survive in them.
  Therefore, the assumption that the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on is B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that development of wetlands should be offset by building replacement habitats to conserve wildlife. 
To support this argument, the Commission must assume that building replacement wetlands would actually protect and preserve the wildlife species that are threatened by development.
Choice B makes this assumption by stating that "the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands."
Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is that to protect wildlife, they must regulate the development of wetlands in Figoria, and future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
An assumption is a statement that the author takes for granted.
The assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends is that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands. If this assumption is not valid, then the entire argument collapses.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats in order to protect wildlife.
  An assumption is a premise of an argument that is not stated explicitly but is necessary to reach the argument's conclusion.
  Therefore, an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends is stating that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  The answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is that to protect wildlife, any wetland development must be offset by constructing replacement wetlands. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them.
If the species that inhabit natural wetlands can't survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, then the plan of the Figorian Wildlife Commission will not work. Therefore, this assumption is critical to the argument made by the Commission.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. 
Developing wetlands has endangered many species. 
To protect wildlife we must regulate wetland development in Figoria.
Allowing development would cause no net reduction of wetlands as it would be replaced by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
Therefore, the argument depends on the assumption that replacement wetland habitats will be effective in supporting the species that inhabit natural wetland habitats.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In order to relieve traffic congestion, the city of Gastner built a new highway linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area. However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps, to explain the increase in average commute time?
Choices:
  A: Most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs.
  B: The location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs.
  C: Shortly after the new highway was opened, several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights.
  D: At the same time the new highway was being built,. road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner.
  E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The city of Gastner built a new highway linking several suburbs to the downtown area.
  After the new highway was opened, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased.
  We need to find an option that could possibly explain the reason behind the increase in the average commute time.
  Option A and B does not provide any explanation for the increase in the average commute time.
  Option C talks about suburban roads, not the new highway.
  Option D might be a strong contender, but we need to know where the road repair work was being done to be sure.
  Option E states that there was an increase in traffic near the new highway after it was opened, which could have contributed to the increase in the average commute time.
  Thus, the answer is E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway became more congested after the new highway was opened. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The new highway was built to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  In order to explain why this happened, we need to look for an option that makes the relationship between the new highway and increased commute time unclear or ambiguous.
  Option A doesn't explain why the commute time increased.
  Option B doesn't provide any information about why the commute time increased.
  Option C doesn't provide a conclusive explanation for why the commute time increased.
  Option D also doesn't provide a conclusive explanation for why the commute time increased.
  Option E suggests that traffic in the downtown area became more congested after the new highway was opened, which could explain why the average commute time increased.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The city built a new highway to relieve traffic congestion.
  The average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  We need to find the most plausible explanation for the increase in average commute time.
  If we assume that the workers in the city's suburbs who commute to downtown Gastner use the new highway, then we can eliminate A as a possible explanation.
  Choice B provides a possible explanation as the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs.
  Choice C is not a plausible explanation for the increase in average commute time.
  Choice D is unlikely to contribute to the increase in average commute time as the road repair work was being done in downtown Gastner and the new highway links the suburbs to the downtown area.
  Choice E provides a possible explanation as traffic on the roads near the new highway in downtown Gastner became more congested.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The new highway was built to relieve traffic congestion.
  The average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  Therefore, something must have happened that negated the positive effect of the new highway.
  Choice A does not explain why the commute time increased.
  Choice B may explain why people are using the new highway more, but not why the average commute time increased.
  Choice C may actually divert commuters to other roads, and thus, may have helped improve the average commute time.
  Choice D talks about road repair work being done at the same time as the new highway was being built, but it doesn't explain why the commute time increased.
  Choice E suggests that traffic near the new highway became more congested. This may explain why the average commute time increased.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The new highway was built to ease traffic congestion.
  However, average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  To explain this increase in average commute time, we need to identify a factor that could have contributed to this.
  If most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs, it could be that with the opening of the new highway, more people started using it, leading to congestion and increased commute time for downtown workers.
  Therefore, A seems to be the most plausible answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The city of Gastner built a new highway to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  The question asks for an explanation for this increase in commute time.
  Answer choice A states that most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs. So, if the downtown area’s workers generally commute from the suburbs, the new highway might have caused an increase in traffic coming from the suburbs. This increase in traffic could be the reason for the increase in commute time.
  It is possible that answer choice B could also be correct. However, it is not as relevant as answer choice A.
  Answer choice C mentions that suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights. However, this answer choice provides an alternative reason for why traffic in downtown Gastner might be slower, not a reason for the increase in commute time.
  Answer choice D mentions road repair work being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner at the same time the new highway was being built. This might also cause delays in commute time. However, it is not as relevant as answer choice A.
  Answer choice E mentions that traffic on the roads near the new highway became more congested after the new highway was opened. However, it only mentions the roads near the highway, not necessarily in downtown Gastner where the increase in commute time was observed.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: Most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The new highway linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area was built to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  The question asks for the explanation for the increase in average commute time.
  Option A, B, C, and D do not explain why the average commute time increased.
  Option E explains that even though the new highway was built to relieve traffic congestion, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.
  This could be the reason why the average commute time increased.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The city of Gastner built a new highway to relieve traffic congestion connecting several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  To explain the increase in average commute time, a statement that shows a possible reason for the increase is required.
  Option C talks about the upgrading of suburban roads that connect to the new highway, but it is not clear how this would affect the commute time of workers in downtown Gastner.
  Option D talks about repair work on important streets leading to downtown Gastner while the new highway was being built, but this does not explain the increase in average commute time after the new highway opened.
  Option E only talks about the increase in traffic congestion in the roads near the new highway after it was opened, but this does not explain why the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased.
  Options A and B are both plausible explanations as they both suggest reasons why the new highway may have resulted in increased average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner.
  However, option A is the most likely answer because it directly states that most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs, which means that the new highway could have resulted in more traffic from the suburbs to downtown, thereby increasing the average commute time.
  The answer is A: Most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The new highway was built to relieve traffic congestion, but the average commute time increased after opening the new highway.
  We need to find an explanation for the increase in average commute time.
  Option A is already mentioned in the context, so it does not explain the increase in commute time.
  Option B is a possible explanation as the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs.
  Option C does not explain the increase in commute time as new stoplights should have improved the traffic flow.
  Option D may have had an effect on the traffic flow but does not explain the increase in commute time.
  Option E is a possible explanation as traffic on roads near the new highway became more congested after the new highway was opened.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The city built a new highway linking several suburbs to the downtown area to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  To explain this, we need to find a reason why the new highway did not relieve traffic congestion or even made it worse.
  Option A suggests that most people who work in downtown Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs. This information, however, does not help explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option B suggests that the location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs. This could be a possible explanation for the increase in average commute time. If most people are using the new highway to travel from suburbs, increased traffic could lead to longer average commute times for everyone.
  Option C suggests that several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights. This information, however, does not help explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option D suggests that road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner at the same time as the new highway was being built. This could be a possible explanation for the increase in average commute time. If important roads leading to downtown were closed or under construction, this could have added to the traffic congestion.
  Option E suggests that traffic on roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened. This could also be a possible explanation for the increase in average commute time. If the new highway caused increased traffic on nearby roads, this would add to the congestion and make average commute times longer.
  Based on the above analysis, options B, D, and E could be possible explanations for the increase in average commute time. However, option B is the most direct explanation, as it suggests that increased traffic on the new highway caused the increase in average commute time.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is discussing a situation where the evidence suggests that a local auto repair shop is responsible for the pollution in the river. However, the penalty for this type of pollution is severe, so the identity of the polluter must be certain before the penalty can be imposed. 
  Choice A directly addresses the relationship between the severity of the penalty and the strength of evidence required to impose the penalty, and this principle aligns with the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot impose the penalty.
  Principle A states that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  Principle A supports the reasoning in the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also states that without stronger evidence or a confession, the identity of the polluter cannot be certain enough to impose the penalty.
  The reasoning in the argument is that the severity of the penalty requires a higher level of certainty of guilt.
  The principle that best justifies this reasoning is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that the severity of the penalty for the infraction is too high to be imposed on the auto-repair shop.
  The assumption is that without stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  Therefore, the principle that would justify the reasoning in the argument is the one stating that the severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the certainty of guilt.
  Choice A comes close to describing this principle, but it is not accurate enough to be selected.
  Choice E best describes the principle and justifies the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument discusses the severity of the penalty for the pollution infraction.
  The argument notes that there is not enough evidence to identify the polluter with certainty.
  The argument suggests that a severe penalty cannot be imposed unless there is stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility.
  Principle (A) best justifies the reasoning in the argument as it directly discusses the relationship between penalty severity and the need for certainty of guilt.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
The argument talks about how the severity of the penalty affects the decision to impose the penalty.
If the penalty for an infraction is severe, then one must be certain of the guilt of the party before imposing the penalty.
This is in line with option A.
Option B, C, D, and E do not directly address the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument is about whether to impose a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river.
  The severity of the penalty is so high that stronger evidence or admission of guilt is needed to justify imposing it.
  The reasoning is based on certainty of guilt before imposing a penalty.
  Choice A most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument is about the justification for imposing a penalty on a party responsible for polluting a river.
  The reasoning is that the penalty is severe, and unless stronger evidence is found or the perpetrator admits responsibility, it is not justified to impose the penalty.
  Choice A is consistent with this reasoning since it states that the more severe the penalty is, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing the penalty.
  Choices B and C do not provide any justification for the reasoning in the argument.
  Choice D is opposite to the reasoning in the argument because it implies that the severity of the penalty will deter someone from admitting responsibility, and therefore, it is not a good justification for the reasoning.
  Choice E is a restatement of the reasoning in the argument.
  Therefore, choice A is the most helpful principle for justifying the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument is about whether to impose a penalty on a local auto repair shop for polluting a river. 
  The argument suggests that the penalty is severe, and requires stronger evidence or admission of responsibility before imposing it.
  Answer A talks about the relationship between the severity of the penalty and certainty of guilt, which is relevant to the argument. 
  Answer B mentions the importance of deterrent, but is not directly related to the argument. 
  Answer C talks about the proportionality of the penalty to the harm caused, but is not directly related to the argument. 
  Answer D discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility, but is not directly related to the argument. 
  Answer E is similar to answer A and talks about the relationship between the severity of the penalty and certainty of guilt.
  Answer A and E are both relevant, but answer A is a more precise restatement of the reasoning in the argument. 
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument is about the justification of imposing a severe penalty.
  The speaker argues that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to impose the penalty.
  The principle that most helps to justify this reasoning is that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the certainty of guilt.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The columnist's argument is that the extra money from water bills should not be used to build new roads.
  The legislator's proposal is to use the money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist argues that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The principle that could most help justify the columnist's judgment is that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  The legislator's proposal to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads only benefits some members of the community.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
- The columnist thinks that using the money collected from the additional charge on water bills to build new roads is unacceptable.
- The justification for this conclusion is not explicitly stated in the text.
- Option A is not relevant because the argument is not about the right of customers to know how their money is being used.
- Option B is relevant because it argues that money should not be used for a project that benefits only some members of a community, which supports the idea that the money collected from the water bill should be used to fund the dam, which is a project benefiting the entire community.
- Option C is not relevant because the text does not mention that most of the utility's customers disapprove of the project.
- Option D is not relevant because the text does not mention that the legislature did not approve the additional charge.
- Option E is not relevant because the text does not mention that the use of the additional charge is not related to water-related expenditures.
- Therefore, B is the most relevant option that supports the conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The columnist thinks that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The legislator's proposal is to use extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist thinks that the extra money should be used to build a dam, and not to build new roads.
  To justify the columnist's judgment, we need to find a principle that supports building a dam over building new roads.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B does not provide any guidance on whether a dam or a road should be built.
  Option C is also irrelevant because it talks about community approval, not whether a dam or a road should be built.
  Option D is incorrect because the approval of the legislature is already given for collecting an additional charge, and the question is not about imposing additional charges.
  Option E is the most relevant principle because it argues that an additional charge should be used only for water-related expenditures, which supports building a dam.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal to use the extra money to build new roads is unacceptable.
  In order to justify the columnist's judgment, we need to find a principle that supports the idea that the money should be used for building a dam.
  Choice B states that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community. This supports the idea that the money collected from water bills should be used for a project that benefits the entire community, such as a dam.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use the revenue to build a dam.
  A member of the legislature has proposed spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.
  The columnist thinks the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The most relevant principle to justify the columnist's judgment is that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  The construction of a dam would benefit the entire community, while the construction of new roads would not.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The columnist disagrees with the legislator's proposal to use extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  To justify this disagreement, a principle needs to be identified which can explain why the proposal is unacceptable.
  Option B is the most relevant principle in this context. 
  It states that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  The proposal of building roads may not benefit the entire community while building a dam would provide water benefits to the entire community.
  Therefore, the principle in option B supports the columnist's argument against the legislator's proposal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The columnist thinks that using money from water bills designated for building a dam to build new roads is unacceptable.
  The legislator's proposal is to use that extra money from water bills to build new roads.
  The columnist's judgment is concerned with the use of the money from water bills.
  Option B states that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community. 
  The columnists' concern is that the extra money from water bills should be used for building a dam, a project that benefits the entire community, instead of building new roads that only benefit some members of the community.
  Therefore, B is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The columnist believes that building new roads with the extra money collected from water bills is not justifiable.
  The legislator's proposal is to spend the extra money from water bills on building new roads instead of a dam.
  The question asks which principle can justify the columnist's judgment of the proposal being 'unacceptable.'
  Option B best helps justify the columnist's judgment that the proposal is unacceptable.
  If the money collected from the water bills is designated for projects that benefit the entire community, it should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of the community, such as building new roads.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The columnist argues that it's unacceptable to spend the extra money collected from water bills on other purposes like building roads.
The logic behind the proposal of the legislator is not clear.
The correct answer should justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
Option E justifies the columnist's judgment that the additional charge collected from water bills is only for water-related expenses, not for other purposes like building new roads.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The columnist thinks the legislator's proposal to use extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam is unacceptable.
  The proposal to use money collected by a water utility to construct new roads is not related to the purpose of the water utility.
  So, the principle that a utility cannot use its revenue for unrelated purposes might support the columnist's judgment.
  Thus, the answer is E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.

Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The population of Florida panthers is currently between 70-100.
  The current habitat of Florida panthers cannot support any more of these animals.
  The population of Florida panthers must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  Therefore, unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The Florida panther population must reach 250 to be self-sustaining.
  The current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers.
  Therefore, there is a need for a larger habitat to support a self-sustaining population.
  Therefore, the statement that must be true is C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The Florida panther population has increased, but it is still not large enough to be self-sustaining.
  The current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.

  The answer is C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage states that the Florida panthers are currently living in a habitat that is too small to support any more of these animals and that their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  Therefore, unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  The other statements are not necessarily true based on the information given in the passage.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: The most important function of epic poetry is to transmit the values by which a group of people is to live. This transmission is accomplished not by an explicit discussion of those values, but rather by their embodiment in heroic figures, who are presented as role models. Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
Question: If the professor's statements are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: An important function of poetry is to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it.
  B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  C: When values are represented in poetry, they are rarely if ever set forth explicitly.
  D: For many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
  E: Only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models that, if imitated, give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear it.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The professor is discussing the function of epic poetry.
  The most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by which a group of people is to live.
  This transmission is accomplished by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  The embodiment of values in heroic figures gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  The correct answer must be a statement that is implied by the professor's argument.
  Option A may be true, but it is not necessarily implied by the argument.
  Option B is true and is stated explicitly in the argument.
  Option C is true based on the argument since it is stated that the values are not explicitly discussed.
  Option D is also true based on the argument, since the heroic figures represent the values by which the people are to live.
  Option E is not true since the professor does not state that only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The professor argues that epic poetry's most important function is to transmit values through heroic figures presented as role models.
  From this, we can infer that epic poetry accomplishes this function through presenting heroic figures as role models.
  The professor also notes that values are not explicitly discussed but rather embodied in heroic figures.
  This implies that the values are represented in poetry, just not through explicit discussion.
  The professor's argument is broader than just epic poetry; it is talking about poetry more generally.
  Therefore, it is likely that other forms of poetry also have an important function to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it.
  Choice A expresses this idea.
  Choice B is a restatement of the professor's argument and is therefore true.
  Choice C is a partial restatement of the professor's argument and is therefore true, but it is less clear than B.
  Choice D is a restatement of the professor's argument and is therefore true.
  Choice E is too extreme; the professor's argument does not say that epic poetry is the only form of poetry that can accomplish this function.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The professor's statements claim that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by embodying them in heroic figures.
  The professor also claims that imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  Choice (B) directly echoes the professor's statements, indicating that the most important function of epic poetry is to present heroic figures as role models.
  Therefore, (B) must be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The professor states that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  The professor mentions that those who hear the poems can derive meaning and direction by imitating these role models.
  Therefore, the correct answer must reflect these statements.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The professor argues that epic poetry transmits values through the embodiment of heroic figures as role models.
  If the statement is true, then one of the necessary implications is that epic poems accomplish this function through the embodiment of heroic figures.
  Answer B states this implication clearly.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The professor argues that epic poetry transmits values through heroic figures who serve as role models, giving meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  Therefore, if the professor's statements are true, then the answer choice that must be true is one that aligns with this argument.
  Choice A is too broad and not specifically related to the argument.
  Choice C is too extreme and uses the word 'rarely if ever' which is not supported by the context.
  Choice E is too extreme and uses the word 'Only', which is not supported by the context.
  Hence, the answer choice that aligns with the professor's argument and must be true is B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The professor asserts that epic poetry transmits values through heroic figures who are presented as role models.
  The professor does not say that other forms of poetry do not have the same function.
  Therefore, statement A and E are incorrect.
  The professor's assertion supports statement B because epic poetry accomplishes its most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  The professor suggests that values are embodied in heroic figures, not that they are rarely set forth explicitly. Therefore, statement C is incorrect.
  The professor's assertion suggest that for at least some groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live. Therefore, statement D is supported by the professor's assertion.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The professor's statements identify the primary function of epic poetry.
  The identified function involves the transmission of values through the embodiment of those values in heroic figures that serve as role models.
  Choice A is not mentioned in the statements.
  Choice B accurately represents the professor's contention.
  Choice C is supported by the professor's statements.
  Choice D accurately summarizes the professor's argument.
  Choice E is incorrect due to its use of the word "only" - the professor's statements do not suggest that epic poetry is the only genre that presents heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The professor claims that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit the values by which a group of people is to live implicitly through the embodiment of heroic figures as role models.
  Therefore, the correct answer must reflect the implicit transmission of values through heroic figures as role models.
  Answer A is too general. Although poetry can give meaning and direction to lives, the professor's discussion is about the specific function of epic poetry.
  Answer B is consistent with the professor's claims about the function of epic poetry in transmitting values implicitly through heroic figures as role models.
  Answer C is a partial truth, but the professor's claim is that values are embodied in heroic figures, not that they are rarely explicitly set forth.
  Answer D accurately summarizes the professor's claim that heroic figures embody values by which people are to live.
  Answer E is incorrect because the professor does not claim that only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models that give meaning to the lives of those who hear it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The professor argues that epic poetry transmits values by presenting heroic figures that embody those values and serve as role models.
  The question asks which statement must also be true based on the professor's argument.
  Statement B correctly restates the professor's argument by stating that epic poetry accomplishes its most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument supports this by citing a survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  The argument assumes that the sample surveyed is a fair representation of the population.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if the sample surveyed is not a fair representation of the population.
  Choice A questions the validity of the sample by suggesting that some of the surveyed policyholders saved little or no money when they switched to Popelka.
  This would mean that the surveyed sample is not a fair representation of the population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument in the advertisement is that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is based on the survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders who reported savings of $250 a year, on average.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism that the survey may not be representative.
  Choice A states that it overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  This is a valid criticism because the survey may be biased towards people who saved money after switching their auto insurance policy to Popelka, leading to an overestimate of expected savings.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that the new policyholders save $250 a year, on average, by switching to Popelka Auto Insurance.
  It concludes that most people who hold insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on one of the following grounds.
  Option A is a possible vulnerability, as the argument only considers those who reported savings.
  Option B is not a vulnerability, as the argument is not concerned with comparing the new policyholders to longer-standing ones.
  Option C is a possible vulnerability, as the argument only considers the savings from switching to Popelka, and not other insurance companies.
  Option D is not a vulnerability, as it does not matter if the policyholders underestimated their savings when they switched.
  Option E is a possible vulnerability, as it assumes that those capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka are not overrepresented among the new policyholders.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka based on the survey results of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  The argument assumes that the sample is representative of all people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies.
  The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  Therefore, the answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that most people who have auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The advertisement uses a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders to support the claim.
  The argument is vulnerable on the ground that the sample might not be representative of all policyholders.
  Answer C is incorrect because the advertisement claims that "most" people who have auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka, not all.
  Answer D is incorrect because the advertisement does not make any assumption about the underestimation of savings.
  Answer E is incorrect because it is not relevant to the argument presented.
  Answer B is incorrect because the advertisement does not make any assumption about the payment of auto insurance policyholders.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
 The argument in the advertisement assumes that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  It supports this argument by citing a survey that reports an average savings of $250 a year for a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it overlooks some possibilities or takes for granted some points that might affect the validity of the argument.
  Choice A points out that the survey might not be representative of all the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders, and some of them might have saved little or no money by switching to Popelka.
  Therefore, choice A is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument in the advertisement states that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  However, the argument may be vulnerable to criticism if there are possibilities that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched, or if switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
  Therefore, the answer is E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  It is possible that some new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  It is not clear whether the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  The advertisement fails to address the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  The advertisement takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  The advertisement fails to address the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
  Choice A and E are both possible criticisms.
  However, choice A is a more direct criticism, as differences in people's circumstances could mean that some people do not save money, despite switching to Popelka.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument in the advertisement is that people could save hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  However, the argument may be criticized on certain grounds.
  Choice A is incorrect because the argument assumes that most policyholders save a certain amount of money.
  Choice B is incorrect because it doesn't take for granted anything about how long policyholders have been with Popelka.
  Choice C is a possible criticism because the argument doesn't address the possibility that other insurance companies might offer even bigger savings.
  Choice D is incorrect because the argument doesn't make any assumptions about how accurately the policyholders estimated their savings.
  Choice E is a possible criticism because the advertisement doesn't address the possibility that the sample of policyholders surveyed is not representative of all policyholders.
  Both choice C and choice E could be valid criticisms, but choice C seems more directly related to the argument presented in the advertisement.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The advertisement is based on a survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders who reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it may overlook alternative explanations for the reported savings or fail to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  Answer choice A points out a possibility that is consistent with the argument, but is not a criticism of the argument itself.
  Answer choice B suggests that the argument takes for granted something that may not be true, but it does not directly address a flaw in the argument.
  Answer choice C is a plausible criticism of the argument, as it suggests that the argument fails to consider a relevant alternative course of action.
  Answer choice D is not directly relevant to the argument's vulnerability to criticism.
  Answer choice E suggests a possibility that may weaken the argument, but it is not a criticism of the argument itself.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The second group of doctors are arguing that high levels of bilirubin should be allowed because the brain has its own natural defenses.
  If it can be shown that some diseases can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, it would support the position of the second group of doctors.
  Option A does not provide any support for either group.
  Option C provides information about the occurrence of bilirubin but it does not directly support any group.
  Option D provides information about the potential benefits of bilirubin, but it does not support either group.
  Option E provides information about the agreement of doctors on what is considered excessive levels of bilirubin, but it does not directly support either group.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high because the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  We need to find an option that shows the strength of the brain's natural defenses against bilirubin.
  Option B says that some diseases can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, so the strength of the brain's natural defenses is crucial.
  Therefore, option B most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The second group of doctors argues that bilirubin levels don’t need to be reduced because the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
To support this argument, we need an answer choice that shows that the natural defenses of the brain are strong enough to prevent bilirubin from entering.
Option B seems to be the answer as it shows that some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  The question asks for the choice that most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors.
  Choice A does not support the second group of doctors' position.
  Choice B supports the second group of doctors' position since it suggests that in some cases, bilirubin might enter the brain.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D suggests that bilirubin has benefits to newborns.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high.
  This is because the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  Therefore, we need to choose an option that supports this argument.
  Option B states that some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  This implies that the second group of doctors may have a point in arguing for allowing bilirubin levels in newborns to remain high.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels to remain high, as the brain's natural defense can prevent bilirubin from entering into the brain. To support this argument, we need to find a statement that talks about the natural defense mechanism of the brain. 
Option B states that some diseases can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter. Therefore, it most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high.
  They argue that the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering the brain.
  We need to find the option that supports this position.
  Option A talks about a treatment to reduce high levels of bilirubin but does not support the position of the second group.
  Option B supports the second group's position as it states that some diseases can weaken the brain's natural defenses that prevent bilirubin from entering the brain.
  Option C is not related to the position of either group.
  Option D is also not related to the position of either group.
  Option E also does not relate to the position of either group.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The second group of doctors argue for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high because the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  We need to find the answer that most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors.
  Option B provides a reason which weakens the brain's natural defense and allows bilirubin to enter.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  To support this argument we need an option that provides further evidence that the natural defenses of the brain protect the infants from the harmful effects of bilirubin.
  Option B provides evidence that some diseases may weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter. This strengthens the argument of the second group of doctors that bilirubin levels should be allowed to remain high.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argue that high bilirubin levels should be allowed since the brain's natural defense prevent bilirubin from entering.
  We need to find an option that supports the idea that the brain can handle high levels of bilirubin.
  Option B suggests some diseases in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, which supports the second group's position.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages based on better performance of Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) in comparison with Group B (composed of college students) on a memory task.
  A piece of information that does not support the conclusion or cannot be used to verify the conclusion is the least helpful.
  Option A states that there was the same number of people in each group. It is a relevant piece of information and does not contradict or weaken the conclusion.
  Option B indicates that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups. It is helpful in establishing that the same standard was applied to both groups, so it is not the least helpful.
  Option C suggests that there were no persons more than forty years old in the college student group, which is not relevant to the argument, but it does not contradict or weaken the conclusion.
  Option D states that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls. It is relevant to the argument and does not contradict or weaken the conclusion.
  Option E suggests that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls. It is relevant to the argument and does not contradict or weaken the conclusion.
  Therefore, the least helpful option is C, which provides irrelevant information. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that Group A performed better than Group B in remembering to make phone calls at a specified time.
  The evidence is that there was only one lapse in Group A and fourteen lapses in Group B.
  We need to look for an option that does not support the conclusion.
  Option A is helpful and supports the conclusion.
  Option B is also helpful and supports the conclusion.
  Option C could potentially be helpful but it does not have any relation to the conclusion.
  Option D is helpful and supports the conclusion.
  Option E is also helpful and supports the conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Among college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence provided is that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) made only one lapse, while Group B (composed of college students) had fourteen lapses.
  The evidence suggests that older people are better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than college students.
  Therefore, we are looking for the least helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  A, B, and D all seem to provide important information for establishing the conclusion.
  C is not relevant to the conclusion.
  E, if true, would strengthen the conclusion, not weaken it.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory doesn't suffer as a person ages, based on the study that shows Group A performed better than Group B in remembering to make a phone call at a specific time.
  We want to find the least helpful statement in establishing the conclusion.
  If any of the statements contradict or weaken the conclusion, then it's helpful.
  If none of them contradict or weaken the conclusion, then the least relevant statement is the least helpful.
  Statement A is helpful because it confirms that the number of people in each group didn't skew the result.
  Statement B is helpful because it confirms the consistency of the experimental conditions for each group.
  Statement C is helpful because it confirms that the college students are younger than the elderly persons in Group A.
  Statement D is helpful because it confirms that each group had the same opportunity to make the phone call.
  Statement E is the only statement that doesn't add any new information relevant to the conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that Group A is better than Group B in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  We need to choose the option that is least helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Options A, B, D, and E all provide support for the conclusion.
  Option C is unrelated to the conclusion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The study compared two groups of participants: Group A (65-75 years old) and Group B (college students).
  Group A had only one lapse, while Group B had fourteen lapses.
  We need to find the option that undermines the conclusion above.
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  So, if we find an option that suggests that the two groups do not differ in memory, then it would weaken the conclusion.
Action: Answer("B") 
Option B is the correct answer because it suggests that there is no difference in memory between the two groups. If the same group of researchers answered the calls made by both Group A and Group B, then there is no way to know if the memory difference is due to age or something else, such as the researchers being more lenient with Group A.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The fact that one group had less lapse than the other can be used to support the conclusion.
  We need to find an option that does not help in establishing the conclusion.
  Option A, D and E seem to strengthen the conclusion.
  Option B is also important but not the least helpful since it provides valuable information about the study.
  Option C, however, does not provide any useful information about memory or age.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The study involved two groups of people - Group A (65 to 75 years old) and Group B (college students).
  The objective of both groups was to make a telephone call at a specified time.
  Group A had only one lapse while Group B had 14 lapses.
  This suggests that Group A was better at remembering to make the telephone call at the specified time, indicating that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  We need to identify the option that is least helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  
Option A: This option assures us that there is no bias in the selection of the groups. Hence it is helpful.
Option B: This option assures us that there is no bias in the responses to the calls made by the two groups. Hence it is helpful.
Option C: This option may suggest that all college students were less than 40 years old, but this does not impact the conclusion drawn from the study. Hence it is helpful.
Option D: This option assures us that both groups had the same resources to make the call. Hence it is helpful.
Option E: This option assures us that both groups received the same instructions and amount of time. Hence it is helpful.

Therefore, all options are helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The researchers answering the calls is irrelevant.
  Having the same number of people in each group, unrestricted access to telephones, and instructions given approximately the same amount of time before the calls were made are all helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
  If the college students were all over forty years old, and the elderly persons were all younger than sixty-five, it might be argued that the two study groups were not properly matched.
  Thus, the option that is LEAST helpful in establishing the conclusion above is C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The researchers answering the calls is not related to the memory of Group A and B.
  The same number of people in each group seems to be important as the difference will affect the result.
  The age of the college students is not relevant as the comparison is between two groups.
  The unrestricted access to telephones is required for both groups to make the calls.
  The timing of instructions is important to ensure both groups had the same amount of time to prepare.
  Therefore, the least helpful choice is B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.
Question: The reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: widespread cynicism is beneficial to the wellbeing of society
  B: cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the am01mt of information one has about them
  C: the work of contemporary journalists reflects a cynicism that is not really genuine
  D: any accurate description of human bebavior portrays it as selfish
  E: cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society
Response 0:
Thought:
The commentator argues that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of society's well-being because journalists have always been cynics.

The commentator's argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that cynicism about the motives of powerful people may have increased over time due to an increase in available information.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The commentator claims that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism as follows:
    - It is possible that widespread cynicism is not beneficial to the wellbeing of society.
    - It is possible that cynicism about the motives of powerful people does not increase with the amount of information one has about them.
    - It is possible that the work of contemporary journalists does not necessarily reflect genuine cynicism.
    - It is possible that not any accurate description of human behavior portrays it as selfish.
    - It is possible that cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has not always had a negative effect on the well-being of society.
  Among these, the most likely criticism is that the reasoning overlooks the possibility that cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has a negative effect on the well-being of society.
  Therefore, the answer is E: cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The commentator is arguing that the cynicism of journalists cannot be blamed for undermining society's well-being because journalists have always been cynical.
  However, this argument overlooks one possibility.
  To determine the correct answer, we need to consider an alternate possibility that the commentator is overlooking.
  Choice A is not plausible because cynicism generally has a negative effect on well-being.
  Choice B seems to be a possible alternate possibility that the commentator is overlooking. If this is true, then the commentator's argument is flawed.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is not related to the argument.
  Choice E is similar to choice A, and the commentator's argument is arguing against this claim.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the amount of information one has about them. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The commentator argues that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being.
  He defends the argument by stating that journalists have always been cynics and that today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.
  The argument does not take into account the possibility that the cynicism of journalists has a negative effect on society.
  Therefore, the answer is E: cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society.
Action: Answer("E")

  The commentator argues that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor for undermining society's well-being because journalists have always been cynics.
  The commentator does not consider the possibility that the increased exposure to cynicism in modern journalism can have a negative impact on society.
  To criticize the commentator's argument, we need to find an option that points out this oversight.
  Option B is suggesting that cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the amount of information one has about them, which could be the case in modern journalism where more information is available.
  Therefore, B is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The commentator argues that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot contribute to the undermining of society's well-being.
  The commentator supports this argument by claiming that journalists have always been cynics.
  The commentator further claims that contemporary journalists are more restrained in their cynicism than their predecessors.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that some factors have changed over time, making the cynicism of contemporary journalists more harmful than it was in the past.
  The answer should identify this possibility.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The commentator argues that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being. The premise of the commentator's argument is that journalists have always been cynics and today's journalists are more restrained than their predecessors. The commentator's argument does not consider the possibility that the cynicism of contemporary journalists may have negative effects on society. Therefore, we need to select the answer that reflects the possibility that the commentator's argument overlooks.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The commentator argues that the claim that the cynicism of contemporary journalists undermines our society's well-being is absurd because journalists have always been cynics, and today's journalists are more restrained than their predecessors.
  The commentator's argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that the cynicism of contemporary journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society.
  Therefore, the answer is E: cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
The commentator claims that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being because journalists have always been cynics, and today's journalists are more restrained than their predecessors. However, the commentator fails to consider the possibility that cynicism may have a more significant or different effect on society now than it did in the past. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The commentator argues that the cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics.
  The commentator's argument overlooks the possibility that the cynicism of journalists could have had a negative effect on society in the past and could still have such an effect today. 
  An answer choice that reflects the above thought would be the best answer.
  E: cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society is a possible answer.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Resident: Data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in our town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe. Hence, at least 60 percent of our town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Question: The reasoning in the resident's argument is flawed in that the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the town has a relatively small number of houses
  B: inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe
  C: structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage
  D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe
  E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage
Response 0:
Thought:
  The resident's argument states that 30% of houses have inadequate site drainage and another 30% of houses have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The conclusion is drawn that at least 60% of the houses in the town have a problem and could threaten their integrity.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  Therefore, the answer is D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have a problem that could threaten their integrity.
  The evidence presented is that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects.
  The argument seems to overlook the possibility that some houses have neither of these problems.
  This possibility could undermine the conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The resident's argument says that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The argument concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have a problem that threatens their integrity.
  The argument fails to consider the possibility that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects.
  Therefore, the answer is D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The resident's argument concludes that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem.
  The argument is based on the fact that 30 percent of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that make them unsafe.
  Answer choice D casts doubt on the argument by suggesting that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects.
  If many houses do not have any problems, then the conclusion that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have problems is undermined.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The resident is claiming that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  According to the resident, 30 percent of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects.
  The argument might overlook the possibility that a house could have both inadequate site drainage and structural defects.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The resident is concerned about the integrity of the houses in the town.
  The resident assumes that the 30% with inadequate site drainage and 30% with structural defects are mutually exclusive; this is not true.
  Furthermore, the resident assumes that no houses have both issues, which is not specified.
  The question is asking what the argument overlooks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B supports the resident's argument.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is a possibility that the argument overlooks.
  Choice E is a possibility that the argument overlooks.
  Therefore, the answer is D or E.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The resident's argument claims that at least 60% of houses in the town have some kind of problem.
  The data indicates that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage.
  The data indicates that 30% of the houses have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The argument does not consider any other scenarios.
  If there are houses that do not have any of the mentioned problems, then the resident's argument could be flawed.
  Therefore, the answer is D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The resident's argument concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity based on two premises: 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects.
  The argument assumes the houses in the town only have two types of problems: inadequate site drainage and structural defects.
  The correct answer should point out that there may be other types of problems that these houses may have.
  Choice D suggests that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe, which is a possibility that the resident's argument has overlooked.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The resident claims that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects.
  He concludes that at least 60% of the houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  However, the argument overlooks the possibility that some houses may not have any of these problems.
  Choice D suggests this possibility, which is a valid objection to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The resident's argument concludes that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have a problem threatening their integrity based on two premises: 30 percent of the houses have inadequate drainage and 30 percent have structural defects.
  The argument assumes that these two conditions are independent of each other.
  The correct answer choice will identify a possibility that undermines this assumption.
  Answer choice E identifies a possibility that some houses have both structural defects and inadequate drainage, so the two conditions are not independent.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question asks for an explanation for why the rarer species of trees tend to survive longer than the common ones.
  Choice A provides a possible explanation for why the most common species exists and thrives in the forest but does not explain why the rarest species survive longer.
  Choice B does not explain why the rarest species survive longer.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the question.
  Choice D provides an alternative explanation but does not explain why the rarest species survive longer.
  Choice E suggests that trees of the common species have more competition than the rare species, which could lead to the common species having a shorter lifespan. This could explain why the rarest species survive longer.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question asks us to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species. 
  The context explains that the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest reproduces the most, and trees of the species that are rarest there tend to survive longer.
  Option A provides a possible explanation for why the most common species reproduces the most.
  Option B is irrelevant to the question, as it is about reproduction, not survival.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the question, as it does not explain why the rarest species tends to survive longer.
  Option D provides a possible explanation for why the survival of trees of the rarer species is important for the recovery of tropical forests.
  Option E provides a possible explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species. 
  Option A and D explain why the most common species and the rarer species are important to the forest, but don't explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  Option E provides a possible explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species because they have less competition for the resources they need.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The study finds that trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  We need to explain why this pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
  Option E provides a plausible explanation for this pattern.
  If the common species have more competition for resources, then the rare species may have an advantage in terms of accessing resources, which could help them survive longer.
  None of the other options offer a clear explanation for the pattern.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Trees of a certain species need resources to survive, such as soil and sunlight.
  Trees of the common species have more competition for resources than trees of the rare species.
  The survival of trees of the rarest species can lead to easier recovery of a forest.
  Therefore, competition for resources may be why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  None of the choices clearly explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
  However, the choice that provides a reason for the survival of the rarest species may be the best answer.
  Choice A provides a reason for the survival of the most common species but does not explain why the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the study's findings.
  Choice C provides additional information about the study but does not explain why the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  Choice D explains how the survival of trees of the rarest species benefits the forests but does not explain why they survive longer.
  Choice E provides a reason why the trees of the rare species may survive longer than trees of the common species.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question asks for an explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
  The study found that regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest, trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  Choice A does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  Choice B is irrelevant.
  Choice C does not provide any relevant information.
  Choice D provides some information but does not explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  Choice E provides a possible explanation as trees of the common species have more competition for resources.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The study found that rare species tend to survive longer, even if they are not the most common species.
  We need to find an option that explains why trees of the rare species tend to survive longer than those of the most common species.
  Option A explains why the most common species thrive and not why the rarest species survive longer.
  Option B is not relevant as it does not explain why the rarest species survive longer.
  Option C is not relevant to the question.
  Option D tells us that the survival of rarer species is important for the recovery of tropical forests but does not explain why they survive longer.
  Option E is the most suitable answer as it provides a reason for why the rare species tend to survive longer by pointing out that they do not have as much competition for resources as the common species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question asks for an explanation of why trees of rare species tend to survive longer in tropical forests.
  The study found that regardless of the species, the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  The explanation should best account for the survival of the rarest species.
  Choice A explains why a species is the most common, but does not explain why rare species tend to survive longer.
  Choice B is irrelevant as it talks about reproduction, not survival.
  Choice C is irrelevant as it only provides a limitation of the study.
  Choice D explains the benefits of survival of the rarest species, but not why they tend to survive longer.
  Choice E provides a possible explanation for the survival of the rarest species in tropical forests.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The study found that the trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  The question asks for an explanation of this pattern.
  If trees of the rarest species have a higher survival rate, it could be due to a competitive advantage over the more common species.
  Option E provides a possible explanation for this competitive advantage.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The study found that regardless of which species is the most common and which is the rarest, the rarest species tend to survive longer than the most common species.
  The question asks for a possible explanation of this phenomenon.
  Choice A provides a possible explanation, but it does not explain why the rarest species would survive longer than the most common species.
  Choice B is irrelevant.
  Choice C is also irrelevant.
  Choice D provides a possible explanation, but it does not explain why the rarest species would survive longer than the most common species.
  Choice E, on the other hand, provides a possible explanation that the trees of the common species have more competition for resources, which could explain why they do not survive as long as the trees of the rarest species.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Thought:
To draw the conclusion of the argument properly, we need to find an assumption that makes sense in the context given.
The Ethicist's argument is that we should only praise or blame someone for their action if we have enough information about the events that led to that action. Thus, we need to find an answer that shows that this is true and relevant to the argument.
Option A is a bit extreme, and It is not confirmed to the argument that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions caused by conditions beyond their control.
Option B does not provide any relevant information that is required to draw the conclusion of the argument properly.
Option C restates the argument itself, and it doesn't provide any additional support.
Option D is incorrect as the argument states that we should praise or blame someone based on the events leading up to that action.
Option E is incorrect because the argument does not state that having more information necessarily means that we will not regard an action as freely performed.
Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that people can only be praised or blamed when we know a lot about the events that led to their actions.
  The assumption should enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B goes against the argument.
  Choice C is consistent with the argument but does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  Choice D is consistent with the argument and provides a reason to draw the conclusion.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the correct assumption is that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
The argument is that we need to know a lot about events leading up to an action before we blame or praise someone. 
The conclusion is related to Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed. 
The assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn is the one that supports the idea that knowledge of events does not affect whether the action is freely performed or not, and that we can still blame or praise people based on how freely they performed their actions.
Option B supports this idea, as it states that the determination of genuine responsibility for an act is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument states that in order to praise or blame someone for an action, we must know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The argument also states that Tolstoy's claim is wrong because knowing a lot about the events leading to an action does not mean that we cannot regard that action as freely performed.
  Therefore, the assumption that enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn should support the idea that knowing a lot about the events leading to an action does not contradict the idea that we can praise or blame someone for that action.
  Choice B fits this description because it states that whether someone is responsible for an action is not determined by how much information others have about the act.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The ethicist's argument is that we need to know a lot about the events that led to an action to be able to praise or blame a person for that action. 
  The assumption must justify that claim.
  Option A is close to the argument but is too general and goes beyond the scope of the argument.
  Option B doesn't support the argument since the argument is that having more information about an action justifies praise or blame.
  Option D is also close but it doesn't support that we can only be justified in praising or blaming a person when we regard that action as freely performed.
  Option E is also irrelevant because the argument is not about whether we know much or little about the events that led to an action.
  Therefore, the assumption that supports the argument is C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only justifiably praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The conclusion is that Tolstoy's claim is rash and should be rejected because it suggests that we can't regard an action as freely performed if we know a lot about its causes.
  The assumption required to properly draw this conclusion must defend the idea that we can, in fact, regard an action as freely performed even if we know a lot about the events leading up to it.
  Choice A is related to praise or blame but not to the notion of an action being freely performed.
  Choice B speaks to the notion of genuine responsibility but not to whether an action is freely performed.
  Choice C agrees with the argument made by the ethicist, but it does not defend it or enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  Choice D introduces the idea of responsibility but does not address the idea of whether an action is freely performed.
  Choice E suggests that if we know a lot about the events leading up to an action, we won't regard it as freely performed. This contradicts the conclusion of the argument.
  Therefore, none of the choices enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
The argument of the ethicist is that we can praise or blame someone for their action only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action. 
The answer choice that enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be drawn should support this claim.
Option A is about conditions beyond the control of the person, which is not relevant here.
Option B is talking about the determination of a person's responsibility, which is not relevant here.
Option C is similar to the argument made by the ethicist, but it doesn't support the claim that we can only be justified in praising or blaming someone when we know a lot about the events leading up to their action.
Option D is talking about the inclination to blame or praise someone, which is not relevant here.
Option E is the opposite of what the argument of the ethicist is saying. 
Hence, none of the options enable the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
As there is no best answer available, the most likely answer is C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
Response 7:
Thought:
The argument by the ethicist is that we need to know a lot about the events leading up to an action before we can praise or blame someone for that action. The assumption that would enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn is the one that supports the idea that it is only when we know a lot about the events leading up to an action that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for that action.
Option A is irrelevant to the conclusion of the argument because it is not about what people should or should not do, but about the conditions under which people should be praised or blamed.
Option B is also irrelevant because it is not about the knowledge required to determine responsibility.
Option C is restating the main argument of the ethicist rather than providing an assumption that would enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
Option D is also irrelevant because it is not about the knowledge required to determine responsibility.
Option E is irrelevant because it is about how little we know about the events leading up to an action.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument states that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  The conclusion is that Tolstoy's claim that knowing more about the events leading up to an action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed is rash.
  The assumption must be something that connects the premise to the conclusion.
  B connects the premise to the conclusion by saying whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
The argument is that we can only justify our praise or blame for a person's action if we have extensive knowledge about the events that led up to it.
To draw the conclusion of the argument, we need to find an assumption that supports it.
Option A, which states that people should not be subject to blame or praise for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control, does not relate to the argument.
Option B is a contender; it states that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. However, it does not support the argument directly.
Option C is also not a contender because it restates the argument.
Option D addresses the responsibility of a person for an action, which is immaterial to the argument.
Option E is also not a contender because it supports the view that the less we know about the events leading up to an action, the more likely we are to regard it as freely performed, which is opposite to the argument's conclusion.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The assertion by the economists is that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population can solve the problems caused by urbanization. 
  To support this assertion, we need to find an option that shows the effectiveness of trading goods and services over other approaches.
  Option A talks about subsidies to urban manufacturers but doesn't mention anything about trading, so this is not relevant.
  Option B is too general and doesn't relate specifically to the assertion.
  Option C supports the idea of trading by showing that a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization. 
  Option D suggests that problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are due to trade imbalances between countries, which is not relevant to the assertion. 
  Option E suggests that free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by urbanization, which goes against the economists' assertion.
  Therefore, the most relevant option is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically is an effective solution to the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  To support this assertion, we need a statement that shows how the suggested solution addresses the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  Choice C provides support for the assertion by stating that the scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The economists assert that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population for agricultural products previously produced domestically can solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  To support this assertion, we need a statement that shows that this approach would be effective.
  Option C states that a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization, which implies that trading for these products could provide a solution.
  Option A is irrelevant to the economists' assertion.
  Option B is too general and doesn't directly support the assertion.
  Option D is incorrect because the problems are caused by rural migration, not trade imbalances.
  Option E says free trade policies can exacerbate the problems, but it doesn't support the assertion that trading goods or services can solve the problems.
  Thus, option C is the most supportive of the economists' assertion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The economists' argument is that planners can solve the problems of urbanization by trading goods between urban and rural areas.
  The correct option should provide supports to the economists' argument.
  Option A is not related to the economists' argument.
  Option B is too extreme and irrelevant to the context.
  Option D is not related to the economists' argument.
  Option E contradicts the economists' argument.
  Option C says that agricultural products are central elements of many urbanization problems which means trading these products will solve such problems; this supports the economists' argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The economists' assertion is that planners could solve urbanization problems by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
  To support this assertion, we need a statement that shows the feasibility of trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population to obtain agricultural products.
  Therefore, the statement that would provide the most support for the economists' assertion is C. If there is a scarcity of agricultural products, it would make sense to trade goods produced by a predominantly urban population for agricultural products. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The economists suggest trading goods or services from urban areas to obtain agricultural products.
  To support this suggestion, we need to find a statement supports that trading goods or services from urban areas can effectively address the problems of urbanization.
  Choice A is not related to trading goods or services with rural areas, so it is not relevant to the question.
  Choice B is too general and does not provide any support to the economists' assertion.
  Choice C indicates that agricultural products are scarce due to urbanization, but it does not provide support to the economists' assertion.
  Choice D is not relevant to the assertion made by the economists, as it talks about trade imbalances between countries.
  Choice E suggests that free trade policies can worsen the problems caused by urbanization, which supports the economists' assertion that trading goods or services can help solve these problems.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by an urban population for domestic agricultural products can solve the problems resulting from urbanization.
  To support their assertion, the answer should indicate that this approach is effective.
  Choice (C) suggests that a scarcity of agricultural products is central to the problems caused by urbanization. If the approach suggested by economists can help address this scarcity, it would support their assertion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The assertion made by economists is that trading goods or services produced by the urban population for agricultural products can address the problems of urbanization.
  The question is asking for the option that provides the most support for this assertion by the economists.
  Option A does not provide any support for the assertion made by the economists.
  Option B is irrelevant and does not provide any support to the assertion made by the economists.
  Option C provides support to the assertion that trading goods or services produced by the urban population for agricultural products could be an effective solution to the problems caused by urbanization.
  Option D is irrelevant and does not provide any support to the assertion made by the economists.
  Option E suggests that free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization, which is contrary to the assertion made by the economists.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The economists suggest trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population to obtain agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
  The best answer is the one that supports this assertion.
  A doesn't support the assertion of trading goods or services.
  B is too general and doesn't relate to the issue.
  C provides support in favor of trading goods or services for agricultural products.
  D talks about problems due to trade imbalances between countries, which is not related to the assertion.
  E talks about free trade policies and doesn't relate to the issue.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The assertion of the economists is that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population is an effective way to solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  To support this assertion, we need a statement that shows the effectiveness of this approach.
  Choice A is not directly related to the assertion of the economists.
  Choice B is a broad statement and does not provide any support for the assertion of the economists.
  Choice C is directly related to the assertion of the economists, as it suggests that a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization. This statement implies that trading for agricultural products could effectively solve these problems.
  Choice D is not related to the assertion of the economists as it talks about trade imbalances between countries.
  Choice E suggests that free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization, which goes against the economists' assertion.
  Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Thought:
  The pharmacist argues that melatonin supplements work and that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as people age.
  The pharmacist concludes that the manufacturers' claims are correct.
  The argument seems flawed as it makes a logical leap between a correlation and causation.
  There may be other factors that cause the decrease in melatonin, not necessarily aging.
  Thus, the pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon (aging) with its cause (less melatonin production).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The pharmacist concludes that the claims of melatonin supplement manufacturers are evidently correct because a study shows that most symptoms of insomnia are alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  The study's conclusion does not explicitly support the claim that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  Therefore, the pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The pharmacist's argument suggests that manufacturers' claims are correct because melatonin helps with insomnia.
  However, the argument does not provide evidence to support the manufacturers' claims.
  The argument assumes that the reason that melatonin helps with insomnia is that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  However, the argument does not provide evidence to support this assumption.
  Therefore, the argument seems to confuse an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The pharmacist argues that most insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  The pharmacist concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  The pharmacist's argument is flawed because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.
  The study shows that melatonin alleviates symptoms of insomnia, but it does not show that older adults produce less melatonin in their pineal gland.
  Therefore, the pharmacist's argument confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Action: Answer("D") 
Response 4:
Thought:
The pharmacist argues that the claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because a recent study showed that most insomnia symptoms are alleviated by ingesting melatonin. 
However, the study does not prove that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages, which is what the manufacturers claim.
Therefore, the pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
The answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that the large study supports the claims of manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  The argument does not infer from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect.
  The argument does not rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased.
  The argument does not depend on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.
  The argument does not confuse an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The argument does rely on a sample that is unrepresentative since it is only studying people aged 65-81. 
  Therefore, the answer is E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The pharmacist's argument states that most of insomnia's symptoms are alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  The pharmacist's argument assumes that the melatonin supplements are the same as the melatonin produced naturally by the pineal gland.
  The argument concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct.
  However, this conclusion is flawed because the argument does not provide any evidence that the melatonin supplements are the same as the melatonin produced naturally by the pineal gland.
  Therefore, the argument relies on an assumption that is not supported by evidence.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The argument states that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements regarding the hormone are correct.
The argument relies on a study that showed the alleviation of symptoms for people who ingested melatonin.
The argument concludes that the claim regarding the production of melatonin as one ages is correct.
The argument seems to be logically valid.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The pharmacist argues that a study showed melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms, and that manufacturers' claims that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  The pharmacist's conclusion seems to be that since melatonin helps with insomnia, and melatonin production decreases as the pineal gland ages, the manufacturers' claims are correct.
  The argument seems to confuse an effect of a phenomenon with its cause, since it assumes that decreased melatonin production is what causes aging.
  Therefore, the answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The pharmacist concludes that manufacturers' claims are correct because a study shows that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in older adults.
  The study does not mention anything about the pineal gland producing less melatonin as it ages.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are effective at relieving some back pain because most patients in the treatment group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the control group did.
  We are looking for a statement that will most strongly counter this argument.
  If it is true that the patients in the treatment group only reported an improvement because they knew they were being treated, then the magnets may not have been effective at all.
  Therefore, the strongest counter to the physician's argument is A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  The question asks for the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.
  If something is true that undermines the physician's conclusion, then it would be the strongest counter.
  Answer choice A is a well-known phenomenon called the placebo effect. It does not specifically address the use of magnets for back pain. 
  Answer choice B provides an alternative treatment for chronic back pain but does not directly address the use of magnets.
  Answer choice C is a limitation of the scope of the experiment but does not contradict the fact that the treatment reduced back pain.
  Answer choice D may raise concerns about the credibility of the experiment, but it does not directly contradict the outcome.
  Answer choice E suggests that the variability in the causes of chronic back pain could have influenced the results.
  Answer choice E provides an alternative explanation for the reduction in pain, which contradicts the physician's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  The question asks for the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.
  If true, the counter should weaken the physician's argument.
  Option A states that a patient's improvement in his or her condition may not be due to the treatment given.
  The physician's argument is based only on the patient's report.
  Therefore, if the report is influenced by external factors, the argument becomes weak.
  Hence, option A is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A would weaken the physician's argument but does not counter it directly.
  B does not directly counter the physician's argument.
  C would weaken the physician's argument but does not counter it directly.
  D would weaken the physician's argument but does not counter it directly.
  E could counter the physician's argument because the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could have caused the different results between the two groups.
  Therefore, E is the logical strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The physician's argument is based on an experiment where the group with magnets had a significant reduction in pain compared to the other group.
  We need to find a choice that contradicts or weakens the physician's argument.
  Choices A, B, and D do not address the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing back pain, so they can be eliminated.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument, so it can be eliminated as well.
  Choice E, which suggests that there was wide variation in the specific causes of chronic back pain, could be a potential explanation for the difference in pain reduction between the two groups.
  Therefore, E is the strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain and supports the argument with evidence.
  The counter-argument should provide evidence that negates the argument and shows that magnetic fields are not effective at relieving back pain.
  Option A is not a strong counter as it doesn't provide evidence that negates the physician's argument. Option A is related to the placebo effect.
  Option B is not a strong counter as it provides an alternative treatment, but it doesn't negate the physician's argument that magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain.
  Option C is not a strong counter as it only refers to other areas where magnetic fields have not been studied to relieve pain.
  Option D is not a strong counter as it only refers to the scientists' belief and not to the results of the experiment.
  Option E provides evidence that negates the physician's argument. If there was a wide variation in the specific causes of the back pain, the effectiveness of the magnetic field cannot be generalised to all types of back pain.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  A logically strong counter to this argument would be a statement that undermines the evidence or logic presented in the argument.
  Choice A suggests that the patient's improvement could be due to a placebo effect, rather than the magnets.
  Choice B is not a logical counter because it only presents a belief of most physicians, and not data or evidence that proves magnets are not effective.
  Choice C is not a logical counter because it only states that there is no evidence supporting the effectiveness of magnets in other areas, but it does not contradict the argument for back pain.
  Choice D is not a logical counter because it only provides background information about the scientists involved in the experiment, but it does not contradict the results or methodology of the experiment.
  Choice E suggests that the wide variation in causes of chronic back pain could have influenced the results of the experiment, making it difficult to attribute the reduction in pain solely to the magnets.
  Therefore, the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  In order to counter the argument, we need the statement that would shake the physician's argument at its core.
  Both option A and D are irrelevant to the argument given by the physician.
  Option B is just a belief of most physicians and does not provide any evidence to counter the physician's argument.
  Option C is not relevant because the focus is on back pain and not pain in other areas.
  Option E is the strongest counter because it shows that the wide variation in specific causes of chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could have impacted the results and therefore the experiment may not have been a true representation of back pain sufferers in general.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  To counter the physician's argument, we need to choose an option that weakens the argument.
  Option A may weaken the argument, but it is not necessarily the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.
  Option B is irrelevant. Even if medication is more effective than magnets, that does not necessarily mean that magnets are not effective at all.
  Option C is irrelevant as well. The argument is about whether magnetic fields are effective at reducing back pain, not about whether they are effective at reducing pain in other areas.
  Option D may strengthen the argument because it suggests that the scientists who helped design the experiment believed in the effectiveness of magnetic fields before the experiment was conducted.
  Option E may weaken the argument because the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain could have affected the results of the experiment.
  Option E is the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The physician argued that the magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  We need to find a statement that weakens this argument the most.
  Option A is a possible explanation for why patients in the first group reported reduced pain, which weakens the argument.
  Option B is about the belief of most physicians, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Option C is irrelevant to the argument as it talks about other areas of pain.
  Option D might strengthen the argument but does not weaken it.
  Option E suggests that the variation in the causes of the chronic back pain might affect the results, which weakens the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the surprising result?
Choices:
  A: For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
  B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
  C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  Option A is irrelevant because it refers to shopper's attention, not the preference for a brand.
  Option B is irrelevant because it refers to customers being attracted by quality and service, not the price of the hammers.
  Option C is irrelevant because it refers to customers who already bought the Maxlast hammers.
  Option D could be a possible explanation, but it is not enough to explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale is not enough to motivate shoppers to visit a store. Therefore, the sale of Maxlast hammers did not motivate shoppers to buy them. Instead, shoppers may have purchased Styron hammers because they were on the same shelf as the Maxlast hammers and were not on sale, meaning that shoppers presumed they were of better quality than Maxlast hammers.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  The Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  We need to find the option that explains the surprising result.
  Options A, B, and E do not provide a direct explanation for the surprising result.
  Option D is unlikely to be the primary reason for the sales result.
  Option C implies that the sale of Maxlast hammers motivated customers to purchase hammers, but they may have purchased Styron hammers instead due to their quality or service.
  Therefore, the most likely explanation is option C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The sale on Maxlast hammers was placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  Shoppers do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise for the first several seconds after they enter the store (choice A), but the sale was just inside the entrance.
  Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices (choice B) is not relevant to the sale of Maxlast and Styron hammers.
  Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time (choice C) is relevant but does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers (choice D) is also relevant but does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  If a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store (choice E), then it is likely that most customers who bought Maxlast hammers were already planning to buy a hammer, but they decided to take advantage of the sale. However, since the sale was just inside the entrance, shoppers saw both the sale and the regular-priced Styron hammers, which explains why Styron hammers slightly outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers.
  Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  The question is asking for the explanation as to why the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  Option A does not have a direct correlation to the surprising result.
  Option B suggests that the quality and service is more important to customers than low prices hence it cannot explain the surprising result.
  Option C suggests that customers commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, but it cannot explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option D suggests that the hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers but does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option E suggests that a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, but it does not have a direct correlation to the surprising result.
  Therefore, the most plausible explanation for the surprising result is that the customers were already aware of the Maxlast brand and its quality, so they did not need to buy the hammers on sale, while the sale of Maxlast hammers attracted new customers who did not know the quality of the Styron hammers to the store and they preferred to buy the Styron hammers at their usual price.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the more expensive Styron hammers outsold the cheaper Maxlast hammers, even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Choice A seems irrelevant to the surprising result.
  Choice B suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices, which is not consistent with the fact that the Maxlast hammers are usually as popular as the Styron hammers.
  Choice C suggests that the sale on Maxlast hammers was not the main reason why people bought hammers.
  Choice D provides a possible explanation for why the sale of Maxlast hammers may not have been as effective as expected.
  Choice E seems irrelevant to the surprising result.
  Therefore, the best answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers, which retained their usual price and location, slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers, which were on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  Option C is not a good explanation because it suggests that the sale of Maxlast hammers helped to increase the sales of Styron hammers.
  Option D is irrelevant because it talks about advertising the sale of Maxlast hammers, not about the Styron hammers' sales.
  Option B is not a good explanation because it suggests that customers are more interested in quality and service than low prices, which does not explain why the Styron hammers sold better.
  Option A and E are reasonable explanations that suggest that the location of the hammers and the store layout may have affected the sales. However, option E is a generalization and not a specific explanation for the hardware store's situation.
  Therefore, the most likely explanation is option A because it specifically addresses the hardware store's situation, suggesting that the customers did not take detailed notice of the merchandise when they entered the store.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers (which were not on sale) outsold the Maxlast hammers (which were on sale).
  Choice A, although interesting, does not explain why the Styron hammers sold more than the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it provides information about customers' preferences but does not explain the surprising result.
  Choice C suggests that the sale of Maxlast hammers could be the reason why Styron hammers outsold it. However, it does not explain how Styron hammers were able to sell more than Maxlast hammers.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it does not explain how Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Choice E indicates that a single item on sale may not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store. This choice explains why customers may not have visited the store regularly to take advantage of the sale, resulting in fewer sales of Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers, despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  Option C provides a possible explanation that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option D provides a possible explanation that the hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers, which may have motivated customers to specifically come to the store to buy Maxlast hammers on sale, making them less likely to buy Styron hammers. This explains why Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The situation described is that Maxlast hammers are on sale and are placed in a display case just inside the store entrance, while Styron hammers are still in their usual location and price.
  However, Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  To explain this surprising result we should look for an answer that can reasonably explain why the Styron hammers sold better than the Maxlast hammers.
  Answer C suggests that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, which indicates that the sale was the main motivation for the purchase.
  Therefore, customers who wanted hammers during the sale already purchased the Maxlast hammers, so there were fewer customers left to buy them this week.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The stimulus states that the sale hammers were placed in a display case just inside the store entrance, so it suggests that most customers saw the sale hammers.
  The stimulus also states that both types of hammers are generally sold in roughly equal numbers.
  Choice A seems to be a weak explanation of why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the explanation because it talks about what attracts customers in general, but not about the sale of hammers.
  Choice C does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers. This choice gives another reason why people bought Maxlast hammers, but it could have been that the Styron hammers were more attractive to customers for some other reason.
  Choice D gives another reason why people may have been aware of the sale, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Choice E is a possible explanation. It suggests that a single item on sale would not motivate a special trip to the store. Therefore, customers who had an intention to buy a hammer before they entered the store might be more likely to buy the Styron hammers because they are located in their usual location.
  Therefore, the best answer is E.

  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez since he eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that the survey respondents were not biased in favor of Lopez, or that there were other factors at play that influenced the outcome of the election.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of bias in the survey respondents.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it only concerns the live audience's opinion and does not address the issue of bias in the survey respondents.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because it only concerns the voting patterns of people who watched the debate and does not address the issue of bias in the survey respondents.
  Choice D actually strengthens the argument because it suggests that Tanner had more support before the debate.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because the margin of victory does not address the issue of bias in the survey respondents.
  Therefore, None of the above undermines the argument as they all are irrelevant or strengthen the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find an option that weakens the link between the survey respondents and Lopez's eventual win.
  Option A is irrelevant because it does not weaken the link between the survey respondents and Lopez's eventual win.
  Option B could undermine the argument if the live audience is a representative sample of the voters. However, this is not necessarily true, so it is not a strong option.
  Option C could undermine the argument because it suggests that the survey respondents may have been biased in favor of Tanner instead of Lopez.
  Option D is irrelevant because it describes the viewers' opinions before the debate.
  Option E does not weaken the link between the survey respondents and Lopez's eventual win.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that viewers who thought that Lopez had made better arguments may have been biased.
  If most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been biased.
  Therefore, this choice would undermine the argument.
  The answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who thought that Lopez made better arguments may have been biased in favor of Lopez since he eventually won the election.
  To undermine this argument, an option is needed that suggests that the survey respondents were not biased.
  Option A is irrelevant since it doesn't address the argument.
  Option B doesn't necessarily refute the argument since the live audience may have a different opinion from the general public.
  Option C doesn't address the argument since it's about the voting pattern.
  Option D doesn't address the argument since it's about the prior preference of the viewers.
  Option E suggests that Lopez didn't win the election by a significant margin. If the margin is too narrow, then it can be argued that the survey respondents were not biased in favor of Lopez since he barely won the election.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey results may have been biased since Lopez won the election.
  In order to undermine this argument, we need an option that provides an alternative explanation for why Lopez won.
  Option A does not address the issue of bias in favor of Lopez.
  Option B addresses the argument, but it is not as strong as option C.
  Option C provides an alternative reason for why Lopez won that has nothing to do with the survey results.
  Option D is irrelevant since it concerns the viewers prior to the debate and not after.
  Option E does not provide any alternative explanation for why Lopez won.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is that the viewers who thought Lopez had better arguments may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B contradicts the argument, but it also doesn't undermine the argument.
  Option C could support the argument if it is assumed that the viewers who did not watch the debate were less biased than those who watched the debate.
  Option D could support the argument if it is assumed that the viewers who watched the debate did not change their minds during the debate.
  Option E supports the argument by suggesting that the election was close, and therefore the survey respondents who favored Lopez may have been biased in his favor.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the viewers were biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option A doesn't seem to have any impact on the argument.
  Option B might undermine the argument by implying that the bias was not in favor of Lopez but against Tanner.
  Option C might undermine the argument by suggesting that the viewers were not representative of the general population that voted.
  Option D might support the argument, but it doesn't seem strong enough to undermine it.
  Option E doesn't seem relevant to the argument.
  Option B and Option C are strong contenders, but Option C seems more likely to undermine the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is that the viewers who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find the choice that suggests that the viewers who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Choice A is irrelevant because the argument is not about whether most people voted or not.
  Choice B suggests the opposite of what the argument claims, which is that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. This choice supports the argument rather than undermine it.
  Choice C does not necessarily prove that the viewers were biased in favor of Lopez. It only suggests that the people who watched the debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate. So, it neither supports nor undermines the argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant because the argument is not about what the viewers said before the debate.
  Choice E suggests that the margin of Lopez's victory was very narrow. This also neither supports nor undermines the argument.
  Choice B is the best answer because it contradicts the argument and suggests that the viewers who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who thought Lopez had better arguments may have been biased.
  Option A is irrelevant because it does not concern the bias of the survey respondents.
  Option B, if true, does not necessarily undermine the argument that the survey respondents were biased, but rather provides evidence that the survey respondents may not have fully represented the views of the audience.
  Option C, if true, could support the argument because it suggests that the survey may not have been representative of the larger population.
  Option D, if true, may weaken the argument because it introduces the possibility that the survey respondents were not biased towards Lopez.
  Option E, if true, does not necessarily undermine the argument that the survey respondents were biased, but rather indicates that the election was close.
  Option D seems to weaken the argument by introducing the possibility that the survey respondents were not biased, therefore, it is the best answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is that the viewers who thought that Lopez had made the better arguments may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  We need to find an option that contradicts this argument.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument and does not change the logic of the argument.
  Option B is relevant, but it does not contradict the argument. It only provides another perspective on the debate.
  Option C does not contradict the argument. It only provides more information about the viewers who voted for Tanner.
  Option D might strengthen the argument but is not relevant to the argument.
  Option E is relevant because it contradicts the argument. If Lopez won the election by a very narrow margin, then it is less likely that the viewers who thought that Lopez had made the better arguments were biased in his favor.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument discusses whether the university president's speech was inflammatory and inappropriate.
  The conclusion is that the speech was not inappropriate unless there are independent reasons to deem the speech inflammatory.
  The argument is flawed in that it does not address other factors that could make the speech inappropriate.
  Choice A is not correct because the argument does not assume that the speech cannot be inappropriate if it is not inflammatory.
  Choice B is not correct because the argument is not discussing whether inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences.
  Choice C is not correct because the argument does not favor the university president's side.
  Choice D is not correct because the argument does not conclude that Riley's claim is false.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason the speech could be inappropriate is if it is inflammatory.
  Therefore, the answer is A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  The argument points out that Professor Riley has a long-standing feud with the president, but it doesn't necessarily mean that her testimony is false.
  The argument doesn't address whether an inflammatory speech could be inappropriate for some audiences or not.
  The argument doesn't show any bias towards the president's privileged standing.
  The argument doesn't conclude that Riley's claim is false.
  The argument doesn't address the possibility that Riley's animosity towards the president is well founded.
  Therefore, the argument is not flawed.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument is that Professor Riley's characterization of the university president's speech as inflammatory is not enough evidence to conclude that the speech was inappropriate.
  The argument says that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  The argument does not assert that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
  Nor does it assert that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences.
  The argument does not favor the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing.
  The argument does not conclude that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true.
  The argument is also not about whether Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices accurately describes the flaw in the argument.
Action: Answer("E") - selecting the best answer, even though it doesn't accurately describe the flaw.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that unless the president's speech was deemed inflammatory for independent reasons, it cannot be considered inappropriate.
  This assumes that the only reason for the speech to be inappropriate is if it was inflammatory; this may not be true.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
  The answer is A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that we should not conclude that the President's speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony and unless there are independent reasons to deem the speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  The argument does not take for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory, so A is incorrect.
  The argument does not address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences, so B is incorrect.
  The argument is not favoring the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing, so C is incorrect.
  The argument does not conclude that Riley's claim is false, so D is incorrect.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is about whether the university president's speech was inappropriate.
  Professor Riley said the speech was inappropriate because it was inflammatory.
  However, Riley and the president have a feud, so Riley's testimony may be biased.
  The argument concludes that unless there are independent reasons to deem the speech inflammatory, it is not true that the speech was inappropriate.
  The argument is flawed in that it assumes that the speech cannot be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
  Therefore, the answer is A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  The argument acknowledges that Riley has a long-standing feud with the president and that we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony.
  However, the argument does not take the possibility that the speech could be inappropriate even if it was not inflammatory.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is stating that we should not conclude that the speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony.
  The argument is also stating that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  Therefore, the argument implies that the speech could still be inappropriate for reasons other than being inflammatory.
  None of the answer choices above address this implication.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument acknowledges that the president's speech would be inappropriate if it were inflammatory.
  The argument also states that Professor Riley has a feud with the president, and therefore, her testimony may be biased.
  The argument concludes that we cannot assume the president's speech was inappropriate unless there are independent reasons to believe it was inflammatory.
  The argument does not have any flaws.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is that Riley's testimony alone does not prove that the university president's speech was inflammatory.
  The argument further states that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
  The argument does not assume that the speech cannot be inappropriate if it is not inflammatory, as the argument allows for there to be independent reasons to deem the speech inappropriate.
  The argument does not discuss whether inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences, as it is focused on whether the university president's speech was inappropriate based on Riley's testimony alone.
  The argument does not favor the university president's side in a dispute, as it notes that Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president and therefore her testimony may be biased.
  The argument does not conclude that Riley's claim is false, but rather that her testimony alone does not prove the speech was inflammatory.
  The argument does not address whether Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded, as the focus is on whether her testimony alone is sufficient to prove the speech was inflammatory.
  Therefore, the argument is not flawed.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The new computer program just tallied the number of paychecks issued by employers.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed.
  Some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses.
  Therefore, the new program may have counted multiple paychecks of some employees, leading to an overestimate of the number of people employed.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The new computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, so each employee who receives more than one paycheck will be counted more than once.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the government might have overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  The other answer choices lack support from the information given.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The new program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for overtime, and bonuses and commissions in addition to the regular paychecks.
  Therefore, the number of paychecks tallied by the program would exceed the number of people actually employed.
  Hence, the government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The new computer program uses the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X as its estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the employee's overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  Therefore, some employees in X received more than one paycheck per pay period.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  It is not clear whether the government's estimate of growth was accurate or not.
  However, it is clear that the government's estimate of the total number of people employed was higher than the actual number because some employees received more than one paycheck.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The new computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.
  The government reported that there was a large increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the total number of paychecks issued could be higher than the number of people actually employed.
  The number of paychecks tallied by the new program could be overstated.
  The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed could be overstated.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The new computer program counted the number of paychecks issued in X as an estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the number of paychecks issued would not represent the actual number of people employed in X.
  So, the government may have overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  The correct answer choice should reflect this conclusion.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The new computer program counted the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X as an estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  This means the number of paychecks issued does not necessarily equal the number of people employed.
  Therefore, the government's estimate may not be accurate.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The government of Country X started using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in the country.
The program counted the number of paychecks issued by employers in X to estimate employment.
In the first quarter, some employers in X issued multiple paychecks to employees.
Therefore, the government's estimate of employment based on the new program could be inaccurate.
Option A can be properly concluded from the information above.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The new computer program uses the number of paychecks to determine employment.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions.
  Therefore, the number of paychecks may be more than the number of employees.
  The government reported a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  It is possible that the increase was due to multiple paychecks issued to the same employees.
  Therefore, the government may have overestimated the total number of people employed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The new computer program counts the number of paychecks issued by the employers as the estimate of employment.
  The first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for bonuses, commissions, and overtime.
  Therefore, the program will perceive the multiple paychecks as separate employment.
  The government reports a large increase in employment in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  The government's report can be incorrect due to the program counting separate paychecks for bonuses, commissions, and overtime as separate employment.
  The answer is D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument talks about a decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer.
The argument assumes that the decline in market share means a decline in net income.
The argument states that the average income per dryer sold has remained the same.
The argument concludes that the net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
The argument makes a flawed assumption.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument presents that because of the decline in the market share, Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of hair dryers must be half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument does not mention anything about the total sales of the product.
  The argument also assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold is the same as it was 5 years ago.
  The argument does not provide any information about other products of Wilson Appliance.
  The argument does not mention anything about the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer.
  The argument does not provide any evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed because it is based on assumptions and does not provide enough specific information or evidence to support the conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that the net income from sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer must be only half of what it was 5 years ago because the product's sales have declined.
  However, it is not clear whether the total sales of hair dryers have declined or only Wilson Appliance's market share has declined.
  Also, there is no information about the profits of other hair dryer companies or Wilson Appliance's other products.
  The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has remained constant over the past 5 years, which may not be the case.
  The argument also does not provide any evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that since the market share of Wilson's hair dryer has decreased from 50% to 25%, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the last five years.
  The argument also assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument does not provide any information about the sales of other products of Wilson Appliance.
  The argument fails to consider the possibility that the price of Wilson's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed for multiple reasons.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the last 5 years.
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of its hair dryers is only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument does not mention the competition faced by Wilson Appliance's hair dryer.
  The argument does not provide information about the expenses or costs associated with producing or selling the hair dryer.
  The argument does not mention the possibility of changes in the market demand for hair dryers.
  Based on the analysis, the argument is flawed because it assumes that the decline in market share is the sole reason for the decline in net income.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer sales went down from 50% to 25% in five years.
  The argument further assumes that the total sales have decreased instead of simply the market share.
  The argument then states that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the past 5 years.
  Finally, the argument concludes that the company’s net income must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument does not discuss other factors that could have impacted the company's net income.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's product accounts for only 25% of such sales. However, it has not been said if the total sales declined or not.
  The argument states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, yet the net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument assumes that this change is caused by the decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer. There could be other factors affecting the net income.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of hair dryers must now be only half of what it was 5 years ago, due to the decline in market share and no change in average net income per sale.
  The argument assumes that the only reason for the decline in net income is the decline in market share.
  The argument does not discuss the possibility of other hair dryer manufacturers entering the market or existing manufacturers increasing their market share.
  The argument does not provide any information about the total sales of hair dryers in the market.
  The argument mentions that the average net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  So, the reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument does not provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: does not provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has declined in sales over the last five years.
  It also states that Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of the hair dryer must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is the only reason for the decline in net income.
  However, there may be other reasons for the decline in net income such as increased competition, production costs, and marketing expenses.
  The argument overlooks all the other factors that could have contributed to the decline in net income.
  Thus, the reasoning in the argument is flawed.
  The answer is E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that the decline in market share of Wilson's hair dryer alone caused the company's net income to be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the last 5 years.
  The argument also assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  It is likely that some of Wilson's competitors have gained market share over the past 5 years.
  It is possible that the retail price of Wilson's hair dryer has decreased over the past 5 years.
  The argument does not provide any information about Wilson's other products.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed because it oversimplifies the reasons for Wilson's decline in net income.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Critic: The recent biography of Shakespeare does not explain what is of most interest about him. It is by an expert on the history of Elizabethan England, and so does a good job of showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time. But it does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
Question: The conclusion of the argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: There is no way to know what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
  B: The life of the average man in Elizabethan England is uninteresting.
  C: Shakespeare was very different from the other men of his time.
  D: A biography should always focus on what makes its subject distinctive.
  E: What is most interesting about Shakespeare is what made him different from his contemporaries.
Response 0:
Thought:
The critic is saying that the biography does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
Therefore, the critic assumes that what is most interesting about Shakespeare is what made him different from his contemporaries.
Thus, the conclusion of the argument can be properly drawn if the assumption is made that E is true.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The scientist argues that iguana species in a group of islands near Australia came from the Americas by rafting.
  If there is evidence that contradicts the scientists' argument, then the argument is weakened.
  A, B, and D do not contradict the scientist's argument, and E is irrelevant.
  If iguanas frequently raft long distances, it makes the argument stronger, not weaker.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The argument is that the iguana species on the island must have come from the Americas.
To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts or calls into question this claim.
A: This statement doesn't challenge the argument about the origin of the iguanas.
B: If genetic analysis shows that the iguanas on the island are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, it doesn't necessarily mean that they didn't come from the Americas.
C: The rarity of the documented cases doesn't prove that the iguanas in question couldn't have rafted across the ocean.
D: This statement supports the argument by showing that fossils of closely related species have been found in Australia.
E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about the iguanas on the islands.
Therefore, the answer is B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the small group of islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer that suggests the iguana species could have come to the islands via a method other than rafting on floating debris from the Americas.
  Choice A is irrelevant because the argument is only concerned with the iguana species.
  Choice B, if anything, strengthens the argument by pointing out that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, making it less likely that they evolved separately.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because the argument is not concerned with how common documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances are.
  Choice D weakens the argument because it suggests that iguana species closely related to those inhabiting the islands were present in Australia. This implies the possibility that the iguanas could have come to the islands from Australia instead of the Americas.
  Choice E is irrelevant because the argument is focused on the iguana species and their origin.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the iguanas must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  We need to weaken the argument.
  If the iguanas are found on the islands and not in the Americas, it would strengthen the argument.
  If genetic analysis indicates that the iguanas on the islands are not closely related to those found in the Americas, it would also weaken the argument.
  If we have documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses, it would strengthen the argument.
  If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, it would weaken the argument.
  If the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, it would weaken the argument.
  The option that weakens the argument the most is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that iguanas made their way from the Americas to the islands by rafting on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this theory.
  Choice B states that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas. This suggests that the iguanas on the islands may have evolved independently from those in the Americas.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands came from the Americas by rafting to the islands.
  To weaken this argument, we need to present evidence that suggests the iguanas did not come from the Americas.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B could actually strengthen the argument if the genetic differences are small.
  Choice C does not provide any evidence against the argument.
  Choice D actually supports the argument.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
The scientist's argument is that the species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, based on the fact that there are closely related species in the Americas and nowhere else. 
To weaken this argument, we need to show that there are other possible explanations or counterexamples that explain the presence of these species on the islands that do not involve rafting from the Americas.
Option A and B do not weaken the argument, as they do not address the issue of how the species arrived on the islands.
Option D is not helpful in weakening the argument because the fossils being found in Australia means that the species existed in that area at some point, but it does not address the origin of the species on the island.
Option E is out of context as it does not relate to the iguanas on the island.
Option C is the most likely answer that weakens the argument because if there are very few documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses, then it is less likely that the progenitors of the current iguana species rafted from the Americas.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The scientist's argument is that the species of iguana on the islands originated in the Americas and rafted across the Pacific Ocean.
To weaken the argument, we need information that contradicts this line of reasoning.
Choice A is irrelevant.
Choice B suggests that the iguanas on the islands may have evolved differently from their American counterparts, but does not contradict the argument.
Choice C suggests that iguana rafting is uncommon, but does not contradict the argument.
Choice D suggests that closely related iguanas were found in Australia, which contradicts the argument.
Choice E is irrelevant.
Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted from America.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that this is not the only possible explanation.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument about iguanas.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument, but rather supports the claim that the iguana species on the islands are different from those in the Americas.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D suggests that iguana species existed in Australia before the fragmentation of Gondwana, which weakens the argument that the only explanation for the presence of iguanas on the islands is that they rafted from the Americas.
  Choice E also weakens the argument by suggesting that there are other lineages of species that predate the fragmentation of Gondwana, which may have contributed to the presence of iguanas on the islands.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The scientist argues that the iguana progenitors rafted on floating debris from the Americas across the Pacific Ocean since the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  If a statement is true that weakens the idea of rafting as the explanation for the appearance of the iguanas in the islands, then the argument would be weakened.
  Choice A offers an alternative explanation of how a number of animal species arrived in the islands, which does not involve rafting.
  The fact that the iguanas differ in several respects and the fact that iguana rafting is not a common occurrence does not necessarily weaken the argument.
  Choice D offers support for the possibility of the iguanas arriving in the islands via land bridges.
  Choice E deals with the age of the species, which is not related to the mode of transport.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The editorialist argues that an increase in air traffic beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The argument is based on studies conducted 30 years ago.
  The editorialist assumes that the latest safety technology cannot make up for the increase in air traffic.
  Therefore, the flaw in the argument is that it confuses an absence of evidence with the existence of evidence against the claim.
  The answer is D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that safety will be reduced if the city council approves the increase in air traffic.
  The editorialist supports this argument by citing numerous studies conducted 30 years ago.
  The editorialist assumes that the latest safety technology cannot improve safety beyond the original design capacity of an airport.
  Therefore, a flaw in the editorialist's argument is that the argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The editorialist claims that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's design capacity will decrease safety.
  The claim is supported by studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  The council members argue that safety technology would compensate for the increased air traffic.
  The editorialist rejects this claim, but provides no evidence against it.
  Therefore, the flaw in the editorialist's argument is that it confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  The answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's design capacity would decrease safety based on studies conducted 30 years ago.
  However, council members argue that the latest safety technology would accompany the traffic increase.
  The editorialist's argument fails to consider the council members' claims.
  Therefore, the flaw in the editorialist's argument is that it doesn't consider an alternative possibility.
  Choice C describes the possibility of the council members being aware of the studies.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, even if the latest safety technology were purchased.
  The editorialist supports this argument by citing numerous studies conducted 30 years ago that show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity.
  The flaw in the editorialist's argument is that the studies were conducted 30 years ago and there is no evidence to suggest that the latest safety technology would not mitigate the risks associated with increased air traffic.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The council members who support the increase argue that safety would not be decreased because the latest safety technology would be purchased alongside the increase.
  The editorialist argues against this by stating that studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
  Therefore, the flaw in the editorialist's argument is that they rely on evidence from 30 years ago, which may not be relevant to the current situation.
  The answer is D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues against the city council's proposal to increase air traffic.
  The council members believe that the latest safety technology would mitigate the risks.
  The editorialist disagrees and cites studies conducted 30 years ago.
  The editorialist concludes the increase would decrease safety.
  The flaw in the argument seems to be that it assumes the studies conducted 30 years ago are still relevant today and that the latest safety technology will not be effective.
  Choice A, B, C, and E do not address this flaw.
  Choice D accurately describes the editorialist's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's design capacity will decrease safety.
  The argument is based on studies conducted 30 years ago, which found that safety was reduced at every airport that increased traffic beyond its design capacity, even with the latest safety technology.
  The argument doesn't consider other possible factors, such as the latest safety technology.
  Therefore, the flaw in the argument is that it fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing the air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The council members say that safety would not decrease as it would be accompanied by the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist claims that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where permitted traffic was increased beyond the original design capacity, even when the latest safety technology was used.
  Thus, the main flaw in the argument is that the evidence presented is outdated.
  Choice D best describes this flaw.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing the amount of air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The editorialist supports this argument by stating that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
  This argument focuses only on safety concerns and does not consider other benefits that may arise from increasing air traffic.
  This answer choice refers to a flaw in the argument that is not present in the editorialist's argument.
  The argument acknowledges that the latest safety technology may accompany the increase in air traffic.
  Therefore, this answer choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  The editorialist's argument does not mention whether the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  Therefore, this answer choice does not accurately describe a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  This answer choice accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument.
  The editorialist uses the absence of evidence to conclude that increasing air traffic would decrease safety.
  The editorialist fails to recognize that the absence of evidence does not constitute evidence.
  This answer choice refers to a flaw in the argument that is not present in the editorialist's argument.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychiatrist: Take any visceral emotion you care to consider. There are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion. So, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Anger is always expressible.
  B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
  C: Some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express.
  D: All emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  E: An emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The psychiatrist argues that there are always healthy situations to express one's anger.
  Therefore, if an assumption can be made that links the idea of the situations where it is healthy to express anger with the idea that anger is a visceral emotion, then the conclusion will follow logically.
  Choice A is too extreme, and it claims that anger is always expressible, which is not supported by the argument.
  Choice B is correct because it links the idea that anger is a visceral emotion with the idea that there are always healthy situations to express one's anger.
  Choice C is not relevant to the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice D is too extreme, and it claims that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral, which is not supported by the argument.
  Choice E is incorrect because it reverses the relationship between the two concepts presented in the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to express one's anger.
  The psychiatrist states that for any visceral emotion, there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express it.
  The argument assumes that anger is a visceral emotion.
  If anger is not visceral, then the psychiatrist's statement would not support the conclusion that anger is healthy to express in all situations.
  The answer is B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The psychiatrist is saying that there is always a situation where it is healthy to express any visceral emotion.
  The psychiatrist then adds anger to the list of emotions that can be expressed healthily.
  For the conclusion to logically follow, the assumption must be that there are no situations in which it is unhealthy to express anger.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: An emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The psychiatrist argues that for any visceral emotion, there are situations in which it is healthy to express that emotion.
  The psychiatrist specifically mentions anger as an example, saying that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The conclusion of the argument is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  To follow logically, the argument must assume that anger is a visceral emotion.
  If anger is not a visceral emotion, then the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that any visceral emotion can be expressed in healthy situations.
  The argument specifically mentions anger as an example of a visceral emotion.
  The conclusion is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  This conclusion follows logically if it is assumed that anger is a visceral emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The psychiatrist argues that there are always situations where it is healthy to express any visceral emotion.
  Therefore, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express anger because anger is a visceral emotion.
  The conclusion follows logically if the assumption is that when an emotion is visceral, it is healthy to express it.
  Choice E implies that assumption.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The premise is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion.
  If we assume that anger is a visceral emotion, then it would follow that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The answer is B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The psychiatrist argues that since there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion, it follows that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The argument assumes that anger is a visceral emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion.
  Then, the argument concludes that it is always healthy to try to express one's anger since anger is a visceral emotion.
  The argument assumes that it is healthy to express all visceral emotions.
  Choice A is incorrect because it is too strong. The argument does not state that anger is always expressible.
  Choice B is correct because it is mentioned in the premise that anger is a visceral emotion.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it talks about some kinds of emotion being unhealthy to express, but the argument does not address unhealthy emotions.
  Choice D is incorrect because the argument only says that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral, but it does not say that the opposite is true.
  Choice E is also incorrect because the argument does not say that an emotion must be visceral to be healthy to express.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The psychiatrist argues that there is always a healthy situation to express any visceral emotion.
  The psychiatrist specifically uses anger as an example of a visceral emotion.
  The conclusion of the argument is that it is always healthy to try to express one's anger.
  This conclusion would only follow logically if we assume that the argument is true for all visceral emotions or that anger is always a visceral emotion.
  Choice A says that anger is always expressible, but this doesn't necessarily mean it is always healthy to express. 
  Choice B says that anger is a visceral emotion, which is true according to the argument, and supports the conclusion that it is always healthy to try to express one's anger.
  Choices C, D, and E are irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Anger is a visceral emotion.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads does not enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics show that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes.
  The argument, however, does not consider other factors that could potentially affect the likelihood of accidents, such as the quality of the bicycle lanes or the behavior of motorists.
  Therefore, the argument can be vulnerable to criticism on several grounds.
  Choice A is relevant to the argument, but it does not necessarily criticize the argument itself.
  Choice B is relevant, but the argument is not based on the number of bicyclists on the roads.
  Choice C is also relevant, but it is not the main focus of the argument.
  Choice D is not a criticism of the argument, but rather a misrepresentation of it.
  Choice E is the most relevant criticism, as it points out that the statistical evidence provided is not enough to support the conclusion made in the argument.

  The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur more frequently on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
  The argument does not address the possibility that injuries sustained in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are more or less severe than those sustained on roads without such lanes.
  The argument also does not address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
  The argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists will also enhance the safety of motorists.
  The argument does not conclude that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
  The argument does not use statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that there are factors other than the presence of bicycle lanes that could explain the higher incidence of collisions on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports its conclusion by stating that there are more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it:
    - overlooks the possibility that the bicycle lanes are not the cause of the collisions
    - fails to address the possibility that bicycle lanes may have other benefits
  Based on this, the best answer choice is B because it points out a possibility that the argument fails to address.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists, based on the statistic that roads with bicycle lanes have more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles than roads without bicycle lanes.
  However, the argument does not consider other factors that may have contributed to the statistic.
  Answer choice A criticizes the argument for overlooking the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes, which weakens the argument's conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports the claim by citing statistics that reveal more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if it doesn't address other possibilities that could affect the safety of bicyclists.
  Choice A and Choice E are irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  Choice C is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice D is a possible criticism that the argument overlooks the possibility that only some roads that currently have bicycle lanes are safe, but it is not the most vulnerable criticism.
  Therefore, the most vulnerable criticism is that the argument overlooks the possibility that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads may still enhance the safety of bicyclists in other ways.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the given statistics that show more collisions occur on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
  Choice A is outside the scope of the argument as it talks about the severity of injuries of bicyclists in accidents and not about the effectiveness of bicycle lanes.
  Choice B is also outside the scope of the argument as the number of bicyclists is not discussed.
  Choice C is a possible criticism as the argument assumes that the safety of motorists and bicyclists is directly correlated without any evidence to support this.
  Choice D is irrelevant as it talks about the safety of only some roads.
  Choice E is also outside the scope of the argument as it talks about the use of statistical evidence rather than the effectiveness of bicycle lanes.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
The argument is that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists, citing statistics that reveal more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. 
A: This is not relevant to the argument made in the passage.
B: If this were true, it would support the argument made in the passage and not criticize it.
C: This is not related to the argument made in the passage.
D: This is not the case made in the passage, which is stating that adding bicycle lanes is not enhancing the safety of bicyclists.
E: This is the best answer, as the argument is using statistical evidence that does not support the conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
The answer is E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
The argument states that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
The argument concludes that adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
The argument could be criticized on different grounds.
Option A presents an alternative possibility that the argument did not address.
Option B is not relevant to the argument.
Option C is not related to the argument.
Option D is not correct because the argument is not based on the premise that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
Option E is not correct because the argument is based on statistical evidence.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes will not enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics reveal that more collisions happen on roads with designated bicycle lanes.
  The argument does not account for the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes. This is a weakness in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that adding designated bicycle lanes to roads will not enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument is based on the fact that statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The conclusion is vulnerable to criticism since it may overlook other possibilities that may contribute to the higher number of collisions on roads with bicycle lanes.
  Choice A and E are not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B may be plausible, but it is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C is a plausible criticism, but it is not directly related to the argument.
  Choice D is relevant since it raises the possibility that the data may be incomplete, and more roads with bike lanes may be safer.
  Therefore, the answer is D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: While it is true that bees' vision is well suited to the task of identifying flowers by their colors, it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the statement above?
Choices:
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The statement suggests that flowers evolved to suit the colors that bees see and not the other way around.
  To support this, we need an answer choice that suggests flowers evolved to suit bees' vision, not that bees evolved to suit flower colors.
  Answer choice B suggests that some flowers rely on insects other than bees, which means that those flowers evolved to suit a different type of insect vision.
  This supports the idea that flower evolution was not solely dependent on bees and their color perception.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument is that flowers likely developed in response to bees' vision, not the other way around.
  Therefore, a choice that supports this idea would show that flower color might be important for reasons other than for bees to identify them by their color.
  Choice A says that some insects with similar vision to bees don't rely on color perception, which doesn't help us.
  Choice B talks about other insects but does not relate to bees' vision and flower color interaction.
  Choice C talks about the number of species but doesn't relate to the argument at hand.
  Choice D talks about nonflowering plants but doesn't relate to the argument at hand.
  Choice E says that bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, which supports the argument that flowers developed in response to bees' needs.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than the other way around. 
We are looking for an option that supports this statement. 
Option A just says that some insects don't need to perceive an object's color to identify it. 
Option B is talking about some flowers relying on insects other than bees. 
Option C is irrelevant. It talks about the number of different species of flowers and bees. 
Option D suggests that many nonflowering plants rely on bees. 
Option E just states that present-day bees rely on flowers for their food. 
The only option that supports the statement is Option A. If there are insects whose vision is similar to that of bees but who don't depend on perceiving an object's color, it suggests that flowers didn't develop color as a means of attracting bees to aid in their reproduction. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to bees' vision and not the other way around.
  To support this statement, we need to find an option that shows that flowers were developed in response to bees.
  Option A suggests that there are many insects that have vision similar to bees but do not depend on perceiving color. This option does not support the statement.
  Option B talks about some flowers that rely on insects other than bees. This option does not add any additional information in favor of or against the statement.
  Option C suggests that the number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This option does not support the given statement.
  Option D suggests that many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This option is irrelevant to the given statement.
  Option E suggests present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This option does not support the given statement.
  Thus, none of the options support the given statement. The answer is 'None of the above'.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to bees' vision rather than the other way around.
  The correct answer should support this claim.
  If insects similar to bees do not rely on perceiving an object's color, the statement can be supported.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the statement.
  Choice C is irrelevant and incorrect because there are more species of bees than the number of species of flowers.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the statement.
  If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, it does not necessarily support the statement.
  The best answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is saying that flowers probably developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  We need to find a statement that supports this claim.
  If there are insects that have a similar vision to bees but don't depend on perceiving object color, it suggests that flowers didn't evolve based just on the bees' vision.
  Therefore, A is not the correct answer.
  The argument is not about whether other insects also pollinate flowers or not, so B is irrelevant.
  The number of different species of flowers being more than the number of different species of bees doesn't help us determine anything about whether flowers evolved in response to bees, so C is not relevant.
  Nonflowering plants relying on bees doesn't help us determine anything about whether flowers evolved in response to bees, so D is not relevant.
  If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, this might suggest that over time flowers have evolved to be more attractive to bees, supporting the argument that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  Therefore, E is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The statement argues that it is likely that the colors of flowers evolved in response to the type of vision bees have, rather than bees' vision evolving in response to flower color.
  To strengthen this argument, we need an answer choice that supports the idea that flowers evolved to attract bees specifically, rather than bees evolving to better see flower colors.
  Answer choice E doesn't work because it only supports the fact that bees rely on flowers, which doesn't help us choose between the two possibilities.
  Answer choice A doesn't work because it tells us that other insects don't depend on color, but doesn't help us make a stronger argument for the relationship between flowers and bees.
  Answer choice C doesn't work because it tells us about the number of different species of flowers and bees, which doesn't really help us evaluate the relationship between flowers and bees.
  Answer choice D doesn't work because it's not clear how this statement connects to the relationship between flower colors and bee vision.
  Answer choice B is the most likely answer because it tells us that some flowers rely on insects other than bees, which implies that some flowers evolved to attract insects other than bees. This supports the idea that flowers evolved in response to specific insect pollinators, rather than those insects evolving to fit the flowers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  Which of the following statements would support this idea?
  Option A is irrelevant to the statement.
  Option B may show that other insects are involved, but it doesn't address the relationship between bees and flowers.
  Option C may be true, but it doesn't address the relationship between bees and flowers.
  Option D doesn't address the development of either bees or flowers.
  Option E doesn't provide any information about the development of bees or flowers.
  Therefore, none of the given choices support the statement above.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers evolved to be better suited to bees' vision.
  To support this, we need a statement that suggests that the flowers came first.
  Choice B, which suggests that other insects pollinate some flowers, weakens the statement.
  Choices A, C, and D don't provide any relevant information.
  Choice E is irrelevant.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The statement above suggests that flower color and form evolved as adaptations to the visual abilities of bees.
  Thus, if it can be shown that flowers did evolve in response to bees' visual abilities, that would support the statement.
  Choice B, which points out that some flowers rely on insects other than bees, weakens the argument that flowers evolved in response to bees.
  Choice C, which suggests that there are more species of flowers than bees, may be true, but it does not necessarily support the statement above.
  Choice D refers to nonflowering plants, which is irrelevant to the statement above.
  Choice E seems to support the idea that bees rely on flowers, but it does not address the question of whether flower color evolved in response to bees.
  Therefore, the best answer is A, which suggests that bees' color vision is not a common adaptation among insects, making it less likely that flower color evolved in response to it.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that using a blender to whip cream results in a thick, velvety substance. 
  It also states that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  Therefore, the statement "Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream" must be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively.
  The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  Therefore, A must be true: cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the result of attempting to whip cream in a blender.
  It states that a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively.
  The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  Therefore, answer choices A, B, and C are incorrect.
  The passage mentions that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat.
  Therefore, answer choice D could be true.
  However, the passage does not give enough information to say that the special attachment can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  Therefore, answer choice D is also incorrect.
  The passage does not provide any information about the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.
  Therefore, answer choice E is irrelevant.
  The only statement that is supported by the passage is that cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage states that using a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively.
  However, using a special whipping-cream attachment can help somewhat, but cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  Therefore, the answer is likely to be B or D.
  Statement A is true only in the context of the passage; it may not be true in general.
  Statement C is not supported by the passage because it says "always produces" which is too strong.
  Statement E is not relevant to the information given in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively.
  Although whipping cream in a blender can produce a thick, velvety substance, it is not the same as fluffy whipped cream.
  The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat but cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  Based on this, we can conclude that answer A is true. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The primary reason why a blender cannot whip cream effectively is due to the lack of air intake due to the container.
  Using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat but cannot fully compensate for poor air intake.
  Therefore, option A seems to be a correct and necessary conclusion based on the information given.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument states that a healthier diet based on fish protein should not be recommended because it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  The argument implies that there is a trade-off between health benefits and environmental concerns.
  Choice C discusses a trade-off between individual and collective actions.
  This is similar to the argument above where the trade-off is between individual health and environmental concerns.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that a diet with fish protein is healthier than one with red meat, but adopting this diet for everyone will cause marine species to become extinct.
  So, the universal adoption of this diet should not be recommended.
  Option A talks about a vitamin E supplement that reduces the risk of heart attack but is not conclusively safe for all people, so recommending it for everyone should not be done.
  Option B states that governments can tax tobacco heavily and spend the revenue on education but if taxes are high, people may smoke less and education may not get enough funding. So, other sources of revenue might have to be used, similar to how adopting a fish-protein diet will cause harm and makes it impossible.
  Option C advocates for limiting purchases to what is needed and saving or investing the rest of the income, which is better for an individual, but if everyone does this, it will cause a severe recession in the economy, making it difficult for most people to save and invest. This is similar to how adopting a fish protein diet will cause harm on a larger scale.
  Option D talks about how legislators spending less time campaigning will help them do their jobs better, but they may not get re-elected due to not campaigning enough, which is not related to the above argument.
  Option E talks about how restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve species but causes a decrease in the proliferation of species that thrive in developed areas. This is not analogous to the argument because it talks about the adverse effect of preserving species, whereas the argument talks about the adverse effect of a healthy diet.
Therefore, option B is the best answer as it is structurally and logically analogous to the reasoning in the argument above.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument states that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one on red meat. 
  But universal adoption of the fish-based diet would cause most of the marine species on which it is based to become extinct, making it impossible.
  Therefore, the universal adoption of the fish-based diet should not be recommended.
  The reasoning is that a certain approach would be ideal, but the universal adoption of that approach would result in negative consequences that make it impossible to pursue.
  Let's look at the choices.
  A talks about the potential negative consequences of recommending vitamin E supplements.
  B talks about how high taxes on tobacco could lead to reduced funding for education.
  C talks about the negative consequences of everyone adopting a certain spending pattern.
  D talks about how campaigning is necessary for legislators to get reelected.
  E talks about the negative consequences of designating wilderness areas.
  The reasoning in choice C most closely resembles that in the argument above.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument presents a dilemma where adopting a healthier diet would cause the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
  Option C presents a similar dilemma where recommending that everyone limit purchases might cause a severe recession.
  Therefore, the answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that adopting a healthy diet that relies heavily on fish protein would result in extinction of marine species that the diet is based on.
  The extinction of those marine species would make it impossible to maintain the healthy diet.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend adopting this healthy diet universally.
  The reasoning in option C is closest to this argument because it states that if everyone limited their purchases and saved the remaining income, it would be better for each consumer, but this could cause a severe recession. 
  Similarly, the argument is suggesting that something that is individually good (a healthy diet) could result in a negative collective outcome (extinction of marine species).
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument states that a diet, while much healthier, should not be universally adopted because it would cause the extinction of marine species.
  Choice A talks about the potential risks of vitamin E supplements and concludes that they should not be recommended universally.
  Choice B talks about how heavy tobacco taxes can result in reduced funding for education, which may require other sources of revenue.
  Choice C talks about how a spending pattern may be good for individuals but not good for the economy as a whole.
  Choice D talks about how legislators spend more time campaigning because they need to get reelected.
  Choice E talks about how restricting land development in wilderness areas can help preserve species in those areas, but it can also reduce the proliferation of species that thrive in developed areas.
  The argument that most closely resembles the reasoning in the original argument is Choice E. Both arguments present a situation where a course of action, while beneficial to one thing, can be detrimental to something else. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that a healthy diet based on fish protein would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible.
  Similarly, if everyone adopted the pattern of limiting purchases to what they need and saving or investing the rest, the economy would go into a severe recession, making saving and investing impossible for most people.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the argument is similar to that in choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument states that a healthier diet based on fish protein should not be adopted universally because it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, the reasoning behind the argument involves a trade-off between health and environmental concerns.
  Choice A argues for not recommending vitamin E supplements because it has not been established that it's safe for all people. It involves a trade-off between the benefits of vitamin E and the potential health risks.
  Choice B discusses the potential downside of heavily taxing tobacco, which is that people might smoke less, and funding for education might decrease. It involves a trade-off between funding for education and reduced tobacco consumption.
  Choice D discusses the trade-off between campaigning and doing the job for which legislators were elected.
  Choice E discusses the trade-off between preserving wilderness areas and reducing the proliferation of certain species.
  Choice C most closely resembles the argument above because it discusses the trade-off between individual spending choices and their impact on the economy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
The author of the argument is saying that a diet high in fish protein is healthy, but it would lead to the extinction of marine species if everyone adopted it. Hence, it should not be recommended for universal adoption.
Option A argues that although taking vitamin E supplements might be beneficial, their safety has not been established, and hence we should not recommend them universally.
Option B argues that if taxes on tobacco become too high, people might smoke less, and as a result, the revenue generated for education might reduce.
Option C argues that if everyone limits purchases to what they need, it would throw the economy into a severe recession, making saving and investing impossible for most people, and hence we should not recommend this spending pattern for everyone.
Option D argues that legislators spend too much time campaigning, but they have to do so to get reelected.
Option E argues that restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve many species, but it also reduces the proliferation of some species that flourish in developed areas, and hence it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
The argument that most closely resembles the reasoning in the argument above is Option E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument states that a diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. However, universal adoption of this diet is not recommended because most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible.
  Choice B talks about governments taxing tobacco heavily and spending this tax revenue on education. If the taxes become too high and people smoke less, then the funding generated for education might reduce, so such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  The reasoning in choice B is similar to that in the argument above.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filters can be distracting, just like windows or decorations.
  Answer choice D is also about a potential misconception, that engaging characters guarantee a book's success. However, this does not mean that engaging characters do not contribute to a book's success.
  Answer choice E argues that profit is not a good measure of a movie's success. However, it does not make a comparison to another potentially distracting factor.
  Answer choice A argues that moderation is not always a good thing, as people have different reactions to substances. However, this does not make a comparison to another potentially distracting factor.
  Answer choice C argues that because Acme needs a large work force, it will have to hire 1,000 new employees. This has no relation to the argument about website filters.
  The argument that is most similar in reasoning to the employee's argument is B. It argues that just because a substance causes cancer in laboratory animals in high doses, it should not necessarily be banned altogether. This is similar to the employee's argument that website filters can be distracting, but just because they are distracting does not mean they should be installed. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
The employee is arguing that the company's reasoning for blocking non-work-related websites is flawed because the same reasoning could be used to justify blocking other distractions, such as having windows or decorations.
The argument in choice D is similar in that it argues against a flawed reasoning by pointing out that other factors can also affect the outcome (in this case, the success of a novel or story).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software blocks non-work-related websites, but offices with windows or are nicely decorated can also be distracting. Therefore, filtering websites does not guarantee that employees will do their best work.
  Option D argues that aspiring writers are told engaging characters are necessary for a successful story but having engaging characters does not guarantee the manuscript will be accepted by publishers and agents.
  Both arguments point out that having one specific requirement does not guarantee success in the end result.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The employee is arguing that website filtering software is not necessarily the cause of poor work performance and that other factors such as office environment can also be distracting. 
  Answer choice D argues that having engaging characters in a novel does not guarantee success, as other elements are also important.
  This answer choice is similar to the employee's argument in that it acknowledges the importance of other factors and not just one.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not the only thing that distracts employees from doing their best work.
  B argues that a call to ban an electronic device for causing cancer in laboratory animals is an overreaction, as many chemicals probably cause cancer.
  D argues that creating engaging characters is not enough to guarantee success in the novel business. 
  Therefore, the argument that is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: The employee is arguing that the company's claim about website blocking being necessary to prevent distraction from non-work websites is not valid because there are other things in the workplace that are also distracting. We have to find an argument that uses a similar reasoning pattern.
  Option D talks about how aspiring writers are told that engaging characters will guarantee sales of their novels and stories. The author then goes on to argue that publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements, suggesting that the advice about engaging characters is not always valid. This is similar to the employee's argument because it shows that one claim being made is not always valid by pointing out exceptions.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
Response 6:
Thought: 
The employee argues that website filtering software blocks websites while ignoring other office distractions such as decorated offices. 
Choice D makes a similar argument which is that publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites is not necessary to improve productivity.
  The argument implies that other elements besides the filtering software can be distracting.
  Choice D argues that the presence of engaging characters does not guarantee a book will sell, just as the presence of non-distracting elements does not guarantee productivity.
  Therefore, choice D is the most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
The employee argues that website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites can be distracting, just like offices that have windows or are nicely decorated.
Choice D argues that having engaging characters does not guarantee the success of a novel or story.
Both arguments suggest that a particular factor (website filtering software or engaging characters) does not lead to a particular outcome (productive work or a successful book).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to prevent distractions because other distractions are not being regulated.
Choice D compares two things that are not necessarily related (engaging characters and selling a story).
Choice E compares two methods of measuring success.
Choice A references how people may react differently to substances.
Choice C references hiring employees to replace retiring employees.
Choice B compares the banning of one electronic device to the banning of all chemicals that can cause cancer.
Choice B seems to be the most similar in reasoning to the employee's argument. Both arguments argue that one thing should not be regulated because there are other things that are not regulated but may cause similar problems.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The study showed that the level of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  The question asks which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study.
  Option A does not explain the finding that the level of nicotine in the blood of smokers is identical.
  Option B does not explain the finding that the level of nicotine in the blood of smokers is identical.
  Option D provides irrelevant information about the level of tar in cigarettes.

  We need to find the answer that best explains this finding.
  Option A doesn't explain why the level of nicotine is identical at the end of the day.
  Option B is irrelevant.
  Option C is a plausible explanation as the quantity of nicotine that is absorbed in the blood depends on the mode of delivery.
  Option D does not relate to the nicotine levels in the blood.
  Option E doesn't explain the finding either.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.

Response 3:
Thought: 
  The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  We need to explain why the level of nicotine in the blood is identical regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.
  If low-nicotine cigarettes resulted in a lower nicotine level in the blood, this would explain the result.
  Answer choice C suggests that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities, which would explain why the level of nicotine in the blood is identical regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.

  Option A doesn't help explain why the levels of nicotine in the blood are the same.
  Option B suggests that smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes. However, it doesn't explain why the levels of nicotine in the blood are the same.
  Option C suggests that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of the smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities. This might explain why the levels of nicotine in the blood are the same, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes smoked. 
  Option D talks about the level of tar in cigarettes, which is irrelevant to the study's findings about the levels of nicotine.
  Option E doesn't explain why the levels of nicotine in the blood are the same.
  Therefore, option C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The study has shown that the nicotine level in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day is same at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine.
  We need to find a choice that explains this finding.
  Option A does not explain why the nicotine levels are the same.
  Option B is irrelevant as it does not explain the finding of the study.
  Option D is also irrelevant as it talks about tar in cigarettes.
  Option E is also irrelevant as it talks about the decrease in nicotine levels in the blood after discontinuing smoking.
  Option C explains that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities, which can explain why the nicotine levels are the same in smokers who smoke cigarettes with different nicotine levels.

  This means that the amount of nicotine absorbed by the blood is independent of the nicotine level in cigarettes.
  Option A is close but only states the maximum amount of nicotine that blood can absorb.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the study as it does not explain the finding.
  Option D is also irrelevant as the study focuses on nicotine levels, not tar levels.
  Option E might be partially relevant but it only talks about the decrease of nicotine level, not how it is absorbed.
  Option C is the most relevant to the finding as it explains that the amount of nicotine absorbed in the blood is dependent on the quantity delivered and not on the level of nicotine.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If grain prices double then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that if grain prices double then:
  1. The average price of a loaf of bread will rise 10 to 15 percent.
  2. The price of grain-fed beef will almost double.
  Thus, we need to identify an option that contributes to the explanation of why these two phenomena happen differently.
  Option B, which states that the wholesale price of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price of bread, doesn't explain why bread and beef react differently to the increase in grain prices.
  Option A talks about labor costs but it doesn't seem to relate to the phenomena.
  Option C discusses cost but doesn't explain the difference in behavior between bread and beef.
  Option D is interesting and explains why the price of grain-fed beef goes up, but it doesn't explain why the price of bread doesn't almost double.
  Option E doesn't seem relevant to the given phenomenon.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain. This option explains why the price of grain-fed beef would almost double.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described above is that when the grain prices double:
    - the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent
    - the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  This implies that there is a more significant increase in the price of beef than bread because of the increase in grain prices.
  Therefore, the option that explains why the price of beef is more affected by the increase in grain prices is the answer.
  Option B is not relevant because it talks about the comparison of wholesale prices of beef and bread.
  Option A is not relevant.
  Option C talks about the cost of producing beef and bread but not related to the prices.
  Option D is not relevant because it talks about the production of beef from grass-fed cattle.
  Option E is also not relevant because it talks about the purchasing process of retail grocery outlets.
  None of the options seem to explain the phenomenon described above.
  But if we have to choose the most relevant one, then it would be Option C because it talks about the cost of producing beef and bread.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described above is that grain prices doubling would cause the average price of a loaf of bread to rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef would come close to doubling.
  We need to find the answer that contributes to an explanation of this phenomenon.
  Some of the answer choices provide irrelevant information, so we need to eliminate them.
  Option B talks about the wholesale price per pound of beef and bread, which is irrelevant.
  Option C provides information on the cost of producing bread and beef, but it does not explain the phenomenon.
  Option A and E are also irrelevant.
  Option D states that an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, which suggests that the price of beef is highly dependent on the price of grain.
  Therefore, the answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The phenomenon described is that grain prices doubling will have different effects on the prices of bread and beef.
  The price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  The price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  The question asks for an explanation of why this phenomenon occurs.
  The best explanation is one that relates to the cost of producing each product.
  Option C provides such an explanation, stating that the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described above is that if grain prices double, the price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 to 15 percent while the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  The question is asking which option explains the phenomenon the most.
  Option B is not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Option A is irrelevant to the phenomenon.
  Option E is irrelevant to the phenomenon.
  Option C is trying to explain the cost structures for producing bread and beef but is not relevant to explaining the phenomenon.
  Option D states that an insignificantly small proportion of beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, which means that most of the beef sold is produced from grain-fed cattle.
  Option D is relevant to explaining the phenomenon because most of the beef sold is produced from grain-fed cattle. Since the cost of grain has doubled, the cost of producing beef has also increased, which leads to an increase in the price of beef.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The phenomenon described is that if grain prices double, then the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling, whereas the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  The question asks for the option that best explains the phenomenon.
  Option B, which states that the wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread, does not appear to be relevant or contribute to the explanation of the phenomenon described.
  Option A, which states that farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef, does not appear to be relevant or contribute to the explanation of the phenomenon described.
  Option E, which states that the vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations, does not appear to be relevant or contribute to the explanation of the phenomenon described. 
  Option C, which states that the labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef, suggests that the cost of grain represents a smaller proportion of the cost of producing bread than the cost of feeding cattle represents in the cost of producing beef. Thus, when grain prices double, the increase in the cost of producing bread is less than the increase in the cost of producing beef. This could explain why the price of bread only rises 10-15% while the price of beef comes close to doubling.
  Option D, which states that only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, does not appear to be relevant or contribute to the explanation of the phenomenon described.
  Therefore, the best option that explains the phenomenon described is C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that when grain prices double, the price of bread rises 10-15% and the price of grain-fed beef almost doubles.
  The question asks which of the following options most contributes to an explanation of this phenomenon.
  Answer choice B provides information on the wholesale price difference between bread and beef but does not explain why beef prices double while bread prices rise only slightly.
  Answer choice C provides cost information on bread and beef, but it does not explain why beef prices double while bread prices rise only slightly.
  Answer choice D gives information about the proportion of grain-fed beef sold, but it does not explain why beef prices double while bread prices rise only slightly.
  Answer choice E is irrelevant and does not help explain the phenomenon.
  Answer choice A, if true, would suggest that farmers might be willing to pay more for grain to feed their cattle, which in turn would cause the price of grain-fed beef to increase.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  According to the context:
  - If grain prices double, the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  - Whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  To explain the phenomenon above, we need to identify why the price of beef rises more significantly than bread.
  If option A is true, it may explain why the cost of producing and selling beef may increase and lead to a rise in beef prices.
  Option B is not relevant to the issue we are trying to explain.
  If option C is true, it may explain why bread's price has a limited increase even if the cost of the grain, which is an essential ingredient in bread, has doubled.
  Option D is not relevant to the issue we are trying to explain.
  If option E is true, it may explain why the price of beef may increase more significantly than the price of bread.
  Option E seems to be a better choice than option A and C.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that if grain prices double, then the price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will almost double.
  Given the context, we need to find the option that would best explain the phenomenon.
  Option A is about reducing labor costs of beef production and does not explain the difference in the price increase between bread and beef.
  Option B is about the wholesale prices of bread and beef, but it does not explain why the prices increase differently.
  Option C explains that most of the cost of producing bread is from labor and marketing, while the cost of producing beef is from feeding cattle, which is consistent with the phenomenon described.
  Option D is about the proportion of beef fed on grass versus grain, which does not explain the difference in the price increase between bread and beef.
  Option E is about where retail outlets purchase their bread and meat, but it does not explain why the prices increase differently.
  Therefore, the answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The stimulus states that when grain prices double, the price of grain-fed beef comes close to doubling, while the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Thus, there must be a difference in the cost of production between bread and beef that can explain the price difference.
  Option C states that the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef and the labor and marketing costs of bread represent most of its cost.
  This difference can explain why beef prices are more sensitive to grain prices doubling than bread prices.
  Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information because they are as accurate as mechanical monitoring devices.
  We need to find an option that strengthens the argument.
  Option B provides additional evidence that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales, supporting the researcher's argument.
  Option A, C, D, and E, are out of scope.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The researcher argues that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that lichens offer unique advantages over the best equipment available.
  Option B provides evidence that copper particles are present in air pollution in several places, thus increasing the relevance of the researcher's findings.
  Other choices are either unrelated or do not provide additional support to the researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The researcher proposes that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to support the claim that lichens are effective in monitoring air pollution.
  Option B is already mentioned in the passage and is not new information.
  Options A, C, and D are irrelevant to the researcher's argument.
  Option E is helpful information, but it does not specifically strengthen the argument that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices.
  Therefore, none of the options strongly strengthen the researcher's argument.
  However, option E is the most relevant information to the researcher's argument as it supports that lichens can absorb pollutants other than copper.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The researcher argues that lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information, based on the results of the experiment.
  Thus, the correct answer choice should strengthen the researcher's argument.
  Answer choice B provides evidence that copper is a common component of air pollution in several locales.
  This supports the researcher's conclusion that lichens can be used as a substitute for expensive mechanical monitoring devices.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument of the researcher is that lichens are as accurate as the best equipment available to monitor air pollution, and they are a cheaper alternative.
  To strengthen the argument, we need an answer that supports the accuracy of lichens and their ability to monitor air pollution.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it talks about the installation of mechanical monitoring devices and has nothing to do with lichens.
  Choice B is relevant because it states that copper particles are present in air pollution and can be monitored by lichens.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it talks about the minimal air pollution and has nothing to do with lichens' ability to monitor air pollution.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it talks about growing lichens in laboratories and has nothing to do with their ability to monitor air pollution.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it talks about all other significant air pollutants, and we are only concerned with copper pollution.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales. This choice reinforces the fact that copper pollutants are present in the air, which confirms the ability of lichens to monitor air pollution. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  The researcher supports this argument by stating that the lichens' copper concentration readings are as accurate as mechanical monitoring devices' readings.
  Therefore, the answer choice that most strengthens the researcher's argument is the one that establishes that the lichens' accuracy is not limited to copper but extends to other air pollutants.
  Answer choice B is irrelevant to the researcher's argument.
  Answer choices A and D are irrelevant as they do not relate to the accuracy of the lichens' readings.
  Answer choice C weakens the researcher's argument as it suggests that lichens are not reliable indicators of air pollution.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The researcher argues that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without any loss of information.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to provide evidence that supports the researcher's argument.
  Option B mentions that "Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales".
  This strengthens the argument as the researcher used lichens to monitor airborne copper pollution, which is a type of air pollution.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without a loss of information.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the use of lichens to monitor air pollution is reliable and efficient.
  Option E addresses the reliability aspect of the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can effectively replace expensive air pollution monitoring devices.
  The experiment showed that the copper concentration determined from lichens is as accurate as the best equipment available. 
  Therefore, the answer choice that most strengthens the argument should provide additional evidence that lichens are a reliable and cost-effective alternative to mechanical monitoring devices.
  Answer choice B strengthens the argument by stating that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales, which suggests that the experiment's results are applicable beyond the specific site. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The researcher found that lichens are as accurate as the best equipment available in monitoring copper pollution.
  To strengthen the researcher's argument, we need to provide evidence that lichens can also accurately monitor other pollutants besides copper.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion
  D: appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute
  E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The journalist is making an argument that withholding information in interviews is not the same as lying because it does not actively encourage a false belief.
  The journalist does this by pointing out the distinction between actively encouraging a false belief and failing to prevent one.
  The argument is not based on a counterexample, nor is it concerned with defining a concept or clarifying a moral principle.
  The journalist is not trying to refute an argument, but is rather defending a distinction.
  Therefore, the journalist is pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn.

  The answer is E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E") 

The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle (that lying is unethical) by comparing the case of withholding relevant information in interviews to the case of lying. The journalist argues that there is a distinction between actively encouraging a false belief (which is unethical) and failing to prevent a false belief (which may not be unethical). This suggests that the moral principle being defended applies to the case of lying but not to the case of withholding relevant information. Therefore, the correct answer is E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The journalist presents an argument on the ethicality of journalists withholding information in interviews.
  The journalist argues that withholding information is not the same as lying, as the former does not encourage false beliefs.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in a significant percentage of people.
  The argument also compares H pylori with Mycobacter tuberculosis- another bacterium that doesn't harm many who harbor it- but no one considers it a commensal.
  To undermine this argument's reasoning, we need to find evidence that counters the logic behind the argument.
  If we find evidence that supports the argument, then the answer isn't correct.
  Only answer choice C addresses the issue by providing evidence that M tuberculosis doesn't benefit the people who harbor it.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that since only 10% of people with H pylori get sick from it, it cannot be considered a commensal.
  It compares this to M tuberculosis which also only makes 10% of people sick, but still cannot be considered a commensal.
  The correct answer choice will present a reason why comparing the two bacteria is not valid.
  Choice A does not address the validity of the comparison.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C presents a reason why M tuberculosis should not be considered a commensal but does not address the validity of the comparison.
  Choice D is irrelevant because the argument does not compare the number of people who harbor each bacteria.
  Choice E presents a reason why the comparison is not valid - H pylori is much more common than M tuberculosis.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that just because H pylori allegedly strengthens the immune response and only a small percentage of people develop stomach ulcers, it should not be considered a commensal.
  The comparison with M tuberculosis is made to show that not all bacteria that have low rates of causing harm can be considered commensals.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find an answer that shows why H pylori should be considered a commensal despite the low rates of stomach ulcers.
  Answer choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice B is also irrelevant, as the argument does not discuss the duration of illnesses caused by either bacterium.
  Answer choice C, if true, would strengthen the argument's reasoning, as it shows that M tuberculosis does not benefit its host.
  Answer choice D and E are also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument discusses the classification of H pylori as a commensal.
  The counterexample given is M tuberculosis which is not considered a commensal despite having a similar rate of causing sickness.
  The reasoning is that the potential for disease is not a sufficient criterion for determining commensal status.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to provide a counterexample where the potential for disease is not a sufficient criterion, but the bacterium is still considered a commensal.
  Option C provides a counterexample where M tuberculosis does not provide any benefit. Therefore, M tuberculosis could be considered a pathogen, not a commensal. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument presents an analogy between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  The analogy is undermined if there is a relevant difference between the two cases.
  Choice A is not relevant to the analogy.
  Choice B is not relevant to the analogy.
  Choice C suggests that M tuberculosis is not a commensal because it does not benefit the people who harbor it; this undermines the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D suggests that M tuberculosis is more common than H pylori; this is not relevant to the analogy.
  Choice E suggests that H pylori is more common than M tuberculosis; this is not relevant to the analogy.
  Therefore, the answer is C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that considering H pylori as a commensal bacterium is misguided.
  The argument supports this claim by showing that only a small percentage of people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it, yet no one calls it a commensal.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find an answer choice that shows that H pylori is more similar to a commensal than M tuberculosis is.
  Choice C shows that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from it, but the argument does not claim that H pylori benefits people.
  Choice D and E are not relevant to the argument.
  Choice A and B do not show that H pylori is more similar to a commensal than M tuberculosis is.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the bacterium H pylori is not a commensal despite strengthening the immune response and causing ulcers in less than 10% of those who harbor it. 
  The argument compares H pylori with M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal, even though only 10% of individuals who harbor the bacterium get sick from it.
  The correct answer choice will undermine the argument's reasoning by either making the comparison between the two bacteria invalid or by providing an alternative explanation for why H pylori is a commensal.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the comparison between the two bacteria.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because the duration of illness is not related to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C supports the argument by providing another example of a bacterium that is not a commensal.
  Choice D is irrelevant because the relative numbers of people harboring each bacterium does not relate to their commensal status.
  Choice E could be relevant if there are more people who derive benefits from H pylori than M tuberculosis.
  Therefore, the best answer choice is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the bacterium H pylori cannot be considered a commensal even though it benefits human beings because it also plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis and claims that since not all people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it, M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal.
  The reasoning is that since M tuberculosis does not provide any benefits to the people who harbor it, it cannot be a commensal.
  To undermine this reasoning, we need to show that the argument's comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed or that there is another reason why M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal.
  Only choice C tries to provide another reason why M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal.
  Therefore, the answer is C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
Action: Answer("C")

  The argument claims that H. pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some individuals, while commensals are bacteria that benefit their host without causing harm.
  The argument uses the example of M. tuberculosis, which can also be present in individuals without causing harm, but it is not considered a commensal.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that challenges the idea that the presence of H. pylori does not confer any benefits to the host.
  Option C suggests that people who harbor M. tuberculosis do not derive any benefits from its presence.
  This does not challenge the argument's reasoning, as it supports the idea that M. tuberculosis is not a commensal.
  Therefore, Option C does not undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Options A, B, D, and E do not address the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, they are not the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument is that just because only a small percentage of people who harbor H pylori get ulcers, it should not be considered a commensal since M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal even though only 10% of those who harbor it get sick from it.
  To undermine this argument, we need to show that there are other relevant differences between H pylori and M tuberculosis that make it reasonable to consider one a commensal and not the other.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B talks about the duration of the diseases and does not address whether one can be considered a commensal while the other cannot.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning. If people derive no benefit from the presence of M tuberculosis, this provides a relevant difference from H pylori.
  Choice D provides irrelevant information.
  Choice E also provides irrelevant information.
  Therefore, the answer is C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Principle: Any person or business knowingly aiding someone's infringement on a copyright is also guilty of copyright infringement. Application: Grandview Department Store, which features a self-service photo-printing kiosk, is guilty of copyright infringement since a customer using the kiosk infringed on a wedding photographer's copyright by printing photographs whose copyright is held by the photographer.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to justify the application of the principle?
Choices:
  A: The operator of a business has the same legal obligations to customers who use self-service facilities as it has to customers who use full-service facilities.
  B: The management of a business that is open to the public is obligated to report to the authorities any illegal activity that it witnesses on its property.
  C: The owner of a self-service printing kiosk should post a notice advising customers that copyrighted material should not be printed at the kiosk without the permission of the copyright holder.
  D: Owners of self-service facilities should monitor those facilities in order to ensure that they are not used for illegal or unethical purposes.
  E: A person or business providing a service that can be expected to be used to infringe on a copyright should be considered to knowingly aid any copyright infringer using the service. 15

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The evidence supporting the naturalists’ claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  To cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, we need to find a statement that weakens the evidence.
  B is not a concern because it explains that the release site was on the bear’s annual migration route.
  A is not a concern because the bear stopped and changed course several times, which is a common behavior when navigating.
  C is not a concern because it explains the route taken by the polar bear, which does not necessarily mean that the bear did not navigate its way.
  D is not a concern because it states that there are other animals that can find their way home from considerable distances but it does not contradict that polar bears can do the same.
  E is the most likely answer because it suggests that polar bears rely heavily on their sense of smell to navigate, which weakens the case for long-distance navigation by polar bears.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The naturalists cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We need to find an answer that casts the most doubt on the validity of this evidence.
  If the polar bear was released on its annual migration route or relied on its sense of smell, it would still support the naturalists' claim.
  If the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, it would cast doubt on the validity of the evidence because it suggests that the polar bear was not using navigation to find its way back home.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances and cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  The question asks which statement casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it is possible that the polar bear may have returned home using its memory of the migration route rather than by navigation.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The naturalists' claim is that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim is an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  The question asks for the choice that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Choice A suggests that the bear did not follow a direct path home, but this does not necessarily cast doubt on the claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  Choice B suggests that the bear was released in a location where it was already familiar, which would cast doubt on the claim that the bear used navigation skills to return home.
  Choice C describes the route the bear traveled, but this information alone does not cast doubt on the claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Choice E provides an alternate explanation for how the polar bear navigated home, which would cast doubt on the claim that the bear used navigation skills to return home.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  The validity of the evidence is being questioned.
  We need to find the option that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option B might actually support the naturalists' claim by stating that the release site was on the bear's annual migration route.
  Option D might be true, but it doesn't necessarily question the validity of the evidence.
  Option E provides information but does not really question the evidence.
  Options A and C seem more likely to cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  However, option A only mentions several stops, which may or may not be significant, while option C suggests that the polar bear did not actually navigate over considerable distances because its route consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered to support the claim is an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  We need to find an option that casts doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Option B suggests that the location where the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This suggests that the polar bear might have already been familiar with the location and could have used other senses to guide itself home.
  Therefore, option B casts doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The naturalists' evidence is based on the polar bear's ability to return to its home territory from a considerable distance.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear had to stop and change course several times.
  Option B suggests that the polar bear was on its migration route, which may imply that the bear was familiar with the area.
  Option C describes the environment that the polar bear navigated, which may or may not affect navigation.
  Option D compares the polar bear's navigational ability with other mammals and does not invalidate the naturalists' claim.
  Option E describes how the polar bear navigates, which is not related to the validity of the evidence.
  Option A or B suggest limitations to the validity of the evidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question is asking to identify the one option that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  The naturalists' claim is that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances, supporting it with an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  The option that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered would be the one that weakens the argument that supports the claim.
  Option A and C do not have any direct effect on the validity of the evidence.
  Option B and E provide further evidence that polar bears have a good sense of navigation. So, they do not cast any doubt on the validity of the evidence offered.
  Option D suggests that the behavior of finding the way home from considerable distances is not unique to polar bears. If this statement is true, it would imply that this behavior is not specific to polar bears and thus weaken the naturalists' claim.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence provided by the naturalists is of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  We need to find an option that weakens the naturalists' claim.
  Option A does not entirely weaken the naturalists' claim as it still shows that the polar bear navigated its way back to its home territory.
  Option B strengthens the naturalists' claim as the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  Option C does not entirely weaken the naturalists' claim as it only describes the route along which the polar bear traveled and does not contradict that it found its way back home.
  Option D does not entirely weaken the naturalists' claim as it only mentions that polar bears are not the only animals capable of navigating over considerable distances.
  Option E does not entirely weaken the naturalists' claim as it only describes an additional way in which polar bears navigate.
  Therefore, the best option that weakens the naturalists' claim is Option B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument says that some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence in support of this claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  We need to find an answer that makes this evidence invalid.
  If the released place were on the bear's annual migration route, the bear could have used its predetermined migration route to return home.
  So, B can be a possible answer.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
  The argument provides evidence for the above claim by stating that colon cancer rates are higher in Western countries where people eat less fther-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables.
  The argument also states that in Scandinavia, where the colon cancer rate is higher in a given area, the consumption of cereals, which are also high in fther, is lower.
  The argument concludes that the consumption of fther-rich foods is essential to prevent colon cancer.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if it overlooks an important factor that could affect the conclusion negatively.
  Among the choices, the most likely criticism against the argument is the possibility that some foods that contain fther also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer. 
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer while sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument does not address the possibility that the high-fiber diets in non-Western countries include other factors that prevent colon cancer.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that consuming fther-rich foods decreases the incidence of colon cancer.
  The argument also claims that regions with higher consumption of fther-rich foods have lower rates of colon cancer.
  The argument concludes that consuming sufficient fther prevents colon cancer.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks some possibilities that may weaken the conclusion.
  Option A does not address the argument presented. 
  Option B is incorrect because we are only considering colon cancer, not other types of cancer. 
  Option C may be a valid point, but it does not weaken the argument.
  Option D does not contradict the argument, so it is not a strong criticism.
  Option E may be a potential criticism because foods containing fther may also have other substances that prevent colon cancer.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
The argument states that there is a negative correlation between high-fther diets and colon cancer and that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer while sufficient consumption prevents it.
The argument does not cover the possibility that there might be other factors contributing to the correlation.
Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
Choice B is out of scope for the argument.
Choice C is also irrelevant.
Choice D is not relevant to the argument.
Choice E is a possibility since it suggests that other substances in fther-rich foods might be contributing to preventing colon cancer.
Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that a sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer.
  It supports its claim by citing the correlation between high-fiber diets and low colon cancer rates.
  The argument assumes that insufficient fiber consumption causes colon cancer.
  However, the argument does not take into account the possibility of other factors that may cause colon cancer.
  Therefore, we need to find an answer choice that highlights a possible alternative cause of colon cancer.
  Answer choice A is irrelevant to the argument made.
  Answer choice B provides evidence that supports the argument made.
  Answer choice C is irrelevant to the argument made.
  Answer choice D is a possible alternative explanation, but it does not necessarily contradict the argument.
  Answer choice E is a possible alternative explanation, which challenges the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that low consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and high consumption prevents it.
  The argument uses evidence from Western and non-Western countries to support the claim.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if it fails to consider other factors that may cause colon cancer or prevent it.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is relevant, but it does not necessarily weaken the argument.
  Choice E is most relevant because it suggests that other substances in foods containing fiber may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, not just fiber alone.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument provides evidence that low-fiber diets cause colon cancer and high-fiber diets prevent it.
  The argument does not address other factors that may contribute to colon cancer risk.
  Therefore, the argument may overlook such factors.
  The answer choice that identifies an alternative explanation for the observed correlation between low-fiber diets and colon cancer is the correct answer.
  Answer choice B is not an alternative explanation because it supports the argument's conclusion.
  Answer choice C is irrelevant because the argument does not claim that everyone can or should consume high amounts of fiber.
  Answer choice D is not relevant because the argument does not claim that all types of fiber have the same effect on colon cancer risk.
  Answer choice A is not relevant because the argument does not claim that fiber consumption is decreasing or increasing in any country.
  Answer choice E suggests that other substances in fiber-containing foods may prevent colon cancer, which would provide an alternative explanation for the observed correlation between low-fiber diets and colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  However, it does not take into account any other factors that may contribute to colon cancer risk.
  The answer choice that identifies such a factor would be the best criticism.
  Answer choices A and C have to do with the difficulty or ease of consuming fiber, but not with its impact on colon cancer.
  Answer choice B is tangential to the argument - the argument does not claim that high-fiber diets reduce the risk of many types of cancer.
  Answer choice D may be relevant, but the argument does not discuss different degrees of cancer-fighting properties.
  Answer choice E is the most directly relevant to the argument because it suggests that other substances in fiber-containing foods may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, rather than fiber itself. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument supports its claim by citing studies that demonstrate negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  The argument does not consider alternative explanations for the correlation.
  The question asks what the argument overlooks.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not challenge the argument's claim or reasoning.
  Choice B is irrelevant because it introduces a new claim that is not supported by the argument and does not challenge the argument's claim.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it does not challenge the argument's claim or reasoning.
  Choice D is plausible because it suggests that not all fiber is equal in preventing colon cancer; however, the argument still relies on the fact that high-fiber diets are associated with lower incidence of colon cancer.
  Choice E is the best answer because it suggests that other substances in fiber-rich foods might be responsible for preventing colon cancer, rather than fiber itself.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that a high-fiber diet prevents colon cancer, and a low-fiber diet causes colon cancer.
  The argument uses the incidence rate of colon cancer in western and non-western countries as evidence.
  The argument also uses the relationship between cereals and colon cancer rate in Scandinavia as evidence.
  The question asks us to identify a possibility that has been overlooked in the argument.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument, and it does not address the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
  Choice B could be a valid point, but it is not relevant to the argument. The argument is only concerned with the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is a plausible criticism because the argument does not distinguish between different types of fiber. If fruits and vegetables have a different type of fiber than cereals, then the argument would be less convincing.
  Choice E is a plausible criticism because the argument does not consider the possibility that other substances in fiber-rich foods, not just fiber itself, could be responsible for the reduction in colon cancer.
  Both choice D and E are possible criticisms, but choice E is a more general and inclusive criticism. Therefore, E is the best answer.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document
  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known
  E: takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information
Response 0:
Thought:
  The journalist received a document that lists hundreds of manufacturing companies that belong to a trade group.
  A representative confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  The journalist assumes that Bruch Industries is not a member of that trade group because it is not listed in the document.
  The journalist's reasoning is flawed because the document may not be comprehensive.
  The correct answer is B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
Action: Answer("B")

Thought:
  The journalist argues that because Bruch Industries is not listed in the document, it is not a member of the trade group.
  However, there may be other reasons why Bruch Industries is not listed in the document.
  For example, the document may only list some of the member companies.
  Therefore, the journalist's reasoning is flawed.
  The correct answer is B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The journalist received a document from a manufacturers' trade group that listed hundreds of manufacturing companies.
  A representative from the trade group confirmed that all the companies in the document belong to the trade group.
  The journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group because they are not listed in the document.
  However, there could be reasons why Bruch Industries is not listed, such as if they were accidentally left off or intentionally left off.
  Therefore, the journalist's reasoning is flawed and the correct answer is either A, B, D, or E.
  Choice C is not relevant to the journalist's argument.
  Among A, B, D, and E, the best answer is B because the journalist has not presented evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The journalist received a document from a trade group listing hundreds of manufacturing companies and confirmed that every company belongs to the trade group.
  Because Bruch Industries is not listed in the document, the journalist concludes that it is not a member of the trade group.
  The reasoning is flawed because not all members are necessarily listed in the document the journalist received.
  The correct answer should point out this flaw in the journalist's reasoning.
  Choice B does, in fact, point out this flaw by suggesting that the document may not have named every member of the trade group.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is not a member of the trade group.
  The argument assumes that the document names every member of the trade group.
  There may be reasons why Bruch Industries is not listed on the document that have nothing to do with its membership in the trade group.
  Therefore, the journalist's reasoning is flawed in that the journalist does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The journalist presents a document that lists hundreds of manufacturing companies that belong to the trade group.
  The trade group confirms that every company on the document is a member of the group.
  The journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group because it is not listed on the document.
  The journalist assumes that the list of companies on the document is complete and accurate.
  The journalist does not consider that there may be other reasons why Bruch Industries is not on the list.
  Therefore, the journalist's reasoning is flawed because he does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that since Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is not a member of the trade group.
  However, it is possible that there are other ways to become a member of the trade group, not just by being listed on the document.
  Therefore, the journalist's reasoning is flawed.
  The best choice is B because the journalist does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group because it is not listed in the document.
  However, the document may not include every member of the trade group.
  Therefore, the journalist's reasoning is flawed in that the journalist does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: The journalist's conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group is based on the premise that the document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies contains the names of every member of the trade group. The journalist does not consider the possibility that Bruch Industries may belong to the trade group but was simply not included on the document. Therefore, the journalist's reasoning is flawed, and the best answer is B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The journalist claims that since Bruch Industries is not on the document of the manufacturing companies that belong to the trade group, it is not a member of the trade group.
  The journalist assumes that the document includes every member of the trade group.
  There may be other reasons why Bruch Industries is not on the document.
  The journalist does not explore why Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group.

Topic: Law
Context: Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. One should exercise most days of the week, but one need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits. More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the statements above?
Choices:
  A: Having a strenuous workout most days of the week can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  B: Doing the equivalent of an hour of brisk walking two or three times a week generally produces dramatic improvements in cardiovascular health.
  C: It is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week.
  D: Aside from exercise, there is no way of improving one's cardiovascular health.
  E: To obtain a dramatic improvement in one's cardiovascular health, one must exercise strenuously at least occasionally.
Response 0:
Thought: 
 - Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
 - One should exercise most days of the week.
 - One should do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.
 - More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
 - The statement most strongly supported is the one that is best supported by the passage's evidence.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage says that modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  It recommends exercising most days of the week.
  Doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days is sufficient to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.
  The passage also suggests that more vigorous exercise is more effective, but not necessary.
  Option A is not supported by the passage.
  Option B is not supported by the passage as it suggests doing equivalent to an hour of brisk walking two or three times a week which is not exercising most days of the week.
  Option C is supported by the passage as it says it is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week.
  Option D is not supported by the passage as it suggests that there is no way of improving one's cardiovascular health aside from exercise which is not mentioned in the passage.
  Option E is not supported by the passage as it suggests that one must exercise strenuously at least occasionally to obtain a dramatic improvement in one's cardiovascular health.
  Therefore, the answer is C: It is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage mentions the amount of exercise needed to improve cardiovascular health.
  Doing half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  A strenuous workout is not necessary, but more vigorous exercise can be more effective.
  Option A is incorrect because it suggests that a strenuous workout is required.
  Option B is incorrect because it suggests that doing an hour of brisk walking two or three times a week is generally enough, but the passage mentions the need to exercise most days of the week.
  Option C is correct because it states that doing half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week is enough to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health as having a strenuous workout most days of the week.
  Option D is incorrect because the passage only mentions exercise as a way to improve cardiovascular health.
  Option E is incorrect because the passage states that a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.

Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage states that modest amounts of exercise, such as half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week, can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  The passage also notes that more vigorous exercise is more effective but not necessary.
  The passage does not suggest that a strenuous workout most days of the week is necessary.
  The passage does not suggest that exercise is the only way to improve cardiovascular health.
  The passage does not suggest that one must exercise strenuously at least occasionally to obtain a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  Choice C is the most strongly supported by the statements in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Modest amounts of exercise produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  One needs to exercise most days of the week to obtain cardiovascular benefits.
  Doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking is enough to achieve cardiovascular health benefits.
  More exercise can be done for further benefits, but it is not necessary to do a strenuous workout.
  Option A is false since the statements say that it is not necessary to do a strenuous workout.
  Option B is false since the statements do not say that doing the equivalent of an hour of brisk walking two or three times a week produces dramatic improvements.
  Option C is true since the statements say that doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking is enough to achieve cardiovascular health benefits and that more vigorous exercise is more effective but not necessary.
  Option D is false since the statements say exercise is necessary for cardiovascular health.
  Option E is false since the statements say that a strenuous workout is not necessary to achieve cardiovascular health benefits.
  Therefore, the answer is C: It is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  One should exercise most days of the week.
  Doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits is enough.
  More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
  Therefore, it is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week.
Action: Answer("C")

Option A is incorrect because it contradicts the statement that a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
Option B is incorrect because it suggests that there is a specific duration and frequency of exercise that produces dramatic improvements in cardiovascular health.
Option C is the correct answer because it summarizes the given information that the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week can produce at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health as having a strenuous workout most days of the week.
Option D is incorrect because it suggests that exercise is the only way to improve cardiovascular health.
Option E is incorrect because it suggests that strenuous exercise is necessary to obtain a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
  One should exercise most days of the week, but one need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.
  More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
  Choice A is not supported by the statements and is actually contradicted by the statement that a strenuous workout is not necessary.
  Choice B is not supported by the statements as it suggests that exercising only two or three times a week can produce dramatic improvements in cardiovascular health.
  Choice C is supported by the statements as it states that doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week can produce at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health as having a strenuous workout most days of the week.

-Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. 
-One should exercise most days of the week, but one needs to do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits.
-More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.

From this information, we can say that the statement that is most strongly supported is option C. It is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health, and one need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on most days of the week to obtain cardiovascular health benefits. 
  More vigorous exercise is more effective, but it is not necessary to have a strenuous workout.
  The passage implies that doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week is just as effective as having a strenuous workout most days of the week.
  Therefore, the answer is C: It is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases that are not present in the wild.
  Despite this, the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and the wild.
  To explain this discrepancy, we need to find an answer that tells us why the fatality rate is not higher in captivity.
  Choice A is not relevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice B provides information about the average life expectancy of sea turtles but does not address the discrepancy between captive and wild leatherbacks.
  Choice C focuses on wild leatherbacks and does not account for the survival rates of captive leatherbacks.
  Choice D may help explain the discrepancy but is not necessary to do so.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks. This statement could explain why captive leatherbacks are not more susceptible to fatal diseases.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  However, the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
  Therefore, we need to find an answer choice that helps explain why the life expectancy is about the same for leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild despite the fact that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  Answer choice C helps explain that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, which means that diseases aren't the primary cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that captive and wild leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching the theoretical maximum life expectancy.
  The argument also states that the captive leatherbacks are susceptible to diseases that wild leatherbacks never come into contact with.
  To resolve the apparent discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the captive leatherbacks are not dying more often than the wild leatherbacks.
  Answer choice A is incorrect because it talks about the diseases of other aquatic reptiles, not specifically leatherbacks.
  Answer choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Answer choice C talks about what causes the death of wild leatherbacks, but it does not give us any information about captive leatherbacks.
  Answer choice D is incorrect because it does not address the mortality rate of captive leatherbacks.
  Answer choice E seems to have no relevance to the argument.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices seem to be helpful in resolving the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases and leatherbacks in the wild are not.
  The argument also states that leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy as leatherbacks in the wild.
  Therefore, we need to find an option that explains why both of these statements can be true.
  Option C provides a reason why leatherbacks in the wild may not be affected by fatal diseases, as they are killed by predators before they can be affected.
  This supports the argument that leatherbacks in the wild have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy as leatherbacks in captivity.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument is about how the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild despite the fact that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find information that explains how leatherbacks in captivity can reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy despite being susceptible to fatal diseases.
  Choice A, B, C, D, and E do not address the apparent discrepancy in the argument. 
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have about the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
  The argument also states that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to a variety of fatal diseases not found in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the susceptibility to diseases does not seem to affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  Choice A does not address the discrepancy between captive and wild leatherbacks.
  Similarly, choice B provides irrelevant information.
  Choice C explains why leatherbacks in the wild might not live to their maximum life expectancy, but it does not explain why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and the wild.
  Choice D provides a reason why captive leatherbacks might not live to their maximum life expectancy, but it does not explain why the likelihood is the same in captivity and the wild.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  The best answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators. This suggests that the fatal diseases that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to do not significantly affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases if they are in captivity.
  The argument states that the same likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild, which is surprising.
  The discrepancy can be resolved by finding out why the same likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
  Options A, B, C, D, and E do not seem to be relevant to resolving the discrepancy.
  Option A provides a comparison with other large aquatic reptiles, which is not helpful in resolving the discrepancy.
  Option B is about the average life expectancy of sea turtles, not leatherbacks specifically.
  Option C is about the cause of death in the wild, which is not helpful in resolving the discrepancy.
  Option D is about the zoologist's knowledge, which is not helpful in resolving the discrepancy.
  Option E is about the size of a leatherback, which is not helpful in resolving the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to diseases they wouldn't get in the wild.
  Yet, their life expectancy is about the same in captivity and the wild.
  We need to find an option that would explain why there is no difference.
  Option A is not helpful in explaining the discrepancy.
  Option B is not useful in resolving the difference between leatherback life expectancy in captivity and the wild.
  Option C does not explain why leatherbacks in captivity live about as long as those in the wild.
  Option D is not relevant to explaining the discrepancy.
  Option E is also not helpful in resolving the discrepancy.
  Therefore, none of the options help resolve the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases but still reach their maximum life expectancy.
  The apparent discrepancy is that in the wild, leatherbacks are not subjected to the same diseases, yet they still only reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy.
  We need to find a reason why the life expectancy is not increased in the wild.
  Option C provides a reason as to why life expectancy is not increased in the wild.
  Thus, the answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The apparent discrepancy is that leatherbacks face more fatal diseases in captivity than in the wild, but their maximum life expectancy is the same in both conditions.
  The most helpful answer will explain why the maximum life expectancy is the same in both conditions despite the susceptibility of leatherbacks to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Answer choice A and B does not help in resolving the discrepancy.
  Answer choice C is out of context, as it seems to explain the death of wild leatherbacks, which is not related to the question.
  Answer choice D may explain why leatherbacks face fatal diseases in captivity, but it does not help in resolving the discrepancy.
  Answer choice E is out of context and does not help in resolving the discrepancy.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: History provides many examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable. This shows that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: People correctly believe that technological innovations often cause job loss.
  B: People are often reluctant to take on new challenges.
  C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
  D: People tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations.
  E: People correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find the option that suggests that the desire for comfort or safety is more powerful than social inertia.
  Options A, B, and D do not directly impact the argument.
  Option C has no impact on the argument because even if some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, the argument is discussing the general trend of resistance.
  Option E, however, suggests that people's desire for comfort and safety could be the primary reason for their willingness to adopt technological innovations.
  Therefore, option E most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety, using the example of people resisting technological innovations.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the idea that social inertia is the more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  Choice C, which states that some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, undermines the argument because it suggests that workers' desire for comfort and safety can be more powerful than social inertia, and that they can be willing to accept technological innovations that improve their working conditions.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that social inertia is a powerful determinant of human behavior.
  It states that technological innovations have been strongly resisted in the past.
  Therefore, we need to find a statement that challenges or contradicts these claims.
  If a statement suggests that people do not resist technological changes or that social inertia is not a determinant of human behavior, it would undermine the argument.
  Choice C suggests that some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers which contradicts the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety based on the premise that people resist technological innovations that improve their working conditions.
  If there is evidence that people do not always resist technological innovations, then this undermines the argument.
  Choice C provides this evidence by stating that some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument is that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  One way to undermine this argument is to show an example of when the desire for comfort or safety outweighs social inertia.
  If people correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity, then this could be a reason why people may not resist as much.
  Therefore, the answer is E: People correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the desire for comfort or safety is, in fact, a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
  Answer choice A is not relevant.
  Answer choice B is not relevant.
  Answer choice C might weaken the argument, but it does not necessarily suggest that the desire for comfort or safety is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
  Answer choice D might weaken the argument, but it does not necessarily suggest that the desire for comfort or safety is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
  Answer choice E may strengthen the argument, but it does not weaken the argument.
  Thus, the best answer is C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, suggesting that the desire for comfort or safety can be a more powerful determinant of human behavior than social inertia. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  The argument supports the claim by citing an example where people resisted technological innovations despite miserable working conditions.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a choice that weakens the claim that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
  Choice C provides an example where workers embraced technological innovation.
  If some examples exist where workers embrace technological innovation, then it weakens the claim that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
  Therefore, the most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
  The argument supports this claim by providing examples of technological innovations that were strongly resisted by people despite improving their working conditions.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that implies that the desire for comfort or safety is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than social inertia.
  Choice E suggests that people believe technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity, which could imply that the desire for comfort or safety is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than social inertia.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  It uses the idea that technological innovations have been strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable to support this claim.
  The correct answer should suggest that there are other factors besides social inertia that can explain why people resist technological innovations.
  Choice A might provide an alternative reason for the resistance, but it doesn't necessarily undermine the argument.
  Choice B is too vague to be relevant.
  Choice C weakens the argument by suggesting that the resistance is not universal.
  Choice D would strengthen the argument by suggesting that resistance is not likely, but it doesn't necessarily undermine the argument.
  Choice E is not relevant because the argument is not about the effects of technological innovations on productivity.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is that social inertia is stronger than the desire for comfort or safety.
  If there are cases where workers embrace technological innovation, then the argument would be weaker because it demonstrates that people are not always resistant to change.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that Harrold Foods dominates the market because more than 50% of consumers believe that their product already dominates the market.
  However, the survey does not provide information on the actual sales of the product in the market.
  The argument is committing an error of equating consumer perception with market share.
  The argument is mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
  The argument uses the survey results to support that Hero already dominates the market without considering other factors or competitors that are not mentioned in the context.
  The argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that having more than 50% of sales in a market means that a product is dominant.
  The argument also assumes that Harrold Foods currently has more than 50% of sales in the market for carbonated drinks.
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and will continue to do so if it maintains its current market share.
  The argument does not commit the error described in options A, C, D, or E.
  Option B describes the error of mistaking a necessary condition for a sufficient condition.
  The argument assumes that having more than 50% of sales is sufficient to be dominant in the market, but it is possible that other factors could make a product dominant even if it has less than 50% of sales.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error described in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  It also claims that any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market.
  Therefore, Harrold Foods already dominates the market and only needs to maintain its current market share.
  However, the argument seems to mistake a condition that is required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The argument fails to consider that other companies may use different advertising campaigns to promote their own products and may gain more market share by doing so.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods already dominates the market and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so because survey results show that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The survey results are used as evidence to support the conclusion that Harrold Foods dominates the market and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
  However, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The survey results show that "Hero" already dominates the market because it has more than 50 percent of the sales in the market. But it is not guaranteed that Harrold Foods will continue to dominate the market just by maintaining its current market share, as there could be competitors that could capture more market share in the future.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods already dominates the soft-drink market since 72% of consumers say that "Hero" dominates the market, which means it has more than 50% of the sales in the market.
  The argument fails to recognize that the survey results are about consumers' opinions and not actual sales data.
  Therefore, the argument is committing the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market and only needs to maintain its current market share to continue doing so.
  The argument uses the fact that 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market as evidence for its conclusion.
  However, the fact that consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market does not necessarily mean that it actually does.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are accurate and that the current market share of Harrold Foods will remain the same, which is a mistake.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the soft-drink market because their product "Hero" is the most popular and has more than 50% sales in the market.
  The argument is based on the belief that because the majority of consumers perceive "Hero" to already dominate the market, it will continue to do so in the future.
  However, the argument's conclusion rests solely on past data and does not account for changes in consumer preferences or the entrance of new competitors.
  The argument is committing the error of assuming that past results will necessarily be replicated in the future, despite potential changes in the market. 
  Therefore, the answer is E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market because of the survey result showing 72% believe "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument uses a questionable definition of "dominant."
  Just because 72% of consumers believe "Hero" dominates the market, it doesn't mean that it necessarily dominates.
  The argument uses a survey result that was obtained in the past to describe a current market condition.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and only need to maintain its current market share. 
  The argument provides evidence that 72% of all consumers think "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that only having more than 50% of the sales in the market is the only requirement for dominating the market.
  The argument does not commit the error of failing to exclude a possibility or mistaking a condition for another.
  The argument does not treat the failure to establish a claim as equivalent to a demonstration that the claim is true.
  The argument does not take evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Response 0:
Thought:
Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
They are identified by their mass and whether lithium is present in their atmospheres.
Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
Brown dwarfs cannot consume lithium because they do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace.
Therefore, the option that is most strongly supported is option E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
The journalist states that brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere, including those that are less massive than the Sun, are ones where the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed. 
Option A is incorrect because the journalist states that stars with less mass than the sun have no lithium. This means there could be other celestial objects without lithium that are not stars with less mass than the Sun. 
Option B is incorrect because the journalist does not state that incomplete mixing of elements in a nuclear furnace is the only way for a celestial object to have lithium in its atmosphere. 
Option C is incorrect because the journalist states that brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed. This means there could be other celestial objects without lithium that are not brown dwarfs. 
Option D is incorrect because the journalist states that stars with at least as much mass as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres. This means there could be other celestial objects with lithium that have as much mass as the Sun or more. 
Option E is correct because the journalist states that brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed. This means no celestial object with less mass than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars more massive than the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because of incomplete mixing of elements in their nuclear furnaces.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace so their lithium cannot be consumed.
  Therefore, the option that best summarizes the Science Journalist's statements is option B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so their lithium cannot be consumed.
  Therefore, the presence or absence of lithium in a celestial object's atmosphere is related to the object's mass and whether it has a functional nuclear furnace.
  Choice A is incorrect because the journalist only discussed the absence of lithium, not the presence of it.
  Choice B is incorrect because the journalist only discussed the presence of lithium, not the furnace's incomplete mixing of elements.
  Choice C is incorrect because brown dwarfs have no lithium in their atmospheres, but there could be other celestial objects without lithium.
  Choice D is incorrect because the journalist did not mention the mass of celestial objects with lithium in their atmospheres.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because it has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace, so their lithium cannot be consumed.
  The journalist did not mention anything about celestial objects less massive than brown dwarfs.
  Option A is not true because the journalist only said stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, not all celestial objects.
  Option B is incorrect because the journalist stated that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because of incomplete mixing of elements.
  Option C is false since brown dwarfs are celestial objects without lithium in their atmospheres.
  Option D is incorrect because the journalist did not mention anything about the mass of celestial objects with lithium in their atmospheres.
  Option E is true because the journalist said brown dwarfs are the only celestial objects without lithium, and they are more massive than objects with lithium.
  The answer is E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium in their atmospheres.
  Brown dwarfs don't have a functional nuclear furnace, so they can't consume lithium.
  Therefore, all brown dwarfs have lithium in their atmospheres.
  All celestial objects with lithium in their atmospheres have nuclear furnaces that didn't fully mix the object's elements.
  Therefore, B is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with mass between planets and stars.
  Brown dwarfs have no fully functional nuclear furnace.
  Lithium is present in the atmosphere of brown dwarfs.
  Stars with at least the same mass as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  Therefore, the option that is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements is option C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
  Therefore, any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  The journalist does not mention anything about no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere being Brown Dwarf.
  The journalist does not mention anything about no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere having less mass than the Sun.
  The journalist does not mention anything about a celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf having lithium in its atmosphere.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
  The journalist's statements support that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. None of the other options are strongly supported by the given information.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  Most players take several weeks to complete the game.
  This means that people who rented the game would have returned it before completing it.
  So, if people who rented the game and completed it are taking the rebate and purchasing the game, this means that sales would increase.
  Choice B supports this logic, and hence, it is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The publisher's prediction is that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  The sales are currently meeting expectations, and rentals are exceeding expectations.
  To justify the publisher's prediction, we need to ensure that the sales will continue to exceed expectations.
  Option B, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction because it implies that players will have to rent the game for more than two days, leading to more revenue from rentals. Additionally, it implies that players may be more likely to purchase the game after renting it multiple times and becoming more invested in it. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The publisher's prediction is that sales of the game will exceed expectations soon.
  The rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations.
  The justification for the publisher's prediction should explain how the rate of sales will increase.
  Choice B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game could explain why the rate of sales could increase.
  It could be that players who rented the game will not finish it within two days and may decide to purchase it instead.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an answer that indicates that sales of the game are likely to increase.
  Option B suggests that players take several weeks to complete the game, which may mean they will eventually opt to purchase the game instead of renting it multiple times.
  Therefore, B is the most helpful answer that justifies the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The publisher's prediction is that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to look for an option that indicates the game's popularity increasing.
  Option B doesn't give any justification for the game's popularity or increasing sales.
  Option A is not relevant to the popularity of the game.
  Option C is favorable but does not necessarily indicate that the game's popularity or sales will increase.
  Option D is unfavorable and does not suggest that the game's popularity or sales will increase.
  Option E is unfavorable and does not suggest that the game's popularity or sales will increase.
  Therefore, we can choose option C which indicates the game publisher's games are among the most popular games on the market and increasing its sales accordingly.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need an option that supports the increase in sales.
  Option A is irrelevant.
  Option B suggests that it takes a long time to complete the game, which may decrease sales.
  Option C indicates that the publisher's games are popular, but this is not related to the current game's sales.
  Option D suggests that most players do not play the game extensively afterward, which may not contribute to the increase in sales.
  Option E suggests that some people may buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, which does not support the increase in sales.
  Therefore, none of the options helps to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The publisher's prediction is about sales exceeding expectations.
  The rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations.
  To justify the prediction, we need to find an option that supports sales increasing further.
  Option A doesn't provide any information about sales.
  Option B might indicate that sales could increase because players will keep renting or purchasing the game while trying to complete it.
  Option C might be true, but it doesn't explain why sales will exceed expectations.
  Option D suggests that the game might not have long-term replay value, which doesn't support the prediction.
  Option E doesn't support the prediction either since it doesn't say anything about the game's sales.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The publisher's prediction is that sales of the game will also exceed expectations, while rentals are already exceeding expectations.
  So, we need to find an answer that supports the idea that sales will increase.
  Choice B states that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game. This means that they are likely to purchase the game instead of renting it multiple times.
  If players take weeks to complete the game, they may want to buy it instead of renting it. This would lead to an increase in sales.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The publisher expects the sales of the game to exceed expectations.
  Which of the given options, if true, would justify the prediction?
  Option A is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option B suggests that people will take longer to complete the game which might lead to increased rentals and sales.
  Option C is an already known fact and does not prove anything about the prediction.
  Option D suggests that after completing the game, people might not play it again and hence, may not buy it. This contradicts the prediction.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The game's rental option is popular and can lead to sales.
  The rate of rentals is exceeding expectations.
  If the publisher can provide a justification for why rental rates are higher than sales, then it is likely that sales will also increase.
  Choice B provides a justification for why rental rates are higher than sales. If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then renting the game multiple times may be more cost-effective than purchasing it outright.
  Therefore, choice B most helps to justify the publisher's prediction.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that if the party's economic theories had been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. However, the inflation rate increased. Thus, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  This is an example of a flawed reasoning that involves a conditional statement that is taken to be a sufficient condition when it is not. 
  Choice (C) presents a similar flawed reasoning whereby the argument claims that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  The reasoning involves a conditional statement that is taken to be a sufficient condition when it is not.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument claims that if the party's economic theories had been sound, then the inflation rate would have lessened.
  But the inflation rate actually increased.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that the party's economic theories were far off the mark.
  The flawed reasoning in the argument is that it assumes that the party's economic theories were the only factor that could have affected the inflation rate, and that if the theories were sound, the rate would have gone down. It ignores any other potential factors that could have influenced the rate.
  Choice C has a similar flawed reasoning where it assumes that the company's failure to sell its subsidiaries was the only reason the stock price did not increase.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
The argument above assumes that the success of the party's economic theories is the only factor that could have affected the inflation rate, which is not necessarily true.
Option A is flawed because it assumes that the only thing that could change the valley's architecture are invasions or climatic changes.
Option B is flawed because it assumes that workers will not strike just because they promised not to.
Option C has the same flaw as the argument above because it assumes that there is only one way the company stock price would double.
Option D is flawed because it assumes that the only way residents would show support for the rebels is if they won the battle.
Option E has the same flaw as the argument above because it assumes that the new equipment is the only factor that could have affected the television station's ratings.
Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have reduced. However, since the inflation rate increased, their theories are incorrect. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories are the only factor affecting inflation. It ignores other variables that could have contributed to the rise in inflation. 
  Looking at the given choices, option C has similar flawed reasoning. It assumes that the only factor affecting the increase in the stock price is the company's ability to sell its subsidiaries. It ignores other variables that could have influenced the stock price.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states a hypothetical situation that did not occur as a fact, then concludes that the theory behind the hypothetical situation is wrong.
  Option A argues that because the people in the valley did not change their architecture, they must not have been invaded, based on a hypothetical situation.
  Option B argues that because workers have promised not to strike, they must not think the opposition party will cut wages, based on a hypothetical situation.
  Option C argues that because the stock price did not increase, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries, based on a hypothetical situation.
  Option D argues that because the residents showed support for the rebels, the rebels must have won the battle, based on a hypothetical situation.
  Option E argues that because the station's ratings actually decreased, the new equipment is no improvement on the old, based on a hypothetical situation.
  Option C is the most similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that if the party's economic theories were sound and its program were implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably.
  However, the inflation rate increased instead.
  Therefore, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The flawed reasoning in the argument is that it assumes a causal relationship between the party's economic theories and the inflation rate, without considering other factors that could have influenced the inflation rate.
  Choice C is similar in that it assumes a causal relationship between a certain business decision and the stock price, without considering other factors that could have influenced the stock price.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, then the inflation rate would have decreased, but it increased instead. 
  This is an example of a flawed causal argument, where the party's economic theories are assumed to be the sole and sufficient cause of the inflation rate, which ignores other possible factors that could have affected the inflation rate.
  Thus, the answer is the one that most closely resembles this same flawed reasoning.
  Choice C claims that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time, and thus the argument concludes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. 
  This is also a flawed causal argument, as it assumes that the failure to sell the subsidiaries is the sole and sufficient cause of the failure of the stock price to increase, ignoring other factors that could have affected the stock price.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented successfully, the inflation rate would have lessened but as the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
  The reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the inflation rate increased because the party's economic theories were not sound, while other factors may have contributed to the increase.
  Choice C also assumes that a particular outcome would have occurred if a certain condition was met, while ignoring other factors that could have impacted the situation.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound, then the inflation rate would have decreased and since the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were far off the mark.
  This is an example of a conditional statement and its inverse.
  The reasoning is flawed because the inverse of a conditional statement is not always true.
  Choice C is the closest to this pattern of flawed reasoning.
  It assumes that if the company had sold its subsidiaries, then the stock price would have doubled and because the stock price did not double, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories had been sound, inflation rate would have lessened.
  But inflation increased, therefore the economic theories are far off the mark.
  This implies that the reasoning is based on the assumption of an ideal scenario that didn't occur.
  Choice C has a similar reasoning, stating that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries, its stock price would have doubled.
  But because the stock price didn't increase, it is assumed that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries, based on an ideal scenario.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Government official: Residents who are foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries. This is wise, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. So, ____.
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the government official's statement?
Choices:
  A: foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve
  B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries
  C: only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries
  D: foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries
  E: cabinet undersecretaries should not be expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument states that foreign citizens are allowed to serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries.
  The official explains this decision by stating that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should only be performed by citizens.
  The official also explains that a cabinet undersecretary may serve as a cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, it makes sense to conclude that foreign citizens should not be appointed to a position that involves performing duties that only a citizen should perform.
  This implies that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  The answer is D: foreign citizens should not be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that foreign citizens cannot serve as cabinet secretaries because of some duties that only citizens should perform.
  Moreover, cabinet undersecretaries serve as cabinet secretaries when necessary.
  The government official wants to complete the argument logically.
  Therefore, the answer should be consistent with the initial argument.
  Thus, the answer is either B, stating that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries, or D, stating that foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries.
  However, since the initial argument says that some duties can only be performed by citizens, it is less likely that foreign citizens will be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries.
  Thus, the answer is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The government official claims that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should only be performed by citizens.
  The official also believes that no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that they should not perform.
  The official states that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to fill in for the cabinet secretary when they are not available.
  Therefore, the statement that most logically completes the official's argument would indicate what should happen with cabinet undersecretaries.
  The idea that cabinet undersecretaries should not be expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries would contradict the official's statement that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries.
  The official does not support the idea that foreign citizens should be appointed as cabinet secretaries since they must perform duties that should only be performed by citizens.
  Choice A is not related to the official's argument and is not a logical completion of the argument.
  Choice C is not mentioned in the given argument, and it does not logically complete the official's argument.
  Choice D contradicts the official's argument that cabinet secretaries must perform duties that should only be performed by citizens.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries because cabinet undersecretaries are expected to stand in for the cabinet secretary when they are unavailable. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The government official states that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries since some duties should be performed only by citizens.
  The official also states that undersecretaries should be able to serve as secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, the official is likely to suggest that foreign citizens should not be appointed as undersecretaries, as they may eventually need to perform duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  Choice B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries, most logically completes the government official's statement.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens can serve as public servants, but not as cabinet secretaries, since they perform duties that should only be performed by citizens. 
  Cabinet undersecretaries should be able to serve as cabinet secretaries, which implies that they are citizens eligible for the position.
  Therefore, the logical completion of the government official's statement must be consistent with the premise that some duties can only be performed by citizens.
  Answer choice A is not related to the argument.
  Answer choice B contradicts the fact that cabinet undersecretaries should be able to serve as cabinet secretaries.
  Answer choice C is not related to the argument.
  Answer choice D contradicts the premise that cabinet secretaries perform duties that should only be performed by citizens.
  Answer choice E is not related to the argument.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because there are duties that only citizens should perform.
  Also, undersecretaries are expected to serve as secretaries when the latter are unavailable.
  Therefore, if undersecretaries cannot be appointed as cabinet secretaries, it would be problematic to have foreign citizens appointed to such positions.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument made by the official.
  Option B is a possible answer because it states that foreign citizens should not be appointed as undersecretaries, but there is no argument given for this.
  Option C is illogical because cabinet secretaries are appointed first and not after serving as undersecretaries.
  Option D contradicts the argument made by the official.
  Option E contradicts the given premise that cabinet undersecretaries should be able to serve as cabinet secretaries when necessary.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The government official argues that it is wise not to appoint foreign citizens as cabinet secretaries.
  The official claims that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that only citizens should perform.
  Additionally, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, the statement should logically complete with an explanation why foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  The answer is D: foreign citizens should not be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not serve as cabinet secretaries.
  The reason is that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that only citizens should perform.
  The official also argues that a cabinet undersecretary should serve as a cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, the statement would logically complete with an additional claim that supports the argument.
  Option A is irrelevant since it does not address the original argument.
  Option B is not necessary since the official's argument is only about cabinet secretaries.
  Option C is incorrect because it is too narrow and does not address the original argument.
  Option D contradicts the original argument and is not logically sound.
  Option E is incorrect since it contradicts the official's argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries, since a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as a cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The government official explains why foreign citizens cannot be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
  The reason is that cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  A cabinet undersecretary serves as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable, so the undersecretary should also be a citizen.
  Therefore, the answer should match the government official's reasoning.
  The only answer that does this is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The government official argues that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries because some duties are reserved for citizens only.
  Moreover, cabinet undersecretaries are expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries, so they must also be citizens.
  Therefore, it would be illogical for foreign citizens to be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.
  Choice A's suggestion that foreign citizens should be granted citizenship in the country they serve is not directly relevant to the official's argument.
  Choice C's suggestion that only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries is unrelated to the argument.
  Choice D's suggestion that foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries contradicts the official's argument that some duties are reserved for citizens only.
  Choice E's suggestion that cabinet undersecretaries should not be expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries is irrelevant to the official's argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries, as this is consistent with the official's argument that some duties are reserved for citizens only and that undersecretaries should be able to serve as secretaries when needed.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission supports development of wetlands for growth and argues that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development should be regulated to protect wildlife, and any wetland lost should be replaced by a new one.
  One principle that would strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position would be that individual nations have the right to govern their own resources and make decisions about their economic growth.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. This principle would support the Figorian Development Commission's position by arguing that they should be allowed to continue developing their resources as they see fit, rather than having to follow strict regulations because of the actions of other nations. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission is in favor of development, while the Figorian Wildlife Commission is in favor of regulating wetland development to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources and that wetland development might not necessarily harm wildlife.
  The principle that would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position would be one that prioritizes economic growth and development over wildlife conservation.
  Choice B prioritizes preserving wildlife over economic needs, so it does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice A suggests international regulation of natural resources to protect wildlife, which goes against the Figorian Development Commission's stance on governing their own resources.
  Choice C suggests regulating development only after damage has been done, which does not align with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  Choice D suggests that all nations should be held to the same standard of environmental regulation, which also goes against the Figorian Development Commission's stance on governing their own resources.
  Choice E suggests that further depletion of natural resources is unwise, but it does not necessarily support or oppose either commission's position.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment, which aligns with the Figorian Development Commission's stance on allowing development. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria should be able to develop its own resources.
  This suggests that the principle of national sovereignty might be relevant.
  National sovereignty refers to the idea that a nation has the right to govern its own resources.
  Therefore, if the principle of national sovereignty were accepted, it would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  The answer is E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate wetland development to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission wants to allow wetland development to support growth.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position would most strongly be supported if a principle is accepted that prioritizes the rights of individual nations to govern their own resources.
  Therefore, the best choice is D: "Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is to allow wetland development because it might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission's position is to regulate wetland development by offsetting it with the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission claims that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  The principle that would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position would be a principle that supports their right to govern their own resources and prioritize economic growth.
  Choice A doesn't support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice B prioritizes the preservation of wildlife over economic needs, which doesn't support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice C supports regulation after a reduction of populations of endangered species has taken place, which doesn't support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice D emphasizes preventing any further environmental damage, which doesn't support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice E prioritizes natural resource preservation over growth, which doesn't support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.

  The Figorian Development Commission believes that development is necessary for growth and they have the right to govern their resources.
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that regulation of wetland development is necessary to protect endangered species and their habitats.
  The principle that most strongly supports the Figorian Development Commission's position would be one that prioritizes economic growth and national sovereignty over environmental protection.
  Choice B prioritizes wildlife preservation over economic needs, which would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  Choice A suggests that international agreement is necessary to regulate national resources, which would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice C suggests that regulation should only be implemented after damage has already been done, which would not support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  Choice D suggests that environmental regulation should not consider the different degrees of harm that different nations have already caused, which would not support either position.
  Choice E suggests that further depletion of natural resources is imprudent, which would not strongly support either position.
  Therefore, the answer is A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered, which opposes the Figorian Development Commission's position and supports their belief that regulation should come from within the nation. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate wetland development and offset it with the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that such regulation is unnecessary and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
  The question asks which principle would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice A talks about regulating national resources by international agreement, which is not directly related to the situation in Figoria.
  Choice B prioritizes the preservation of wildlife over economic needs, which is the opposite of the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice C suggests that regulation should only be implemented after a certain level of damage has been done, which is not aligned with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  Choice D suggests that environmental regulation must aim to prevent any further damage, which is in line with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  Choice E suggests that it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources, but it does not support either side of the argument specifically.
  Therefore, the principle that most strongly supports the Figorian Development Commission's position is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission advocates that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figorian wetland development is necessary for growth and that they have as much right to govern their own resources as other countries.
  Choice A is not in favor of the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice B supersedes economic needs and supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  Choice C is inconsistent with the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice D is not in favor of the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice E is inconsistent with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  Therefore, the answer is E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission is arguing that Figoria should be allowed to govern its own resources.
  They also argue that wetland development in other countries has not been regulated and has been detrimental to wildlife. 
  They believe that Figorian development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  The principle that supports their argument is likely to be one that emphasizes a nation's right to self-governance and development.
  Option A focuses on international regulation, which contradicts Figorian Development Commission's argument.
  Option B prioritizes the preservation of wildlife over economic needs, which goes against the Figorian Development Commission's argument.
  Option C suggests that regulation should only take place after harm has been caused, rather than preventing harm in the first place.
  Option D emphasizes preventing any further environmental damage, which is not the Figorian Development Commission's argument.
  Option E may be a reasonable principle, but it does not directly support the Figorian Development Commission's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. This option emphasizes the need to prevent further harm, which goes against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's proposal to allow development as long as it is offset by habitat construction. The Figorian Development Commission believes that their development may not harm wildlife and would not cause a net reduction in wetlands. Therefore, they would support the idea that regulations should not be based on past damage already caused by other countries.
Response 9:
Thought:
The Figorian Development Commission believes that they have the right to govern their own resources.
They also believe that wetland development is necessary for growth.
Therefore, the principle that would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position would be one that supports the idea of a nation's right to govern their own resources.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The columnist believes that the democracy is not well-functioning.
  The reason for it is that the influential people are not letting a bill that would benefit most people be passed into law.
  The columnist believes that if a democracy is well-functioning, then the bills that are favored by most people should become laws within a few years even if opposed by some influential people.
  Choice B matches the columnist's reasoning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that the country is not a well-functioning democracy.
  The reason being that bills that are favored by most people do not pass into law due to the influence of a few people who would be adversely affected by the bills.
  Choice B supports the columnist's reasoning by stating that a bill favored by most people but opposed by influential people will eventually pass into law in a well-functioning democracy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people will not be passed into law because influential people are opposed to it.
  The columnist implies that a democracy must pass laws favored by the majority, not the minority.
  Choice B most justifies the columnist's reasoning because it states if a democracy is functioning well, a bill favored by the majority but opposed by the minority will eventually pass into law.
  Therefore, the answer is B: if a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The columnist is arguing that a bill that is supported by most people and doesn't violate anyone's basic human rights isn't being passed because of the influence of those who would be adversely affected.
Option A: This answer option is not valid because it states that if a bill would benefit most people, it will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights, which is not related to the columnist's argument.
Option B: This answer option is also not valid because it states that a bill opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. However, the columnist is arguing that even if most people favor the bill, it will not be passed because of the influence of those who would be adversely affected.
Option C: This answer option aligns with the columnist's reasoning. The columnist is arguing that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. This answer option is valid as it supports the argument made by the columnist.
Option D: This answer option is not valid because it states that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights, but the columnist is not arguing that the bill has violated anyone's human rights.
Option E: This answer option is not valid because it states that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, which is not related to the columnist's argument.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that a bill supported by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights will not pass if influential people oppose it.
  The best principle that justifies this reasoning is B, which states that a well-functioning democracy will eventually pass a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights will not be passed into law.
  The reason for this is that those who would be adversely affected are very influential.
  The principle that justifies this the most is that a bill favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  Therefore, the answer is C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The columnist argues that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will not be passed into law in a well-functioning democracy if those people who would be adversely affected by the bill are very influential.
  The principle that best justifies this reasoning is B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  This principle suggests that the reason the bill is unlikely to pass is not because the democracy is not well-functioning, but because the influential people opposed to the bill are preventing its passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people, which does not violate anyone's rights, is unlikely to become law if influential people oppose it.
  Principle A is irrelevant because it mentions nothing about influential people opposing a bill.
  Principle B is consistent with the columnist's argument.
  Principle C strengthens the columnist's argument by linking the bill's passage to the influence of those who oppose it.
  Principle D is irrelevant because it does not mention influential people opposing a bill.
  Principle E is similar to Principle A and is also irrelevant.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The columnist's reasoning is that a bill that benefits most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will not be passed because it is opposed by influential people.
  The principle that justifies the columnist's reasoning must account for a scenario where most people favor the bill but it is still not passed, and that the opposition to the bill is from influential people.
  Choice B comes closest to this principle.
  Choice A and E state that a bill that benefits most people and does not violate their basic rights will be passed into law in a few years, but this is not true in the case presented by the columnist.
  Choice C states that a bill will become law within a few years if the opposition is not very influential, but the columnist's reasoning implies that influential opposition is a barrier to the passage of the bill.
  Choice D does not account for opposition to the bill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
The columnist's argument is based on the fact that the bill that most people favor will not be passed into law because of the influence of those who would be adversely affected by it. Therefore, the principle that would best justify the columnist's reasoning is that a well-functioning democracy would not allow influential people to prevent the passage of a bill that is favored by most people, as it violates the democratic ideal that says everyone's opinion counts equally.

Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations and that if we had six fingers, we would be just as content with that configuration.
  The answer choice that most strengthens the biologist's argument would provide evidence that supports the idea that the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not important.
  Answer choice A is irrelevant to the biologist's argument.
  Answer choice B is not supported by the biologist's argument because the argument states that the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not important.
  Answer choice C is consistent with the biologist's argument, but it does not strengthen it.
  Answer choice D is consistent with the biologist's argument, but it does not strengthen it.
  Answer choice E is consistent with the biologist's argument and supports the idea that our configuration of fingers is not unique.
  Therefore, the best answer choice is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the configuration of our fingers is arbitrary and not inherently better or worse than other configurations.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to find an option that shows that people can be content with other configurations of fingers.
  Option A is not sufficient to strengthen the argument.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about the usefulness of things, not about contentment.
  Option C is too strong and goes beyond the scope of the argument.
  Option D could be a possible answer, but it goes beyond the scope of the argument.
  Option E suggests that there is a possibility of a fish with six phalanges in its fins, which supports the argument that a six-finger configuration is possible and could have been just as useful as the current five-finger configuration.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  The biologist also argues that if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to show that humans are equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is contradictory to the biologist's claim.
  Option C strengthens the biologist's argument.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E is interesting but does not strengthen the biologist's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument states that the configuration of fingers we have is not superior to several other configurations.
  The biologist also points out that if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
  Therefore, if we knew that such a configuration was present in one or more fish species, then it would support the biologist's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that humans are no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. The argument can be strengthened if we find evidence that supports it.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B weakens the argument because it suggests that humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  Option C supports the argument but it is too general to be considered the best answer.
  Option D can be a possible answer but it is too strong to be considered the best answer.
  Option E supports the biologist's argument by providing evidence that at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that the configuration of five fingers is not inherently better or worse than other configurations.
  The argument states that if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
  The best way to strengthen the biologist's argument is to provide evidence that supports the idea that the number of fingers is not important.
  Choice E, if true, would provide evidence that other species have different configurations and suggest that the number of fingers is not important.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that humans' five fingers are not inherently better than other possible configurations of fingers.
  To strengthen this argument, we need evidence that humans are content with other configurations.
  Option A does not provide any evidence that humans could be content with other configurations.
  Option B suggests that humans are not content with two things of unequal usefulness which does not strengthen the argument.
  Option C is similar to Option A and does not provide any evidence to support the argument.
  Option D might be relevant but is too extreme and vague to strengthen the argument.
  Option E provides evidence that supports the argument by showing that at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins, which strengthens the argument that humans could also be content with six fingers on each hand.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
The biologist is arguing that humans' configuration of fingers is not inherently better or worse than any other possible configuration. Therefore, any evidence that supports this claim will strengthen the argument.
A: This choice does not provide any evidence about the usefulness of different configurations of fingers.
B: This choice incorrectly assumes that humans cannot be content with two things of unequal usefulness. It is not relevant to the argument.
C: This choice could be relevant to the argument, but it is presented as a generalization that does not provide any specific evidence.
D: This choice supports the biologist's claim that our perception of the usefulness of our finger configuration is not based on objective facts. It strengthens the argument.
E: This choice provides evidence that there are fish species with six phalanges in their fins. This is interesting, but it is not directly relevant to the argument about the usefulness of different finger configurations in humans.
Therefore, the answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that humans could be content with a different number of fingers if it had evolved that way.
  The answer that strengthens this argument needs to suggest that humans are content with different numbers of fingers or that humans are not limited to only one configuration of fingers. 
  Option A does not provide any information that supports the argument.
  Option B suggests that humans are not content with less useful things, but the argument is about equally useful things.
  Option C suggests that humans are always equally content with equally useful things, but this does not necessarily apply to the argument.
  Option D supports the argument by suggesting that our preferences for our current configuration of fingers are based on prejudices rather than actual usefulness.
  Option E does not support the argument or strengthen it in any way. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
The biologist's argument is about the contentment of humans with their fingers' configuration. 
This argument assumes that human contentment is independent of the number of fingers they have. 
The answer choice that reinforces this assumption will strengthen the biologist's argument. 
Answer C directly supports the assumption that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness, regardless of how many fingers they have. 
Answer C is the best choice.

Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument is that dried parsley should never be used in cooking for it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  The argument suggests that fresh parsley is superior to dried parsley.
  E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients is the principle that supports the argument.
  The answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
The argument is that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley. 
This argument implies a general principle that fresh ingredients are superior to dried ones. 
Choice E is the only option that closely matches this principle.
Therefore, the answer is E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument is against the use of dried parsley, and claims that it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  We are asked to select the principle that helps to justify the argument.
  Choice A is about using fresh ingredients, that is generally true, but it doesn't directly justify the argument.
  Choice B is too strong, as the argument isn't necessarily about only using the tastiest ingredients.
  Choice C is too broad; the argument is only about dried parsley, not all ingredients.
  Choice D is too strong; the argument doesn't say that all parsley that isn't both tasty and healthful should never be used.
  Choice E directly states that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients, which helps justify the argument that dried parsley should never be used.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument presents a claim that dried parsley is inferior to fresh parsley in taste and health benefits.
  It implies that fresh ingredients are better than dried ingredients in cooking. 
  Therefore, the principle that most clearly helps justify the argument is that in cooking, fresh ingredients are superior to dried ingredients.
  The best answer is E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
The argument states that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful compared to fresh parsley. The principle that justifies this argument states that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients. Hence, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
The argument is that dried parsley should not be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
Which of the following principles would support this argument?
Option A: This choice is close, but it does not specifically state that dried herbs are inferior to fresh herbs in cooking.
Option B: This choice is too extreme. The argument is not that only the tastiest ingredients should be used but that dried parsley is less tasty than fresh parsley.
Option C: This choice is too generalized. The argument is specific to parsley and does not address other ingredients that should not be used.
Option D: This choice is too narrow. The argument is not that only parsley that is both tasty and healthful should be used but that fresh parsley is more tasty and healthful than dried parsley.
Option E: This choice most clearly helps to justify the argument above. The argument is that dried parsley is inferior to fresh parsley in cooking. This choice states that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients in cooking.
The answer is E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  The principle that would most justify the argument would be one that indicates that fresh ingredients are generally better than dried ingredients in cooking.
  Choice A states that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible, which aligns with the argument.
  This principle is also more general than choice D, as it refers to fresh ingredients in general, not just parsley.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument is against using dried parsley in cooking.
  The argument is based on the notion that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  The argument assumes that using fresh parsley is better than using dried parsley.
  The principle that most clearly helps to justify the argument is that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
Action: Answer("A")

  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking.
  It implies that dried parsley is less tasty and less healthful than fresh parsley.
  The argument is based on the assumption that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
  Option A, B, and D are not related to the argument.
  Option C is not strong enough to justify the argument.
  The only option that most clearly helps to justify the argument above is E because the argument is based on the assumption that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley. 
Principle A is close to the argument, but the argument does not claim that fresh ingredients should always be used. 
Principle B is incorrect since taste is not the only factor that determines whether an ingredient should be used.
Principle C is incorrect because the argument does not make a generalization about all ingredients that should never be used in cooking.
Principle D is incorrect because the argument only applies to parsley and not to all ingredients.
Principle E is the most relevant principle. It states that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients in cooking, which supports the argument that dried parsley should not be used in cooking. 
The answer is E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  We are looking for the statement that does NOT weaken the detective's argument.
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries since an accountant would not make such mistakes.
  A, B, C, and D all provide alternative explanations that weaken the detective's conclusion.
  E does not provide an alternative explanation that weakens the argument, but rather suggests a situation that would support the detective's conclusion.
  Therefore, E is the statement that does NOT weaken the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as an actuary because accountants would not have made the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find an option that does not weaken the argument.
  Option A weakens the argument because it suggests that supervisors had a closer eye on the actuaries.
  Option B suggests that persons outside the corporation could have had access to the financial records, which weakens the argument.
  Option C does not weaken the argument because it just provides information about the number of accountants and actuaries employed.
  Option D does not weaken the argument because the report was released before the crime took place.
  Option E weakens the argument because it suggests that the security measures made it harder for the actuaries to access the financial records.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
The detective's argument is that the embezzler must have been an actuary because the accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. 
Option A, which states that the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized than the activities of the accountants, supports the detective's argument. 
Options B, C, D, and E all provide alternative explanations for the embezzlement, hence weaken the detective's argument. 
Option B suggests that outsiders may have had access to the corporation's internal financial records and embezzled the money. 
Option C indicates that there are more accountants employed than actuaries, which means that the embezzler could have been an accountant. 
Option D implies that the corporation had vulnerabilities that may have been exploited by the embezzler. 
Option E implies that the actuaries were less likely to have access to internal financial records than the accountants. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to find the statement that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely to be an actuary because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  Statement A weakens the argument because it suggests that the accountants' activities were not scrutinized as closely as the actuaries' activities.
  Statement B weakens the argument because it suggests that persons outside XYZ Corporation could have been responsible for the breach, not one of the actuaries.
  Statement C weakens the argument because it suggests there are more accountants than actuaries, increasing the likelihood that the embezzler was an accountant.
  Statement D weakens the argument because it suggests that the corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place, meaning that the embezzler could have been an accountant or someone else.
  Statement E weakens the argument because it suggests that the actuaries had less access to internal financial records than the accountants, making it less likely that one of the actuaries was the embezzler.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  In order to weaken the detective's argument, we need to provide evidence that contradicts the assumption that the embezzler was an actuary.
  Choice A indicates that the actuaries may have been less likely to commit the crime, thereby strengthening the detective's argument.
  Choice B suggests that someone outside the company may have committed the crime, undermining the detective's argument.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D states that the company was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place, but it does not contradict the detective's argument.
  Choice E may indicate that the accountant had greater access to internal financial records, thereby weakening the detective's argument.
  Thus, the answer is E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  To weaken the detective's argument, we need to find a statement that suggests or implies that the embezzler was an accountant, or undermines the detective's reasoning for concluding that the embezzler was an actuary.
  A, B, C, and D all provide possible explanations for the embezzlement that cast doubt on the detective's argument.
  E, however, does not weaken the detective's argument, as it suggests that the actuaries would have less access to financial records than the accountants, which supports the detective's conclusion that the embezzler is an actuary.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is based on the premise that the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records.
  The detective concludes that it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries because an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We are looking for the choice that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  A, B, C, and D all provide alternative explanations for the embezzlement or point to factors that suggest the detective's conclusion is less certain.
  Only E does not challenge the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  To weaken an argument means to show that the argument is not strong or that it has flaws.
  The detective's argument is that an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
  We need to find an option that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is the option that does not have any impact on the detective's argument.
  Option C is the most likely answer because it provides information about the number of accountants and actuaries in the company but does not weaken the detective's argument. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as an actuary.
  The detective's argument is based on the assumption that an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the option that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Options A, B, C, and E suggest reasons why the detective's argument may not necessarily be true.
  Option D is unrelated to the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries because an accountant would not have made the mistakes discovered in the ledger entries.
  Weaknesses in the detective's argument would be any information that contradicts or challenges this reasoning.
  A: If the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized than the accountants, this would support the argument that the embezzler is likely to be an actuary.
  B: If persons outside of the company had access to the internal financial records, this could mean that someone who was not an accountant or actuary embezzled the money, or that an accountant or actuary was coerced into participating in the embezzlement.
  C: The number of accountants and actuaries does not necessarily weaken the detective's argument.
  D: An independent report that concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement does not necessarily weaken the detective's argument.
  E: If certain security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, this would weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler is likely to be an actuary.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone.
  B: I have no reason to think that the practical joke I want to play would harm anyone. So, since the joke would show no contempt for the person the joke is played on, it would not be wrong for me to play it.
  C: Because of the circumstances, it would be wrong for me to play the practical joke I had intended to play on you. Even though it would not show contempt for anyone, it could easily bring you significant harm.
  D: It would have been wrong for me to play the practical joke that I had intended to play on you. Even though I did not have reason to think that it would significantly harm anyone, I did think that it would show contempt for someone.
  E: Someone was harmed as a result of my practical joke. Thus, even though it did not show contempt for the person I played the joke on, I should not have played it.
Response 0:
Thought:
The principle stated in the context is that one should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person. 
In option A, the person realizes that the practical joke would bring significant harm, so it supports the principle stated in the context.
In option B, the fact that the joke would not show contempt is not enough to justify the act if it might bring harm to someone.
In option C, the person acknowledges that the practical joke might bring significant harm to the other person, so the argument aligns with the principle stated in the context.
In option D, the person acknowledges that the practical joke would show contempt for someone, so it supports the principle stated.
In option E, the person acknowledges that someone was harmed as a result of the practical joke, which aligns with the principle.
Therefore, options A, C, D, and E are in line with the principle stated in the context.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The principle suggests that one should not play a practical joke if it shows contempt for someone or if it might harm the person.
  So, it would be wrong to play a practical joke on someone if it could bring significant harm to the person even if it is not contemptuous.
  Also, it would be wrong to play a practical joke that would show contempt for someone even if it wouldn't harm them.
Analysis:
  A: The argument affirms the principle that one should not play a practical joke on someone if it would bring significant harm to the person. Correct.
  B: The argument assumes that if there is no harm and no contempt, it would not be wrong to play the practical joke. Incorrect.
  C: The argument only mentions that playing the practical joke could bring significant harm to the person but does not refer to contempt. Incorrect.
  D: The argument affirms the principle that one should not play a practical joke that would show contempt for someone. Correct.
  E: The argument affirms the principle that one should not play a practical joke if someone would be harmed even if it is not contemptuous. Incorrect.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The principle states that playing a practical joke is not valid if it shows contempt to a person or might bring significant harm to that person.
  Option A: This option justifies the principle by stating that even if the joke is not contemptuous, it would be wrong to play it if it brings significant harm to someone.
  Option B: This option is not valid according to the principle as the harm that the joke might bring is not the only factor, but also whether the joke shows contempt for someone.
  Option C: This option justifies the principle by stating that even if the joke is not contemptuous, it would be wrong to play it if it brings significant harm to someone.
  Option D: This option justifies the principle by stating that it would be wrong to play a practical joke if it shows contempt for someone, even if it does not harm anyone.
  Option E: This option mentions that someone was harmed as a result of the practical joke, which aligns with the principle that the joke should not bring significant harm to anyone.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The principle states that one should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm.
  Choice A acknowledges the principle and applies it to a specific situation where the person believes the joke would bring significant harm.
  Choice B tries to use the principle to justify playing a practical joke on someone but does not consider whether it might bring significant harm.
  Choice C acknowledges the principle and applies it to a specific situation where the person believes the joke could easily bring significant harm.
  Choice D acknowledges the principle and applies it to a specific situation where the person believes the joke would show contempt for someone.
  Choice E acknowledges the principle and admits that even though the practical joke did not show contempt for the person, someone was still harmed as a result of it.
  Only choice A acknowledges the principle and applies it to a specific situation where the person failed to realize that the practical joke would bring significant harm.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The principle stated above says that one should not play a practical joke if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
  The argument that justifies this principle will consider these two factors.
  Options A, C, D, and E reference one or both of these factors.
  Option B only considers whether the joke would show contempt for the person the joke is played on.
  Therefore, the argument that justifies the principle is most similar to option A and D, which include one or both of the factors.
  Option A includes both factors, whereas option D only includes one of them.
  Therefore, option A best justifies the reasoning in the above principle.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:

  The principle stated in the question is that one should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
  The correct answer is the argument that follows the same principle.
  Option A admits that the principle is correct.
  Option B's argument is based on the assumption that the practical joke would not harm anyone, but the principle states that one should not play a practical joke if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
  Option C admits that it would be wrong to play the practical joke, even though it does not show contempt for anyone.
  Option D admits that it would have been wrong to play the practical joke because it would show contempt for someone.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film because it leads to greater revenues from ticket sales.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows because there could be other factors that determine the profitability of a television show.
  We need to find a statement that helps to explain why maximizing the number of viewers is not the primary goal of television executives.
  Option A talks about the number of times people watch a film or a show, which is not relevant to the primary goal.
  Option B talks about the difference in profits between movies and television, but it doesn't explain the primary goal.
  Option C is a possible explanation, since the cost of producing a film is much greater than the cost of producing a television show, it makes sense that they need to maximize the number of viewers to generate profits.
  Option D suggests that the purchasing power of viewers is more important for television executives, which is a different factor from the primary goal.
  Option E talks about popular television shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch, which could mean a different revenue model. However, this doesn't explain the primary goal of television executives.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

  Option A is irrelevant and does not explain the difference.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the main difference between the goals.
  Option C explains a difference but not the primary goal of TV executives.
  Option D is relevant and explains the difference between the goals.
  Option E does not explain the difference.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

Response 2:
Thought: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film because the revenue is generated from ticket sales.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers because they make money from sponsors, so they are more concerned with the purchasing power of the viewers.
  Choice A has no impact on the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Choice B talks about the difference in profits that owners of movie theaters make and is irrelevant to explaining the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  Choice C is also irrelevant.
  Choice D explains why television executives are more concerned with the purchasing power of the viewers and hence not interested in maximizing the number of viewers.

  Choice A is about people watching a film or television show more than once. It does not explain the difference in goals between the two types of executives.
  Choice B is about profits from the sale of refreshments in movie theaters. It is not relevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Choice C is about the cost of producing an hour of film versus an hour of television. It does not explain the difference in goals between the two types of executives.
  Choice D is about the source of profits for television shows. It helps explain the difference in goals between the two types of executives. Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. This implies that the primary goal of TV executives is to target a specific demographic that is attractive to advertisers.
  Choice E is about the popularity of television shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch. It does not explain the difference in goals between the two types of executives. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

  Option A is not relevant to the goals of television executives.
  Option B is about profits of movie theaters, not movie executives or television executives.
  Option C is not relevant to the goals of television executives.
  Option D is a possible reason as the purchasing power of the viewers is important to sponsors who provide profits to television shows, but this is not a strong reason for why television executives have different goals than movie executives.
  Option E is a possible reason for why television executives have different goals than movie executives as many popular television shows are free to watch and do not generate revenue directly from viewers.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

  Option B mentions the profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers, which is not relevant to the goals of movie executives and television executives.
  Option C mentions the cost of producing an hour of film versus producing an hour of television, which could be a factor in explaining the difference between the goals of movie executives and television executives.
  Option D mentions that the profits of television shows come from sponsors who are concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show, which could be a reason why the primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers.
  Option E does not help to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Option D provides the most relevant explanation for the difference in goals between movie executives and television executives.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Question: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The museum displays only twentieth-century works that are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
  Prints of all the latter works are available in the museum store.
  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  Therefore:
    A is incorrect because some prints in the museum store are not of works that are on loan to the museum or in the permanent collection.
    B is incorrect because the statement only refers to prints sold in the museum store and not all prints in the world.
    C is incorrect because the statement does not make a claim about prints of works that are on loan from a private collector but not displayed in the museum.
    D is incorrect because the statement does not indicate whether Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan from a private collector or not, only that it is not in the museum's permanent collection.
    The only statement that must be true based on the information provided is that Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum. Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  The works it displays are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
  Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  We can discard options (C), (D), and (E) because the statements in the question do not imply these options. 
  Option (B) is not correct because the statements do not say that only twentieth-century works are sold in the museum store.
  Option (A) must be true because the statements say that the prints of all of the museum's permanent collection works are available in the museum store.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The museum displays twentieth-century works.
  These works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
  Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  Therefore, not all prints in the museum store are from works on loan or part of the permanent collection.
  The curator only mentions that prints of "the latter works" are available in the museum store, so it is not clear if all prints in the museum store are from works on loan or part of the permanent collection.
  There is no information to suggest that every work displayed in the museum has prints available in the museum store.
  There is also no information to suggest that Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  However, we do know that Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum because it is not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is:
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  The works displayed in the museum are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
  Prints of every work in the museum's permanent collection are available in the museum store.
  Some works not in the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks, have prints available in the museum store.
  Therefore, every print in the museum store is not necessarily of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection (choice A is not necessarily true).
  The curator did not say that every print sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work (choice B could be true, but this is not necessary).
  Prints of every work displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector are not necessarily available in the museum store (choice C is not necessarily true).
  The curator did not say that Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan to the museum from a private collector (choice D is not true).
  The curator did not say whether or not Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum (choice E could be true, but this is not necessary).
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  There are prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  Prints of all of the museum's permanent collection works are available in the museum store.
  Not every print in the museum store is of works that are either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
  Therefore, the correct answer is either B or E.
  Choice B is not true because the curator's statements don't say that every print sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  Choice E is true because the curator's statements don't say that Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum.
Action: Answer("E")

  Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  Therefore, A and C cannot be true as they make broad generalizations that are not necessarily true.
  B may or may not be true, but it is not a necessary condition based on the information provided.
  D is not true as Hopper's Nighthawks is not on loan from a private collector.
  E seems to be a possible answer since we are not told whether Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum or not.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.

- Every print that is sold in the museum store is not necessarily a copy of a twentieth-century work, as some prints sold in the store may be of works from other centuries.
- There is no information to suggest that prints in the museum store are available for every work in the museum that is not on loan from a private collector.
- There is no information to suggest that Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
- There is no information on whether Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum.

  Some prints in the museum store are of works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  Only A, B, D, or E can be true.
  A cannot be true because some prints in the museum store are of works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B is true. All prints that are sold in the museum store are copies of twentieth-century works.
  D cannot be true. Hopper's Nighthawks is a twentieth-century work, but the curator did not mention that it is on loan from a private collector.
  E cannot be true. The curator did not say whether Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum.

  Therefore, every print in the museum store is a copy of a print that is either in the museum's permanent collection or on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  The curator did not state that every work in the museum is in the museum store, so it is not necessarily true that there are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  The curator did not state that Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan to the museum from a private collector, so it is not necessarily true that Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.

  Choice C is not necessarily true. It is possible that some works that are displayed in the museum and not on loan from private collectors are not available as prints in the museum store.
  Choice D is not necessarily true. The curator's statements do not provide information about whether Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan from a private collector.
  Choice E might be true or false, but it is not a conclusion that we can draw from the curator's statements.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.
Response 0:
Thought:
The principles state that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Option A and B describe a scenario where the person unwittingly brings about misfortune and could not have reasonably foreseen it. Therefore, they could use the principle to argue that they should not be blamed for it.
Option C and E describe a scenario where the person could have reasonably foreseen the misfortune. Therefore, the principles do not apply to these options.
Option D describes a scenario where the person unwittingly brings about misfortune but their actions were negligent. Therefore, the principles do not apply to this option.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The principles state that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if they could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Option A describes a situation where Riley parked his car in the center lane of Main Street and caused a traffic accident but did not foresee that it would cause an accident. This aligns with the principles.
  Option B describes a situation where Oblicek suggested a loan to her brother, which caused his business to go bankrupt but she had no idea that it would happen. This aligns with the principles.
  Option C describes a situation where Gougon served the hollandaise sauce to his guests, and it made them ill, but he was concerned that it might happen. This does not align with the principles.
  Option D describes a situation where Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, which caused the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure but he did not know that it would happen. This aligns with the principles.
  Option E describes a situation where Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves and started a fire on Rodriguez's farm, and any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. This does not align with the principles.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage mentions that "a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it." Therefore, the correct answer choice should be an instance where someone unwittingly brings about misfortune, but they could not have reasonably foreseen it.
Option A is a case where Riley could have foreseen that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident if he had thought about it. Therefore, A is incorrect.
Option B is a case where Oblicek had no idea that suggesting a loan to her brother would cause the business to go bankrupt, and she could not have reasonably foreseen this. Therefore, B is a valid answer choice.
Option C mentions that Gougon was concerned that serving hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, so he could have foreseen the misfortune. Therefore, C is incorrect.
Option D is a case where Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know that the wrong medicine would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore D is a valid answer choice.
Option E mentions that any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore E is incorrect.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if they could not have reasonably foreseen it.
  Option A uses a similar situation to the principle above.
  Option B uses a similar situation to the principle above.
  Option C does not follow the principle since Gougon was concerned that the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill.
  Option D does not follow the principle since Dr. Fitzpatrick gave the wrong medicine.
  Option E does not follow the principle since any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument presented in the context is that a person should not be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Option A presents an example of a person who did not realize the consequences of their action and thus, should not be blamed for it.
  Option B also presents a similar example of a person who had no idea that their actions would cause misfortune and could not have reasonably foreseen it.
  Option C presents a person who was concerned that their actions might cause misfortune, which indicates that they could have reasonably foreseen it.
  Option D presents an example of a person who did not know the consequences of their actions and hence, cannot be blamed unless someone else knowingly contributed to it.
  Option E presents an example where a reasonable person could have foreseen the consequences of the action, and thus, the person is to blame.
  Therefore, the reasoning that aligns with the given principles is presented in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The principles assert that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Choice A presents a similar situation where Riley unwittingly causes misfortune, but the misfortune was foreseeable. Therefore, Riley should be blamed for it.
  Choice B presents a situation where Oblicek is not to blame because she could not have reasonably foreseen the misfortune.
  Choice C presents a situation where Gougon could have reasonably foreseen the misfortune, so he should be blamed for it.
  Choice D presents a situation where Dr. Fitzpatrick is not to blame because he did not know that the medicine would cause the patient's increased blood pressure.
  Choice E presents a situation where Kapp could have reasonably foreseen the misfortune, so she should be blamed for it.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:

  The principle states that a person should not be blamed for misfortune if they could not have reasonably foreseen it.
  Choice A: Riley did not realize that parking in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident, so he should not be blamed if an accident does happen.
  Choice B: Oblicek could not have reasonably foreseen that suggesting a loan to her brother would bankrupt his business, so she should not be blamed if that happens.
  Choice C: Gougon was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, so he should be blamed if it does.
  Choice D: Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know that giving the patient the wrong medicine would cause an increase in blood pressure, so he should not be blamed if that happens.
  Choice E: Kapp should be blamed for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm because any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire.

  The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Choice A: If it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident, and he could not have reasonably foreseen that it would, he should not be blamed for it.
  Choice B: If Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, and she could not have reasonably foreseen this, she should not be blamed for it.
  Choice C: If Gougon was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, then he could have reasonably foreseen it. Thus, he should be blamed for it if the hollandaise sauce does make his guests ill.
  Choice D: If Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine and did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure, he should not be blamed for it since he could not have reasonably foreseen it.
  Choice E: Kapp could have reasonably foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore, she should be blamed for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.
  The reasoning in Choice B aligns with the principle stated.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Choice A presents a scenario where Riley did not think about the consequences of parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, so if a traffic accident occurs because of it, he should not be blamed for it. This aligns with the principle.
  Choice B presents a scenario where Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother to take out a loan could cause the business to go bankrupt, which she reasonably could not have foreseen. Therefore, if the loan does cause the business to go bankrupt, she should not be blamed for it. This aligns with the principle.
  Choice C presents a scenario where Gougon had no reason to think that serving hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Therefore, if the sauce does make his guests ill, he should be blamed for it. This goes against the principle.
  Choice D presents a scenario where Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know that the wrong medicine would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure, so if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the increase, only Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it. This aligns with the principle.
  Choice E presents a scenario where dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves could start a fire, which any reasonable person could have foreseen. Therefore, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there. This goes against the principle.
  Based on this analysis, the best answer is B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument claims that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because jurors without specialized knowledge are systematically excluded. To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that implies trial by jury is a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues even if jurors without specialized knowledge are involved. 
Option A states that issues that are more complicated make it harder for jurors without specialized knowledge to understand the testimony. This statement does not weaken the argument, as it reinforces the argument. 
Option B also does not weaken the argument, as it suggests that jurors with specialized knowledge may be biased. 
Option C is irrelevant to the argument, as it discusses the fairness of an impartial arbitrator and not the fairness of a trial by jury. 
Option D suggests that expert witnesses may be unreliable, which could suggest that jurors without specialized knowledge may have a valid opinion. 
Option E is also irrelevant to the argument, as it discusses the cost of expert witness services, not the fairness of a trial by jury. 
Therefore, the best answer is D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving issues on which jurors are excluded.
  The weakness in the argument can show that jurors with limited specialized knowledge can still make fair judgments.
  Choice A strengthens the argument by saying that jurors without specialized knowledge can have difficulty understanding the issue.
  Choice B strengthens the argument by saying that jurors with specialized knowledge can be prejudiced in favor of a party.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument and does not help to weaken it.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or B, which one weakens the argument more?
  Choice B is more likely to weaken the argument, as it indicates that jurors with specialized knowledge can be prejudiced, implying that it may be beneficial to have jurors without specialized knowledge. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries.
  To weaken the argument, we are looking for a statement that shows that trial by jury is still a fair way to settle disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D does not weaken the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice A, on the other hand, suggests that litigants with specialized knowledge may not be needed if the issue is explained clearly enough to the jury. This suggests that trial by jury is still a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
The argument claims that systematically excluding people with specialized knowledge from juries makes trials unfair for cases involving scientific or technical issues. To weaken this argument, we need a response that shows that excluding such jurors does not harm the fairness of jury trials. 
Choice A is plausible, but it reinforces the argument instead of weakening it. 
Choice B also reinforces the argument by stating that jurors with specialized knowledge may be biased, which would support removing them from the jury. 
Choice C is irrelevant because the argument is about trials by jury, not arbitration. 
Choice D is interesting, but it does not show how excluding specialized jurors from juries harm the fairness of the trial. 
Choice E is also irrelevant because it does not address the issue of excluding specialized jurors.
Therefore, none of the given options weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that juries are systematically excluding people with specialized knowledge and this makes the trial by jury unfair.
  We need to counter this claim by saying that the exclusion of people with specialized knowledge does not make the trial unfair.
  Option A states that jurors who do not have specialized knowledge may have a hard time understanding the issue. This supports the argument.
  Option B states that more knowledge about a scientific or technical issue may make jurors biased in favor of one of the parties, which is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C talks about appointing an impartial arbitrator, which is not the subject of this argument.
  Option D talks about how experts discuss the possibility of error, which is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E states that expert witnesses may charge high fees that many people cannot afford, which is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, Option B is the most likely answer that weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  The reason is because people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries.
  We need to find a choice that shows that trial by jury can still be a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
Analysis:
  A: This choice strengthens the argument by saying that jurors without specialized knowledge will not be able to comprehend the testimony. This makes the argument stronger.
  B: This choice is irrelevant because it talks about the jurors being prejudiced. Prejudice is not the same as lacking specialized knowledge.
  C: This choice is also irrelevant because it talks about appointing an impartial arbitrator. We are not discussing impartial arbitrators.
  D: This choice is also irrelevant because it talks about how experts hedge their conclusions. We are not discussing the experts themselves.
  E: This choice weakens the argument by suggesting that expert witnesses are expensive and cannot be afforded by many people involved in litigation. This means that the people on the jury can still have specialized knowledge, but they may not be expert witnesses. This weakens the argument that trials by jury are not fair.
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that jurors without specialized knowledge about scientific or technical issues are excluded from juries where that issue is relevant.
  This implies that trials where scientific or technical issues are relevant are not fair if jurors are not knowledgeable about the issues.
  I need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A states that the more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely a juror without specialized knowledge of the field will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  This option weakens the argument by showing that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony even if they are present in the jury.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries for trials involving relevant issues, making it unfair.
  We need to find an answer choice that weakens this argument. 
  Answer choice A supports the argument and does not weaken it.
  Answer choice B is irrelevant and does not weaken the argument.
  Answer choice C discusses the use of arbitrators and is irrelevant to the argument.
  Answer choice D is also irrelevant and does not weaken the argument.
  Answer choice E is the only option that weakens the argument as it suggests that expert witnesses may not be affordable to all parties involved in the litigation process, which may put some parties at a disadvantage.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that trial by jury is unfair in cases where specialized scientific or technical knowledge is required.
  A weakener would be a statement that shows that trial by jury can be fair even when specialized knowledge is required.
  Choice A suggests that jurors can understand complex issues even if they do not have specialized knowledge.
  Therefore, choice A weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that juries are not fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues as people with specialized knowledge in this field are excluded.
  To weaken the argument, we need to refute the given assumption that juries with no specialized knowledge cannot serve as a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Option A provides evidence to support the idea that juries without specialized knowledge may still be able to comprehend the testimony given which weakens the argument.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum comes from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  The argument is contradicted by scientists who believe petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits.
  The geologist counters this by arguing biomarkers are present in petroleum.
  We need to find an answer that weakens the geologist's argument.
  Answer choice A does not weaken the argument. It is irrelevant to the argument.
  Answer choice B also does not weaken the argument. It is also irrelevant.
  Answer choice C actually supports the geologist's argument. It does not weaken the argument.
  Answer choice D is a new piece of information that does not weaken the geologist's argument.
  Answer choice E, however, weakens the argument since it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants - which is precisely the geologist's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The geologist's argument is that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum proves that petroleum was formed from living organisms.
  If there are cases where fossils are devoid of biomarkers, then this weakens the argument that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum proves that it was formed from living organisms.
  Therefore, the answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum confirms that it originated from the fossilized remains of living organisms.
  To weaken this argument, we need to show that the presence of biomarkers does not necessarily indicate the presence of living organisms.
  Choice A does not address the argument directly.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the geologist's argument.
  Choice D does not address the argument directly.
  Choice E weakens the geologist's argument by suggesting an alternative source of petroleum.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum indicates that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  The theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth is refuted by the presence of biomarkers.
  We are looking for an answer choice that weakens this argument.
  If biomarkers could be present without petroleum forming from the fossilized remains of plants and animals, then the geologist's argument would be weakened.
  Answer A weakens the argument by suggesting that biomarkers do not always indicate the presence of a living organism.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the view that it formed from the fossilized remains of plants or animals, rather than from deep carbon deposits.
To weaken the geologist's argument, we need to find an alternative explanation for the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
Option A suggests that fossils exist without biomarkers, but this does not refute the geologist's argument that biomarkers are present in petroleum.
Option B is irrelevant, as it does not address the formation of petroleum or the presence of biomarkers.
Option C strengthens the geologist's argument by suggesting that the formation of petroleum from living material would take a long time.
Option D is also irrelevant since it does not relate to the formation of petroleum.
Option E provides an alternative explanation for the presence of biomarkers in petroleum, thus weakening the geologist's argument. If some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, then the presence of biomarkers in petroleum could be explained by this, rather than solely by the breakdown of living organisms.
 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum comes from fossils that contain biomarkers.
  Some scientists disagree and think petroleum comes from carbon deposits.
  The geologist's argument is weakened if there are other possible ways for biomarkers to be present in petroleum besides the existence of living organisms.
  A, B, and D all do not weaken the geologist's argument.
  C is not relevant to the argument because the speed of the process is not important.
  E is the only option left that could weaken the geologist's argument.
  If some carbon deposits were indeed formed from the fossilized remains of plants, then biomarkers could come from those deposits and not necessarily from living organisms.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that petroleum must have been formed from living organisms because of the presence of biomarkers.
  We need to find a statement that contradicts or weakens the idea that biomarkers are always present in petroleum.
  Choice A, B, C, and D does not address or contradict the argument about biomarkers.
  Choice E suggests that some carbon deposits can be formed from the fossilized remains of plants. If this is true, then it is possible for petroleum to form from non-living material.
  Therefore, E weakens the geologist's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The geologist claims that petroleum is formed from fossilized remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.
  The opponents argue that petroleum is formed from carbon deposited during the formation of the earth.
  The presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the geologist's argument.
  The question asks which option weakens the geologist's argument the most.
  Option A, B, C, and D do not weaken the geologist's argument.
  Option E suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
  If true, E would imply that the geologist's argument could be correct.
  Option E weakens the opponent's argument and undermines their claim.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that petroleum must have formed from fossilized remains of plants and animals because biomarkers are present in petroleum.
  To weaken this argument, we need to provide an alternative explanation for the presence of biomarkers.
  Choice A, B, C, D do not provide an alternative explanation for the biomarkers.
  Choice E suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which supports the geologist's argument.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A since it suggests a scenario where fossils do not have biomarkers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum indicates that it is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  We need to weaken this argument.
  To weaken this argument, we need to provide an alternative explanation for the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B does not provide any information about petroleum formation.
  Choice C actually strengthens the geologist's argument.
  Choice D doesn't provide any explanation for the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  Choice E is the only one that provides an alternative explanation for the presence of biomarkers in petroleum, as it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The student argues that people have an immunity to Staphylococcus since many are exposed without harmful symptoms.
  However, this argument ignores the possibility that some people are simply not susceptible to Staphylococcus.
  This pattern of reasoning is similar to option C, where it is assumed that Isabel did not take medication because she is still ill, ignoring the possibility that the medication might not have worked for her.
  Therefore, the answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The student's argument is that if many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, then they have immunity to the microorganism.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning seems to be that the student states that the absence of harmful symptoms implies immunity to the microorganism, but it is not necessarily true.
  Choice A is a similar pattern of reasoning where the absence of just actions implies that they do not serve the interests of everyone.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms, they have an immunity to it.
  This is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms implies immunity.
  Choice A is similar in that it assumes that everything morally right serves the interests of everyone, which is not necessarily true.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The student claims that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, and therefore, they have immunity to staphylococcus.
  This argument ignores the possibility that there may be other reasons why people do not develop any harmful symptoms.
  It assumes that the only reason people do not develop any harmful symptoms is that they have immunity to staphylococcus.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to (C) Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The student assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This assumption may not be true since some people may be asymptomatic for other reasons.
  The argument is similar in pattern to answer choice C which assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning since medication may not work for everyone or in every case.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The student assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms must mean immunity to the microorganism.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning.
  To identify a flawed pattern of reasoning that is most similar to the student's argument, we need to look for a choice that also makes an unwarranted assumption.
  Choice E seems to assume that the frequency in which doctors wash their hands is directly proportional to the effectiveness of the procedure in preventing disease, which is unwarranted.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: The student argues that because many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. However, this argument is flawed because it assumes that people who are not harmed by the microorganism must be immune to it, which is not true. 
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in this argument is most similar to option C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill. This argument assumes that medication must work and cure or alleviate the symptoms of a disease, which is not necessarily true. Similarly, the student's argument assumes that not developing harmful symptoms from staphylococcus means having immunity to it. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, they have immunity to it. However, this argument is flawed because exposure does not necessarily mean immunity.
  Option A is a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the fallacy of the undistributed middle, where the middle term is undistributed in the premises, but is distributed in the conclusion. This is different from the student's flawed reasoning.
  Option B is a flawed pattern of reasoning known as a sweeping generalization, where a generalization is made based on insufficient evidence. This is different from the student's flawed reasoning.
  Option C is a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the false dilemma, where only two options are presented, when in fact there may be more options. This is different from the student's flawed reasoning.
  Option D is a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the post hoc fallacy, where a correlation is assumed to imply causation. This is different from the student's flawed reasoning.
  Option E is a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the hasty generalization, where a generalization is made based on a small or unrepresentative sample. This is similar to the student's flawed reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 8:
Thought:
The student argues that since many people have been exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have immunity to the microorganism. However, this conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. Therefore, the pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is flawed.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The student's argument concludes that people have an immunity to staphylococcus because many people who are exposed to the microorganism do not develop harmful symptoms.
  The argument assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is necessarily a sign of immunity, which is not always the case.
  Therefore, the student's argument is flawed in reasoning.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the physician's critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
  The argument assumes that the physician's employment by the company makes him biased.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it takes for granted that anyone associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  The answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
  The reason for the argument is that the physician who critiqued the book is employed by the drug company that manufactures the drug, and therefore, may have personal reasons to deny the drug's danger.
  This reasoning assumes that anyone associated with a drug company cannot be impartial.
  Therefore, the journalist's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it takes for granted that anyone associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to weigh evidence fairly concerning the drug's side effects.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the critique from the physician who is employed by the drug manufacturing company is biased against the book's claims. 
  The claim is not entirely true.
  The argument assumes that the physician is not capable of making an unbiased assessment.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it takes for granted that anyone remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The journalist claimed that the physician's critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
  The journalist reasoned that the physician's employer manufactures the drug and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
  However, the journalist's argument is vulnerable to criticism.
  The question is asking for the most vulnerable criticism of the journalist's argument.
  Choice A is not relevant and does not address the argument.
  Choice B is relevant to the argument but does not criticize it.
  Choice C is not relevant as it does not address the argument.
  Choice D is the most vulnerable criticism of the journalist's argument. The argument assumes that the physician's critique is not legitimate because he is employed by the company that manufactures the drug. However, this assumption is not always true. Someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may still provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim. Therefore, the journalist's argument is weak.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book by a physician who is employed by the company that manufactures the drug is not legitimate.
  The journalist assumes that the physician is biased and unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning the drug's side effects.
  The journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  Therefore, the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book by a physician employed by the drug manufacturer lacks legitimacy because the physician may have personal reasons to deny the drug's dangerous side effects.
  This argument assumes that the physician's employment with the drug manufacturer makes them biased and unable to weigh evidence fairly.
  However, it is not always the case that someone with personal reasons to deny a claim is biased and unable to provide legitimate grounds for denying the claim.
  Therefore, the journalist's argument may be vulnerable to criticism for not addressing the possibility that someone with personal reasons to deny a claim may still provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  The answer is D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The journalist argues that the critique of a book claiming that a drug has dangerous side effects is not legitimate because the physician criticizing the book is employed by the manufacturer of the drug.
  The argument assumes that the physician is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of the drug.
  This assumption is questionable, and the argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes for granted that the physician is unable to provide legitimate grounds for denying the book's claims.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The journalist claims that the physician's critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
  The reason given is that the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
  Therefore, the journalist's argument can be criticized if it fails to address the possibility that the physician's critique could still be legitimate despite having personal reasons to deny the drug is dangerous.
  Choice A is out of scope because it talks about other claims made in the book.
  Choice B can be a possible criticism because it questions the journalist's assumption that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug. 
  Choice C is irrelevant to the journalist's argument.
  Choice D seems to be the opposite of the journalist's argument and can't be a potential criticism of it.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the journalist's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the critique of a physician can be dismissed because of the physician's employment with the company that produces the drug.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it assumes that the physician's employment with the company automatically discredits their opinion.
  Answer B suggests this criticism most directly.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects, because the physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug and probably has personal reasons to deny the drug's dangerous side effects.
  The argument might be vulnerable to criticism.
  The argument could be criticized if it fails to address the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  Choice A correctly expresses this criticism.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The conflict presented is that the evolution of the human brain was crucially dependent on a high-calorie diet with adequate fats found in shore environments, but the evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find an answer that explains why the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas rather than shore environments despite the abundance of high-calorie food resources.
  Choice A does not explain the apparent conflict.
  Choice B is not relevant to the conflict presented.
  Choice C does not explain why early humans did not evolve in shore environments despite the availability of high-calorie food resources.
  Choice D is also not relevant to the conflict presented.
  Choice E potentially explains the apparent conflict by suggesting that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The conflict is that the high-calorie diet needed for the evolution of the human brain was most abundant in shore environments, yet the evolution of the human brain took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find an option that explains why the shore environment was not the primary site for the evolution of the human brain.
  Option A talks about the metabolic rate of early humans, which is irrelevant to the situation.
  Option B talks about the size of the brain, which is also irrelevant to the situation.
  Option C talks about the reliability of resources which may explain the situation, but it does not directly relate to the evolution of the human brain.
  Option D talks about the techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites, which is irrelevant to the situation.
  Option E explains why gathering food in other environments was more efficient and required fewer calories.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The conflict presented above is that early humans needed a high calorie diet with adequate fats to evolve the anatomically modern human brain, but such resources were most available in shore environments, yet their brain evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  Option A talks about metabolic rate, which does not address the conflict.
  Option B talks about the size of the human brain, which also does not directly address the conflict.
  Option C suggests that the resources in savanna and woodland areas were more reliable and abundant in prehistoric times than they are today, but it's unclear how relevant that is to the conflict presented above.
  Option D is also not relevant because it talks about the techniques used to explore archaeology, which is not related to the conflict.
  Option E talks about calorie expenditure, which could help explain why early humans did not evolve their brain in shoreline environments.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The question asks for the option that would help resolve the apparent conflict.
  The conflict is that humans evolved in savanna and woodland areas but the high-calorie diet they needed was most abundant in shore environments.
  Option A may explain how humans were able to survive with a high-calorie diet in savanna and woodland areas.
  Option B provides information about the difference in brain size between early humans and anatomically modern humans, but it does not help resolve the conflict.
  Option C suggests that savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources in prehistoric times, which may be a possible explanation for why early humans evolved in those areas.
  Option D is irrelevant to the apparent conflict.
  Option E suggests that gathering food in shore environments required more calories, which does not help to resolve the conflict.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The conflict presented above is that the high-calorie diet providing adequate fats required for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain was most abundant and reliable in the shore environments, but the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  One possible explanation is that shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did other environments.
  Therefore, if E is true, it could help resolve the apparent conflict presented above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
The passage states that the shore environments were the most abundant and reliable sources of food for the early humans, but the brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas. To resolve this conflict, we need to find a logical reason why the brain evolved in savanna and woodland areas despite the abundance of food in shore environments.
Option A talks about the metabolic rate of early humans, which is irrelevant to the conflict presented.
Option B talks about the size of the earliest known humans, which is not related to the evolution of the brain in different environments.
Option C directly contradicts the passage, which states that food resources were more abundant and reliable in the shore environments during early human times.
Option D is irrelevant to the issue presented in the passage.
Option E suggests that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly higher expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. Therefore, this option could best resolve the apparent conflict presented in the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The conflict presented is that the abundant and reliable food resources for a high-calorie diet were found in shore environments, but the evolution of the human brain took place in savanna and woodland areas. 
  Option E offers an explanation for why early humans did not evolve their brains in shore environments even though the food there was suitable for their diet.
  Options A, B, C, and D are not relevant to the conflict presented above.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument presents a seeming conflict between the abundance of food resources that could support adequate fats for the evolution of the human brain and the fact that the evolution of the human brain took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve the conflict, we need a statement that can explain why savanna and woodland areas were more suitable for the evolution of the human brain than shore environments despite the abundance of food resources for a high-calorie diet in shore environments.
  Option B, which talks about the size of the earliest known humans’ brains, is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D, which talks about the techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites, is also irrelevant.
  Option A and E both provide information about the amount of calories expended by early humans in different environments. However, neither option explains why savanna and woodland areas were more suitable for the evolution of the human brain than shore environments.
  Option C suggests that prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today. If this is true, it could explain why early humans were more likely to live and evolve in savanna and woodland areas. Thus, C is the most appropriate answer for resolving the conflict presented in the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The apparent conflict is that high-calorie diets were most abundant and reliable in shore environments, but the evolution of the human brain took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find a statement that clarifies why high-calorie diets in shore environments did not contribute much to the evolution of the human brain.
  Choice A, B, D do not address this conflict. 
  Choice C does not clarify why high-calorie diets in shore environments did not contribute much to the evolution of the human brain.
  Choice E explains that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. This may explain why high-calorie diets in shore environments did not contribute much to the evolution of the human brain.
  Thus, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The conflict presented is that adequate food resources for a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats were most abundant and reliable in shore environments, but the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  The correct answer should help to explain why early humans were still able to evolve their brain despite not getting adequate food resources.
  Option A talks about the metabolic rate of early humans, but it does not help resolve the conflict.
  Option B mentions the brain size of early humans, but it does not help resolve the conflict.
  Option C is a possible explanation for why early humans were able to evolve their brain despite not getting adequate food resources. If prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today, then early humans could have obtained sufficient food resources from these areas.
  Option D is irrelevant to the conflict presented.
  Option E implies that gathering food in shore environments was less efficient than gathering food in other environments. This option, therefore, does not help resolve the conflict.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.

Topic: Law
Context: Principle: Employees of telemarketing agencies should never do anything that predisposes people to dislike the agencies' clients. Application: If an employee of a telemarketing agency has been told by a person the employee has called that he or she does not want to buy the product of a client of the agency, the employee should
Question: Which one of the following, if true, justifies the given application of the principle above?
Choices:
  A: Any employee of a telemarketing agency is likely to be able to detennine whether trying to talk someone into buying the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will likely engender nimosity toward the client.
  B: Some employees oftelemarketing agencies are unlikely to be certain about whether trying to talk someone into buying the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will likely engenderanimosity toward the client.
  C: Any employee of a telemarketing agency who tries to get someone to buy the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will engender animosity toward the client.
  D: Some people that an employee of a telemarketing agency calls to ask them to buy the product of a client of the agency will refuse to do so even though they are not predisposed to dislike the client.
  E: People who are already predisposed to dislike the client of a te1emarketiug agency are more likely to refuse to buy the product of that client than are people who are predisposed to like the client.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The principle states that telemarketing employees should not do anything that makes people dislike their clients.
  The application of the principle is in a scenario where a person does not want to buy a product from the client.
  The question asks us to identify which choice justifies the given application of the principle.
  Choice A talks about an employee's ability to determine whether talking someone into buying a product will engender animosity, and this is not related to the scenario.
  Choice B talks about some employees being unsure, but this does not justify the application of the principle.
  Choice C states that an employee who tries to get someone to buy a product after they have said no will engender animosity, which justifies the application of the principle.
  Choice D is not related to the scenario.
  Choice E talks about people predisposed to dislike a client being less likely to buy the product, but this is also not related to the scenario.
  Therefore, choice C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The principle states that employees of telemarketing agencies should never do anything that predisposes people to dislike the agencies' clients.
  The application states that if an employee of a telemarketing agency has been told by a person the employee has called that he or she does not want to buy the product of a client of the agency, the employee should do something that does not engender animosity toward the client.
  We need to find a statement that justifies the given application of the principle.
  Option A does not justify the given application of the principle since it does not mention anything about engendering animosity toward the client.
  Option B does not justify the given application of the principle since it says that "some" employees are not certain about engendering animosity, but not all.
  Option C justifies the given application of the principle since it states that any employee who tries to get someone to buy the product of a client after the person has said no will engender animosity toward the client.
  Option D does not justify the given application since it talks about people who refuse to buy not people who are predisposed to dislike the client.
  Option E does not justify the given application since it talks about predisposition to like or dislike, but not about what the employees should do.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Any employee of a telemarketing agency who tries to get someone to buy the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will engender animosity toward the client. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The principle states that employees of telemarketing agencies should never do anything that predisposes people to dislike the agencies' clients.
  The application states that if a person says they do not want to buy the product of a client, the employee should not try to talk them into it.
  The best answer would provide a reason why the application aligns with the principle.
  Answer C provides a direct reason why the employee should not try to talk someone into buying the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to. Therefore, Answer C is the correct choice.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The given principle states that employees of telemarketing agencies should never do anything that predisposes people to dislike the agencies' clients.
  The given application states that if a person has told the employee that he or she does not want to buy the product of a client of the agency, the employee should not try to talk that person into buying the product of that client.
  Choice A is irrelevant, as it talks about the ability of an employee to determine whether trying to convince someone will engender animosity.
  Choice B is irrelevant, as it talks about the uncertainty of some employees about whether trying to convince someone will engender animosity.
  Choice C aligns with the given application since it directly states that trying to convince someone after being told not to will engender animosity.
  Choices D and E are irrelevant as they do not justify the given application.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Any employee of a telemarketing agency who tries to get someone to buy the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will engender animosity toward the client.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The principle states that employees of telemarketing agencies should never do anything that predisposes people to dislike the agencies' clients.
  The application is about an employee of a telemarketing agency who has been told by a person the employee has called that he or she does not want to buy the product of a client of the agency.
  The question is asking which option justifies the given application of the principle.
  Option A talks about the employee's ability to discern whether trying to talk someone into buying the product of the client will engender animosity, but this does not justify the given application of the principle.
  Option B talks about some employees being uncertain about whether trying to talk someone into buying the product of the client will engender animosity, but this does not justify the given application of the principle.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The principle states that telemarketers should not do anything that predisposes people to dislike the client.
  The application states that if a person has said they do not want to buy the client's product, the employee should not try to convince them.
  The justification should explain why this application follows from the principle.
  Option A and B are discussing the employee's ability to determine whether to try to convince the person or not, and are therefore irrelevant to the justification.
  Option C states that trying to convince the person would predispose them to dislike the client, which justifies the application.
  Option D talks about people who refuse to buy the product, but it does not address the justification.
  Option E is irrelevant to the justification.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The principle states that employees of telemarketing agencies should not do anything that predisposes people to dislike their clients.
  The application of this principle is that if a person has told an employee that they do not want to buy the product, the employee should not try to persuade them.
  The justification for the application would be a statement that suggests trying to persuade someone who has already said they do not want to buy the product would predispose them to dislike the client.
  Option C states that trying to get someone to buy the product after they have said no will engender animosity toward the client. This justifies the given application.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The principle states that employees of telemarketing agencies should not do anything that predisposes people to dislike the agencies' clients.
The application states that if a person does not want to buy the product of a client, the employee should not try to talk them into it to avoid making them dislike the client.
The answer choice that justifies this application is the one that agrees with the application and is consistent with the principle.
Option C agrees with the application and is consistent with the principle.
Option A and B talk about the ability of the employee to determine the likelihood of people disliking the client, which is not relevant to the application.
Option D and E are unrelated to the application and the principle.
Therefore, the answer is C: Any employee of a telemarketing agency who tries to get someone to buy the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will engender animosity toward the client.
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The study found that office workers who report the least control over their own work have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome than those who report the most control.
  We need to find an answer that best explains this correlation.
  Answer choice A does not support the correlation between control over work and carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Answer choice B suggests a possible explanation of the correlation which states that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  Answer choice C refers to the keyboards and the position of the typists' arms and hands but it does not relate to the correlation between control over work and carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Answer choice D refers to office workers who rarely use keyboards, which is not relevant to the study.
  Answer choice E refers to other repetitive motions that office workers with the most control over their own work tend to perform more often than those with the least control, but it does not support the correlation between control over work and carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The study found that workers with the least control over their own work have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome compared to those with the most control.
  We are looking for an answer choice that best explains this finding.
  Answer choice A, C, D, and E are irrelevant to the study's findings.
  Answer choice B suggests the lack of control puts one under emotional stress which makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders, which could explain the study's findings.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The study found that office workers with the least control over their work have a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  The correct answer should provide an explanation for the study's findings.
  Choice A is irrelevant to why workers with the least control had a higher risk.
  Choice B can be a possible explanation.
  Choice C is not related to the study's findings.
  Choice D is irrelevant since the question is about office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  Choice E could be an alternate explanation.
  Between B and E, B is a more direct explanation for the study's findings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome compared to those who reported the most control.
  We need to select an answer choice that explains the study's findings. 
  Answer choice A and D discuss office workers who do not type often, so they do not explain the study's findings.
  Answer choice C discusses the keyboards used by office workers but does not explain why workers who report the least control over their work develop CTS more often.
  Answer choice B is plausible as stress can cause employees to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. However, it does not directly explain why workers who have less control over their work have a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Answer choice E is plausible as it suggests that employees who have more control over their work are less likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome because they perform repetitive motions other than typing more often.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The study found that office workers reporting the least control over their work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome compared to those reporting the most control.
  We need to find an option that explains the relationship between control over work and carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument and doesn't explain the relationship between control over work and carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option B talks about emotional stress and nerve disorders but doesn't explain how control over work affects carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option C suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, but it doesn't explain the relationship between control over work and the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument since it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards.
  Option E explains that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.
  If office workers with more control use keyboards less and perform other repetitive motions more often, they would have a lower risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Therefore, option E most helps to explain the study's findings.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The study found that workers with the least control over their work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  We need to find an option that explains why control over one's work is related to carpal tunnel syndrome risk.
  Option A talks about the amount of typing and not control.
  Option B talks about emotional stress and nerve disorders but does not explain the relationship with control.
  Option C talks about keyboards and carpal tunnel syndrome, but does not talk about control.
  Option D talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards, and that's not relevant to the study.
  Option E talks about the other repetitive motions that office workers perform. It is possible that workers with more control can work in a way that reduces the repetitive motion, which can reduce the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Therefore, Option E best explains the study's findings.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The study found that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome compared to those who reported the most control.
  We need to find an answer choice that explains the study's findings.
  Answer choice A is not relevant because we are only concerned with office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  Answer choice B may be true, but it does not necessarily explain the link between control over work and carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Answer choice C is also not relevant since the study already implicates typing on keyboards as a cause of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Answer choice D is not useful since it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards.
  Answer choice E provides an explanation that office workers with more control over their work perform repetitive motions other than typing more often which implies that their hands are exposed to less repetitive strain.
  Hence, the answer is E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The study found that workers with the least control over their work have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome than those who have the most control.
  We need to find an option that explains why those who have the least control are more prone to develop carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option A doesn't explain why workers who have the least control over their work are more prone to develop carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option B is plausible. Feeling a lack of control over one's work can put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  Option C suggests that keyboards are a cause of carpal tunnel syndrome, but the study focuses on workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  Option D is irrelevant to the study because it's about office workers who rarely use keyboards, and the study focuses on workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  Option E suggests that office workers with the most control over their work perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their work, which could mean that they don't spend as much time typing as those with the least control over their work.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The study found that workers with the least control over their work have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  We need to explain why having control over their work would reduce the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option B suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This can explain why workers who have less control over their work are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Feeling a lack of control over one's work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
The study found that workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control. Therefore, the correct answer needs to explain why workers who report lower control have a higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.
A: If office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work, it would suggest that the amount of typing is not the major reason for the difference in risk of carpal tunnel syndrome between the two groups. Hence, this option is incorrect.
B: If feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders, then this could explain the difference in risk of carpal tunnel syndrome between the two groups. This option is plausible and could be the correct answer.
C: If the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, then this could be a reason for the difference in risk of carpal tunnel syndrome between the two groups. This option also seems plausible.
D: This option is irrelevant to the study as it talks about office workers who rarely use keyboards.
E: If office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work, then this would suggest that typing may not be the main cause of the difference in risk of carpal tunnel syndrome between the two groups. Hence, this option is incorrect.
 
Option B and C seem plausible, however, option B seems to be more relevant to the study as it offers an explanation for the difference in risk of carpal tunnel syndrome between the two groups.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous, despite the fact that this drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy indicated above?
Choices:
  A: The drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available.
  B: The drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low.
  C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
  D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
  E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The antidote for chicken pox is effective at limiting the duration and severity of the disease, but its widespread use could be dangerous.
  The question asks for the choice that helps to reconcile this discrepancy.
  Choice A is unrelated to the issue at hand.
  Choice B is also unrelated to the issue at hand.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the issue at hand. The researchers are discussing the drug's effects within the body of the person taking it, not how well it prevents contagion to others.
  Choice D is plausible because it suggests a possible danger associated with the drug.
  Choice E is also plausible because it suggests that the drug could actually make the disease worse in the long run.
  Between D and E, D is the choice that most directly addresses the discrepancy mentioned in the question stem.
  Therefore, the answer is D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The researchers warn that the widespread use of the antidote could be dangerous, despite the fact that it has no serious side effects and is currently very effective.
  To reconcile this, we need to find a reason why widespread use could be dangerous.
  Option A talks about the drug's availability and does not address its potential danger.
  Option B talks about patient compliance, but it is not a reason why the antidote's widespread use could be dangerous.
  Option C states that the drug does not prevent the spread of chickenpox from one person to another. However, the question only talks about the duration and severity of chickenpox, not its spread. So, this option does not help to reconcile the discrepancy.
  Option D provides a reason why widespread use could be dangerous. It states that the drug can be fatal when misused.
  Option E talks about the development of deadlier forms of chickenpox that are resistant to the drug, but the passage does not mention this danger. So, this option cannot help to reconcile the discrepancy.
  Therefore, the answer is D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The antidote is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chickenpox.
  Researchers warn that the widespread use could be dangerous.
  The apparent discrepancy could be reconciled if there was a significant drawback to using the antidote.
  Option A does not explain the discrepancy.
  Option B does not explain the discrepancy.
  Option C also does not explain the discrepancy.
  Option D may explain that the drug is dangerous, but it does not explain why its widespread use could be dangerous despite no serious side effects.
  Option E, on the other hand, explains that the widespread use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chickenpox that are resistant to the drug. Therefore, the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous despite its effectiveness at limiting the duration and severity of chickenpox.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The antidote is developed for chicken pox, but its widespread use could be dangerous.
  However, the drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  To reconcile the above discrepancy, we need to find an option that provides a reason why the antidote might still be dangerous even with its effectiveness.
  Option A, B, D, and E do not provide any reason why the antidote could be dangerous despite its effectiveness.
  Option C provides a reason why the drug could still be dangerous. If the drug does not prevent the spread of chickenpox, then it could still be dangerous despite its effectiveness at limiting duration and severity.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The antidote for chicken pox is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  However, researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  We need to find a choice that can explain why the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous and also why the drug is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  Choice A provides a reason why the drug may not be widely available, but it does not reconcile the discrepancy.
  Choice B might explain why the drug is not effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox, but it does not reconcile the discrepancy.
  Choice C provides a reason why the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous, but it does not reconcile the discrepancy.
  Choice D provides a reason why the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous, but it does not explain why the drug is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  Choice E is not relevant to the discrepancy.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.

Thought: 
  The antidote for chickenpox has no serious side effects and is effective in limiting the duration and severity of chickenpox.
  However, researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  We need to find a statement that resolves this discrepancy.
  Option A and B don't explain the potential danger of the widespread use of the drug.
  Option D suggests that the drug can be dangerous if misused and not by its widespread use.
  Option E suggests that widespread use of the drug can lead to deadlier forms of chickenpox that are resistant to the drug, which supports the researchers' warning.
  Option C suggests that the drug does not prevent the spread of chickenpox from one person to another, but it doesn't explain the danger of its widespread use.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chickenpox that are resistant to the drug.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
   The antidote for chicken pox has no serious side effects and is very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox. 
   However, researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
   We need a statement that explains why the antidote, despite being effective, could be dangerous.
   Among the answer choices, only option C is relevant in explaining why the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous. 
   If the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person, then many people would still contract chicken pox from others, which could make the disease difficult to control.
   Therefore, the answer is C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The widespread use of the drug could be dangerous despite its effectiveness and lack of serious side effects.
  To reconcile this discrepancy, we need to find an answer that would explain why the drug's widespread use is dangerous.
  Option A suggests that the drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available. However, it doesn't explain why the drug's use is dangerous.
  Option B suggests that the drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low. However, it doesn't explain why the drug's use is dangerous.
  Option C suggests that the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person. While this may contribute to the danger of using the drug, it doesn't fully explain the apparent discrepancy.
  Option D suggests that the drug can be fatal when misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses. This fully explains the apparent discrepancy - widespread use of the drug could be dangerous because there is a risk of fatal overdose when patients take more than the prescribed dosage.
  Option E suggests that the use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug. While this may be a reason to limit the use of the drug, it doesn't fully explain the apparent discrepancy.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The antidote is effective at limiting the duration and severity of chickenpox.
  Researchers warn that the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous.
  We need to find out what would help to reconcile the discrepancy between these two facts.
  Option A and B do not explain the potential danger of the drug.
  Option D says that the drug can be fatal when misused, but it does not explain why its widespread use could be dangerous.
  Option E suggests that the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chickenpox.
  Option C explains why the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous because the drug does not prevent the spread of chickenpox from one person to another.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chickenpox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  An antidote for chickenpox exists.
  The drug is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chickenpox.
  However, researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  The reason for this discrepancy needs to be reconciled.
  Only the answer choice that provides a reason for the apparent contradiction will reconcile the discrepancy between the statement and the warning.
  Answer choice C provides a reason for the apparent contradiction.
  If the drug does not prevent the spread of chickenpox, even when it cures the disease in the first person, then widespread use could actually increase the spread of the disease.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning where Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. However, the concert did not sell out. Therefore, it was probably not properly promoted.
  Choice A presents a similar pattern of reasoning where Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. However, the patient did not survive the surgery. Therefore, it was probably not properly performed.
  The argument and Choice A both present a pattern of reasoning where a knowledgeable expert made a prediction. However, the outcome was different from the prediction. Therefore, the conclusion is that something went wrong. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
The argument provides a premise that the concert was not properly promoted, which supports the conclusion that the concert did not sell out.
Similarly, the correct answer should have a pattern of reasoning where a premise leads to a conclusion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that the concert was probably not properly promoted because it did not sell out. 
  Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, believed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  Therefore, the argument involves reasoning based on the knowledge of an expert.
  Option B involves similar reasoning where Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, believes that the sample probably does not contain organic compounds.
  If the sample was labeled correctly, it would contain organic compounds, but since it probably does not contain organic compounds, the sample is probably not labeled correctly.
  Therefore, the pattern of reasoning in option B is most similar to the argument above.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that the concert was probably not properly promoted because it did not sell out.
  The evidence for this conclusion is that Wells, who has knowledge about the concert business, was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  Similar reasoning can be seen in (A) where Dr. Smith concludes that the heart transplant was not properly performed because the patient did not survive.
  The evidence for this conclusion is that the patient would have probably survived the heart transplant had it been performed properly by a highly skilled surgeon.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument in the context is that Wells was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted, but it did not sell out. Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  The reasoning in option A is that Dr. Smith said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  The reasoning in option B is that Professor Willis said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  The reasoning in option C is that my neighbor said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Since one can still notice the damage, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done.
  The reasoning in option D is that the builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. Since the roof is already leaking, the builder was probably wrong.
  The reasoning in option E is that Professor Yanakita said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. Since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.
  The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above is option C. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that the concert was probably not properly promoted based on the fact that Wells - someone knowledgeable about the concert business - was certain it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted, and the concert did not sell out.
  (A) concludes that the heart transplant was probably not properly performed since Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon, and the patient did not survive the surgery.
  (B) concludes that the sample is probably not labeled correctly since Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds.
  (C) concludes that the repair to the wall was probably not properly done since the neighbor, an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired, and one can still notice the damage.
  (D) concludes that the builder was probably wrong since the school's roof is already leaking, but the builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm.
  (E) concludes that the tests were probably properly conducted since Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted, and the tests did find lead in the soil.
  The argument that is most similar to the pattern in the given argument is (A), which concludes that something was not done properly based on the fact that an expert said that it would probably be successful if done properly, but it was not successful. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument presents an expert's opinion, Wells', who said the concert would sell out unless poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out, implying poor promotion may have occurred.
  Option A is similar because it presents an expert's opinion, Dr. Smith's, on the survival chances of a patient after a heart transplant.
  The patient did not survive the surgery, suggesting an error was made in the surgery.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
The argument in the passage is about a prediction made by Wells, an expert in concert business, which did not come true.
Option A presents a similar pattern of reasoning where Dr. Smith predicts a positive outcome of the surgery based on the surgeon's skill. The negative outcome of the surgery leads to the conclusion that it probably was not properly performed.
Option B is not similar since it concludes that the sample is labeled incorrectly, which is not directly related to the conclusion of the argument in the passage.
Option C is not similar since it concludes that the repair to the wall was not properly done based on the observation that one can still notice the damage. This observation does not directly relate to the conclusion of the argument in the passage.
Option D is not similar since it concludes that the builder was probably wrong based on the observation that the roof is already leaking and there have been no major storms. This observation does not directly relate to the conclusion of the argument in the passage.
Option E is not similar since it concludes that the tests were properly conducted based on the fact that they did find lead in the soil. The conclusion of the argument in the passage is based on the fact that the concert did not sell out, which is different from Option E.
Therefore, the answer is A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument uses Wells' knowledge of the concert business to make a prediction about the concert's success.
  The concert did not sell out, which is evidence that it was not properly promoted.
  Choice (A) uses Dr. Smith's expertise to make a prediction about the patient's survival.
  The patient did not survive, which is evidence that the surgery was not properly performed.
  Therefore, the pattern of reasoning in choice (A) is most similar to that in the argument above.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument in the passage is about a concert not selling out despite Wells' knowledge that it would sell out unless poorly promoted.
  The correct answer choice should have a similar pattern of reasoning where an expert's prediction is contradicted by the actual outcome.
  Option A is about a cardiologist's prediction that a patient would survive a surgery if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon, but the patient did not survive the surgery.
  Option B is about a chemist's prediction that a sample would not contain organic compounds, and the conclusion is that the sample is not labeled correctly.
  Option C is about a home renovator's prediction that wall damage would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired, but the damage is still noticeable.
  Option D is about a builder's prediction that a roof would not require repairs unless it is damaged in a storm, but the roof is already leaking.
  Option E is about an expert's prediction that tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted, and the tests did find lead in the soil.
  Option E has a similar pattern of reasoning as the argument in the passage where an expert's prediction is confirmed by the actual outcome.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument says that walking upright is a natural and instinctive behavior of Kodiak bears, not a learned behavior.
  The question asks for the criticism that is most vulnerable to the argument.
  Choice A is incorrect because the argument does not generalize from a few bears, but from the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear.
  Choice B is not a criticism of the argument itself, but a possibility that is not considered by the argument.
  Choice C is incorrect because the term "behavior" is used consistently throughout the argument.
  Choice D is not a criticism of the argument itself, but a general criticism of the argument's assumption about human behavior.
  Choice E is incorrect because the argument does not appeal to the authority of science, but rather uses scientific evidence to support its claim.
  Therefore, there is no strong criticism of the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for Kodiak bears and is instinctive and not learned.
  The argument does not generalize from a few bears, but instead, talks about the species as a whole.
  The argument does not fail to consider the possibility of both learning and an innate capacity as the reason for walking on hind legs since it claims that it is instinctive.
  The argument does not change the meaning of the word "behavior" during the course of the argument.
  The argument does not presume that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways since it only talks about one behavior of a specific species.
  The argument appeals to scientific research to support its conclusion, which is a proper and common way of making an argument.
  Therefore, the argument is not vulnerable to any of the given criticisms.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that walking on hind legs is completely natural behavior for Kodiak bears based on their bone structure.
  The argument does not generalize from the behavior of one or a few bears but rather cites the bone structure of the species.
  The argument does not assume that all behavior can be explained in only two ways.
  The argument does not change the meaning of the word "behavior" during the course of the argument.
  The argument does not appeal to the authority of science in an incorrect way.
  The argument could be vulnerable to the possibility that walking on hind legs is not solely instinctive or innate, but the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that walking on hind legs is completely natural behavior for Kodiak bears because of their bone structure.  
  It does not claim that all Kodiak bears behave in the same way or that this behavior accounts for all bear behavior.
  Therefore, choice A is not the correct answer.
  The argument specifically refers to the instinctive behavior of Kodiak bears and does not exclude the possibility of learned behavior.
  Therefore, choice B is not the correct answer.
  The word "behavior" is used consistently throughout the argument.
  Therefore, choice C is not the correct answer.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In marketing their products, drug companies often send gifts to physicians. According to a recent survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Question: If the survey results are accurate, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs than those who do accept such gifts.
  B: Most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians.
  C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  D: Some physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts.
  E: All physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The survey results indicate that most physicians believe that their own choices are not influenced by drug companies' gifts but other physicians' prescription choices are.
  Therefore, it is possible that some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts or the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  Answer C is a possible conclusion based on the given information.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  According to the survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  If the survey results are accurate, then some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The survey indicates that physicians believe that their own choices are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but other physicians' choices are influenced by such gifts.
  Some physicians may be mistaken about their own susceptibility to the influence of drug companies' gifts or the influence of such gifts on other physicians.
  Therefore, it is likely that some physicians are mistaken in their beliefs about the influence of gifts from drug companies.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  According to the survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  The statement that must be true based on this survey is the one that accurately represents the survey results.
  Choice A is not mentioned in the survey results.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the survey results.
  Choice E is too extreme based on the survey results.
  Choice D is not a necessary conclusion based on the survey results because it says "some" physicians, not "most".
  Choice C accurately reflects the survey results because it says that "some" physicians are mistaken about the influence of drug company gifts on themselves or others.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  According to the survey, most physicians believe that their own prescription choices are not influenced by drug companies' gifts but other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  Some physicians may be mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  Therefore, the correct answer should focus on the likelihood of physicians' prescription choices being influenced by gifts from drug companies.
  Option A and B are not mentioned in the context.
  Option C is a possible answer but it doesn't necessarily have to be true as the survey only discusses the beliefs of physicians.
  Option D is a possible answer, but the context does not provide direct evidence to support it.
  Option E is too extreme and goes beyond the survey findings.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  Most physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  So, some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  Therefore, the answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The survey results indicate that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. 
  The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  Therefore, there seems to be a disparity between what physicians believe about themselves and what they believe about other physicians.
  If the survey results are accurate, this disparity means that some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The survey indicates that most physicians believe that their own prescription choices are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  Some physicians may be mistaken about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  Therefore, C could be the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  Most physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  The survey suggests that physicians may be mistaken either about their own susceptibility to influence by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  Therefore, it must be true that some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The survey results indicate that most physicians believe that their own prescription choices are not influenced by drug companies' gifts but believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The professor argues that freedom of thought alone does not lead to intellectual progress; rather, intellectual progress requires intellectual discipline.
  The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if it is assumed that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The conclusion drawn by the professor is that the argument for freedom of thought fails.
  The argument presented is that intellectual progress requires intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  To confirm the validity of the conclusion, we need to identify an assumption that underlies the argument presented by the professor.
  Choice A states that thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress, but this does not necessarily relate to the argument presented by the professor.
  Choice B states that thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress, but this is not an assumption made by the professor.
  Choice C states that in societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline, but this contradicts the argument presented by the professor.
  Choice D states that freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth, but this is not an assumption made by the professor.
  Choice E states that without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought, which directly relates to the argument presented by the professor.
Therefore, assuming that without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought, the conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that freedom of thought is not enough to make intellectual progress.
  It states that intellectual discipline is needed to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  The conclusion follows logically if it is assumed that intellectual discipline is necessary to make intellectual progress.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The professor argues that freedom of thought is not sufficient for making intellectual progress.
  The argument is based on the premise that thinkers need intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  The conclusion follows logically if we assume that freedom of thought alone is not enough to achieve this.
  Option (E) suggests that intellectual discipline is a prerequisite for freedom of thought, which supports the professor's argument. Hence, this is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that freedom of thought is not enough to make intellectual progress, as thinkers need intellectual discipline as well, to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  To determine which answer choice follows logically if this statement is assumed, we need to find the assumption that is necessary for the conclusion to be true.
  The argument does not mention any connection between intellectual progress and society, creativity, or limited line of thought to a particular orthodoxy.
  The only assumption that seems necessary for the conclusion to follow is that intellectual discipline is necessary for mining the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The professor argues that intellectual discipline is necessary for thinkers to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  The professor argues that freedom of thought, on its own, is not enough to make intellectual progress.
  The conclusion drawn by the professor will be valid if we assume that freedom of thought does not necessarily lead to intellectual discipline.
  Thus, if choice C is assumed, then the argument for freedom of thought fails.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument for freedom of thought fails because intellectual progress requires intellectual discipline.
  Therefore, if the assumption is made that thinkers need intellectual discipline to make intellectual progress, then the conclusion that the argument for freedom of thought fails follows logically.
  Choice A is not relevant to the conclusion.
  Choice B is not relevant to the conclusion.
  Choice C is contrary to the conclusion.
  Choice D is not relevant to the conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, but it is not enough for making progress.
  To make progress, thinkers need intellectual discipline to explore interrelated ideas.
  Therefore, the argument fails.
  The conclusion follows logically if the assumption is that freedom of thought is not sufficient for making intellectual progress.
  So, choice D is not relevant to the conclusion drawn by the professor.
  Choice A, B, and E are not directly related to the conclusion.
  Choice C is actually the opposite of what the argument says.
  Therefore, none of the options are valid assumptions for the conclusion drawn by the professor.
  However, the best option among them is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The professor argues that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress.
  Intellectual discipline is necessary to fully explore the implications of interrelated ideas.
  Therefore, the professor concludes that freedom of thought is not a precondition for intellectual progress.
  To support this view, we need to find an assumption that supports the need for intellectual discipline.
  (A) talks about the negative effect of limiting the line of thought, but doesn't relate it directly to intellectual discipline.
  (B) talks about the need for society that values intellectual progress, but doesn't directly support the need for intellectual discipline.
  (C) contradicts the professor's view by arguing that freedom of thought is not enough.
  (D) talks about the benefits of freedom of thought, but doesn't relate it directly to intellectual discipline.
  (E) supports the conclusion by stating the need for intellectual discipline to have the freedom of thought.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that the argument for freedom of thought fails because intellectual discipline is also necessary for intellectual progress.
  The assumption needed is that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress.
  Choice A supports freedom of thought and does not challenge it.
  Choice B is not related to the argument about the relationship between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline.
  Choice C contradicts the argument that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress.
  Choice D supports freedom of thought but does not challenge the need for intellectual discipline.
  Choice E states that intellectual discipline is necessary for freedom of thought, which is opposite to the argument that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument is about the feeding habits of Diplodocus, based on models of its neck structure. 
The assumption required by the argument would be a statement that links the neck structure features to the feeding habits of this animal.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is not mentioned in the argument.
Option C is not related to the argument.
Option D is possible, but the argument states that the Diplodocus "could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land."
Option E is also possible, but the argument states that "Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater."
The assumption required by the argument is that the features of the neck structure of Diplodocus determine their feeding habits. 
Thus, the answer is: A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground or underwater based on the computer models that showed Diplodocus's neck bones wouldn't allow for raising its neck to browse high-growing vegetation.
  The assumption required by the argument is something that must be true in order for the conclusion to be true.
  Choice A is not related to the argument, it talks about a modern animal's neck structure.
  Choice B is not necessary for the argument, it talks about Diplodocus's vision.
  Choice C is not necessary for the argument, it talks about the brain's blood supply.
  Choice D is close to the argument but the argument doesn't say anything about Diplodocus's hind legs.
  Choice E contradicts the argument as it says Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation, but the argument says that Diplodocus accessed underwater vegetation.
  None of the choices appears to be necessary for the conclusion, so the answer is "None of the above."
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument is about the feeding habits of Diplodocus.
  The argument states that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented upward movement of the neck.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument should be a premise that is necessary to draw the conclusion.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D is not necessary since it is mentioned in the argument that Diplodocus could bend downward and/or extend below ground level to access food.
  Choice E is relevant since it contradicts the argument's conclusion.
  The only assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater because the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented it from raising its very long neck.
  An assumption required by the argument should be a premise that the argument depends on and is reasonably true.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument because it is about modern animals, not Diplodocus.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument because the argument does not mention anything about Diplodocus's ability to see in front of itself.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument because it talks about blood supply to an elevated brain, which the argument did not mention.
  Choice D is also incorrect because the argument does not claim that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
  Choice E, however, is relevant to the argument because it talks about Diplodocus's ability to browse for underwater vegetation, which is one of the options mentioned by the argument.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
The argument is about the feeding behavior of Diplodocus.
The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
The argument is based on the notion that Diplodocus's neck bones prevent it from raising its neck to reach treetop foliage.
The argument is also based on computer models that show Diplodocus's neck could bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing it to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
To answer the question, we need to identify the assumption required by the argument.
Choice A is irrelevant to the argument because the argument is not about the neck structure of other animals.
Choice B is not an assumption required by the argument.
Choice C is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about Diplodocus's feeding behavior.
Choice D is not an assumption required by the argument because it is not necessary to assume that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation.
Choice E is relevant to the argument because it challenges the notion that Diplodocus could not browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them. If Diplodocus could browse for underwater vegetation in this way, then the argument's conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater, would be weakened.
Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus could not have raised its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Instead, Diplodocus could have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  Therefore, the argument would require an assumption that supports the idea that Diplodocus had the ability to feed on plants in these ways.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Option C is not relevant to the argument.
  Option D is not required because the argument already provides an alternative suggestion for how Diplodocus could have accessed high-growing vegetation.
  Option E is relevant to the argument as it speaks to the alternative ways Diplodocus could have accessed aquatic vegetation.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater, instead of high-growing vegetation.
  The argument is based on the computer models that showed the neck structure of Diplodocus would have prevented it from raising its neck to feed on high-growing vegetation.
  The assumption should be related to the argument's conclusion.
  Choice A, B, C and E are not related to the argument's conclusion.
  Choice D might be related to the argument's conclusion. However, the argument does not mention any other way Diplodocus could access high-growing vegetation.
  Therefore, there is no assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument talks about Diplodocus's neck bone structure and how it is not suitable for high neck movements.
  Computer models have shown that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level.
  Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption has to be an idea that is required by the argument to hold true.

Action: Answer("D") 
  The argument focuses on how Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater. Thus, the assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs. Choice D states this assumption.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument presented indicates that Diplodocus could not have browsed for high-growing vegetation by raising its neck.
  Instead, the neck could bend downward and extend below ground level to allow Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation.
  The conclusion is that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  An assumption required by the argument should be something that must be true for the conclusion to be valid.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument since it concerns modern ground-feeding animals.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument and is, therefore, outside the scope.
  Choice C talks about blood supply to Diplodocus's brain, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument since it discusses Diplodocus's other ways of accessing high-growing vegetation.
  Choice E, which discusses browsing for underwater vegetation, is relevant to the argument since the conclusion is that Diplodocus could feed on underwater vegetation.
  If Diplodocus were able to browse for underwater vegetation in other ways, it would weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented raising its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Instead, Diplodocus could bend downward and even extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
  An assumption required by this argument would be a statement that supports Diplodocus's neck structure allowing for downward bending and extension.
  Choices A, B, C, and D all make statements that are not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E makes a statement about Diplodocus's ability to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
  However, this statement does not support the argument's conclusion.
  Therefore, the correct answer is None of the Above.

Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that the official results must be rigged because everyone the arguer knows voted against the proposal.
  However, the people the arguer knows are unlikely to be a representative sample of the entire population.
  Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  The answer is A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is based on anecdotal evidence.
  The fact that the author knows people who voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people did so.
  The argument does not take into account the possibility of a biased sample.
  Therefore, the flaw in the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument presumes that the speaker and their acquaintances are representative of the general population.
  Anecdotal evidence can be misleading and is not a reliable way to determine the outcome of an election.
  Therefore, the flaw in the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is based on anecdotal evidence, which is unlikely to be representative of the population as a whole.
  An individual's social circle is not necessarily representative of the entire population.
  Therefore, the argument uses evidence that is likely to be unreliable.
  The flaw in the argument is that it relies on anecdotal evidence rather than official results or a representative sample.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The person is using anecdotal evidence, which is not a good representation.
  The person assumes that everyone he knows should be a good representation of the entire population.
  Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim that most people voted against it.
  The flaw in reasoning is that the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The speaker argues that the official results of the referendum must be rigged because everyone they know voted against the proposal.
  However, just because the people they know voted against the proposal does not mean that most people voted against it. 
  It's possible that the speaker's acquaintances are not representative of the general population.
  Therefore, the flaw in the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument uses personal anecdote rather than verifiable data.
  Personal anecdotes are not representative of the general population.
  Therefore, the evidence used is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  The flaw in the reasoning is that the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument states that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal.
  But the official results state that 80% of the voters voted in favor of the proposal.
  It is likely that the people the speaker knows do not constitute a representative sample of the entire population.
  Therefore, the argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  The answer is A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Consumer magazine: Because front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers. So, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument in the consumer magazine?
Choices:
  A: All top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water.
  B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.
  C: A washing machine gets clothes really clean only with a laundry detergent specially formulated for that machine.
  D: A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
  E: Washers that use more water get clothes cleaner than those that use less.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers.
  Ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers.
  To get clothes really clean in front-loading washers, you need to use a detergent formulated for front-loading washers.
  The argument assumes that there is a difference in detergent formulation between front-loading washer detergent and ordinary powder detergent.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers due to less water usage.
  Therefore, to get clothes really clean, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is required.
  The argument assumes that the use of a detergent formulated for front-loading washers will dissolve readily in them to get clothes really clean.
  So, option B is relevant to the argument and supports it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument in the consumer magazine is that to get clothes clean in a front-loading washer, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers must be used.
  For this argument to hold true, an assumption must connect the relationship between using regular detergent and not getting clothes clean, with using specially formulated detergent and getting clothes really clean in a front-loading washer.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is not required, as the argument is not about the differences in the dissolving ability of detergents between machines.
  Option C is not required, as the argument is not about the necessity of using specially formulated detergents for any washer to get clothes clean.
  Option D is the assumption required by the argument, as it connects the relationship between getting clothes clean and the ability of the detergent to dissolve in the washer.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument in the consumer magazine is that front-loading washers need a special detergent because ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in them.
  To support this argument, an assumption is needed that relates to why ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers.
  Choice B suggests a possible reason why a special detergent is needed.
  Choice C is too extreme because it suggests that every washer requires a special detergent, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice D is too broad because it suggests that a laundry detergent does not work at all, which is not supported by the argument.
  Choice A and E are not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers, so a detergent formulated for front-loading washers is needed.
  Therefore, the argument assumes that a laundry detergent must dissolve readily in a washer to get clothes really clean.
  Choice D states this assumption and is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers because they use less water than top-loading washers.
  To get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, the consumer magazine suggests using a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers.
  This suggests that the type of detergent matters in getting clothes clean in a front-loading washer.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that the type of detergent used affects the cleaning ability of a washer.
  Choice B suggests that a laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers, but this is not required by the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers.
  Therefore, to get clothes really clean in front-loading washers, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is required.
  The assumption required is that ordinary powder detergent cannot get clothes really clean in front-loading washers.
  Therefore, C is not relevant, E is irrelevant, A is incorrect, and B is not necessary.
  The assumption required is D, that laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument in the consumer magazine is that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, one needs to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers.
  Therefore, for the argument to hold, there must be an assumption that supports it.
  If a laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in top-loading machines, then the argument would not be valid.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument in the consumer magazine is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The consumer magazine argues that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers, and therefore, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed to get clothes really clean in them.
  The argument assumes that there is a significant difference between the performance of ordinary powder detergent and front-loading detergent in getting clothes clean in front-loading washers.
  Option B is the only answer that fulfills the assumption because it addresses the performance difference between ordinary powder detergent and front-loading detergent specifically for front-loading washers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that ordinary detergent doesn't work well in front-loading washers, so a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is needed to clean clothes. This assumes that the detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers cleans clothes better in front-loading washers than ordinary detergent. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester has not received a raise, so it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation.
Question: The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
  B: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  C: My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house. Since anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own it.
  D: My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Since no one who lives in a house both O'WIlS it and pays rent on it, it must be that my next-door neighbors pay rent on their heuse.
  E: Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Therefore, it must be that they pay rent on it.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that there is a rule that no one receives both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  The argument concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise.
  The argument assumes that the only possible reason for not receiving a raise is a poor performance evaluation.
  This is a flawed reasoning, as there could be other reasons for not receiving a raise.
  Choice D shares a similar flawed reasoning as the argument above.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that since no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise, and that Lester has not received a raise, then he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  This conclusion is flawed because there could be other reasons why Lester has not received a raise.
  Similarly, in option B, the flawed reasoning concludes that since no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, and that the next-door neighbors own their house, then it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  This conclusion is also flawed because there could be other reasons why the next-door neighbors do not pay rent on their house.
  Thus, the flawed reasoning in the given argument is most similar to the reasoning in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that no one at Leila's Electronics who received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  The argument also states that Lester did not receive a raise.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that Lester received a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument assumes that not receiving a raise means receiving a poor performance evaluation.
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise.
  Choice A is a similar argument because it assumes that paying rent means not owning the house.
  This is flawed reasoning because owning or not owning a house does not necessarily depend on paying rent.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  The argument then uses this to conclude that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  This argument concludes that since something has not happened, something else must have happened, without providing any evidence to support the claim.
  Option A is the most similar argument as it concludes that since the next-door neighbors pay rent, they do not own their house.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument is based on a negative correlation. 
  It states that if an employee does not receive a raise, then they must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  This is an example of a flawed reasoning because there may be other reasons why an employee did not receive a raise.
  Option A is the same reasoning as the argument above.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is of the form of A implies not B, not A therefore B.
  The reasoning is flawed because there are other reasons B could be true or false.
  Choice A is similarly flawed as the argument above, but the conclusion is opposite.
  Choice B is not the same since the argument is of the form A implies B, A therefore B.
  Choice C is not the same since the argument is of the form not A implies not B, not B therefore A.
  Choice D is similar to the argument above, but the conclusion is opposite.
  Choice E is not the same since the argument is of the form A implies B, not B therefore not A.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in choice D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because no one at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor evaluation and a raise.
  This conclusion is flawed because not receiving a raise does not mean one has received a poor evaluation. 
  Choice A is flawed using the same reasoning because paying rent does not mean one does not own a house. 
  Choice B is not flawed since it follows the pattern of the initial argument, but in the opposite direction.
  Choice C is flawed because not paying rent does not mean one owns a house.
  Choice D is flawed because not owning a house does not mean one pays rent on it.
  Choice E is flawed since not owning a house does not automatically mean one pays rent on it.
  Therefore, the answer is A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument says that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  This argument is flawed because it assumes that if someone does not receive a raise, then they must have received a poor performance evaluation. This may not be true if there are other reasons why someone did not receive a raise.
  Among the answer choices, the argument in option B follows a similar flawed reasoning where it assumes that since someone owns a house, they must not pay rent on it.
  Therefore, the answer is B: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that receiving a poor performance evaluation is the only reason someone would not receive a raise.
  The correct conclusion would be that it is possible that Lester has received a poor performance evaluation, but it is not the only possibility.
  Choice A is similar because it assumes that paying rent is the only reason someone would not own a house.
  The correct conclusion would be that it is possible that the neighbors do not own the house, but it is not the only possibility.
  Therefore, the answer is A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
The argument given above has a conditional statement that says "No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise."
It is then concluded that "Lester has not received a raise, so it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation."
The reasoning is flawed because there could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise.
Option A also has a similar reasoning where the conditional statement is "No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it" which is then concluded that "since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it."
The conclusion is not necessarily true since there could be other scenarios where they pay rent and still own the house.
Option B has the correct reasoning where it says "No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it."
The reasoning is flawed because owning the house and paying rent are not mutually exclusive.
Option C is incorrect because it is assuming that if the neighbors did not pay rent, then they must own the house which is not necessarily true.
Option D has a similar reasoning to option A and is incorrect.
Option E has a similar reasoning to option C and is incorrect.
Therefore, the answer is B: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The principle stated above says that if someone in the position of the party to whom the offer was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest, then the offer is not legitimate.
  Choice B is consistent with the principle because it says that the contract is not valid if the offer was made in jest.
  Choices A, C, D, and E do not directly involve the issue of whether an offer is legitimate or not.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
The principle stated in the context is related to the validity of a contract based on a legitimate offer. 
The option that justifies the reasoning is the one that best applies the principle. 
Option A refers to a legitimate offer and an absence of rejection, but it doesn't mention the principle of a jest offer.
Option B presents a scenario where an offer was made in jest and therefore doesn't justify the validity of the contract based on the principle.
Option C assumes that Frank's offer is legitimate and that Mindy should accept it if she is reasonable but doesn't mention anything about the principle of a jest offer.
Option D refers to an offer that was not made in jest and was reasonable for Lea to accept; this applies the principle of the validity of a contract based on a legitimate offer.
Option E doesn't refer to the principle of a legitimate offer and whether it was made in jest or not.
Therefore, the answer is D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A only refers to a legitimate offer and doesn't address the reasoning for determining whether an offer is legitimate.
  Option B's reasoning aligns with the principle stated above. Kenta accepted Gus's offer as legitimate, however, the offer was made in jest; thus, the contract was not valid.
  Option C only discusses the legitimacy of the offer but doesn't address how to determine it.
  Option D aligns with the principle stated above. The offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest; thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  Option E doesn't address the principle stated above.
  The best answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The principle stated above says that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A is correct because if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other, there is a valid contract.
  Option B is correct because if Gus made the offer in jest, then it is not legitimate and the contract is not valid.
  Option C is incorrect because it assumes that Frank's legitimate offer will be accepted by Mindy, but it does not guarantee a valid contract.
  Option D is correct because if the offer was made in such a way that no one would reasonably believe it to be made in jest and Lea accepts the offer, then they have a valid contract.
  Option E is incorrect because it assumes that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not legitimate, but it does not provide any evidence to support this claim.
  Therefore, the answer is either A, B, or D.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
The principle states that a contract is valid only if an offer is legitimate.
A legitimate offer is one that is not made in jest.
Choice A and C are invalid because they do not consider whether the offer was legitimate or not.
Choice B is correct because it considers whether an offer made was in jest or not, which makes the contract invalid.
Choice D is also valid because it considers whether an offer made was legitimate or not, which if legitimate forms a valid contract.
Choice E is incorrect because the principle above states that the contract is only invalid if the offer was not legitimate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  The argument that best justifies the principle is the one that accurately applies the principle.
  Option A talks about a legitimate offer and lack of rejection, but it does not use the principle to make its argument.
  Option B accurately applies the principle to an example of an offer made in jest.
  Option C talks about Mindy being a reasonable person, but it does not use the principle to make its argument.
  Option D accurately applies the principle to an example of an offer made in such a way that it was not believed to be made in jest.
  Option E talks about a non-legitimate offer, but it does not use the principle to make its argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest. 
Option A is relevant to the principle of legitimate offers but does not address the requirement of the second part of the principle. 
Option B is consistent with the principle stated above.
Option C is incorrect because it implies that the offer is legitimate if Mindy accepts it, but the principle focuses on whether the offer is legitimate and not whether it is accepted or not.
Option D is relevant to a legitimate offer, but it only addresses one part of the principle. 
Option E is not relevant to the principle of legitimate offers.
Therefore, the answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A states that Joe made a legitimate offer to Sandy and Sandy has not rejected it. Thus, there was a valid contract. This argument is not affected by the principle stated above.
  Option B states that Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods. But Gus made the offer in jest, and thus the contract was not valid. This argument is in line with the principle stated above.
  Option C states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business was legitimate. However, whether Mindy accepts the offer or not has nothing to do with the principle stated above.
  Option D states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. This argument is in line with the principle stated above.
  Option E states that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one, regardless of whether Sal made it in jest. This argument is not affected by the principle stated above.
  Therefore, the principle stated above most helps to justify the reasoning in Option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The principle explained in the context suggests that a legitimate offer must be accepted for a valid contract. If someone, who is in the position of the party to whom the offer was made, reasonably believes that the offer was made in jest, then the offer is not legitimate. 
A) The reasoning in option A is justified as it talks about making a legitimate offer and Sandy not rejecting the offer. 
B) The reasoning in option B is justified as Kenta accepted Gus's offer, but Gus made the offer in jest, so the offer was not legitimate, and thus the contract was not valid.
C) The reasoning in option C is not justified as it only talks about making a legitimate offer and does not mention the acceptance or non-acceptance of the offer. 
D) The reasoning in option D is justified as it talks about Hai's offer being made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
E) The reasoning in option E is not justified as it mentions that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not legitimate, but it does not talk about legitimate or non-legitimate offers in general.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The principle states that a legitimate offer should not be taken as a jest.
  Choices A and D involve legitimate offers.
  Choice B, the offer was made in jest, which would violate the principle stated above.
  Choice C, the reasonability of Mindy is not the issue.
  Choice E, the only offer was not legitimate, but it does not involve jested offers.
  The answer is D since it involves a legitimate offer that is not taken as a jest.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage states that horror stories of both kinds share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  None of the choices describes both features.
  Choice A says all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature, but it does not mention the intention to produce dread in the reader. 
  Choice B says any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader, but it does not mention horror stories of any kind.
  Choice C says horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed, but it does not mention violations of the laws of nature or the intention to produce dread in the reader.
  Choice D says most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views, but it does not mention violations of the laws of nature or the intention to produce dread in the reader.
  Choice E says some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature, but it does not mention the intention to produce dread in the reader.
  Therefore, none of the choices is true based on the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage states that horror stories of both kinds describe violations of the laws of nature and produce dread in the reader.
  However, it does not state that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature or that all stories that describe violations of a law of nature intend to invoke dread in the reader.
  It also does not state that horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed or that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  It does suggest that some horror stories about monstrous beasts use symbolism to represent psychological disturbances in the protagonist.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage defines two kinds of horror stories that share two features.
  One of the features shared by both types of horror stories is that they describe violations of the laws of nature.
  The other feature is that they intend to produce dread in the reader.
  Therefore, the statement that must also be true is one that relates to one or both of these two features.
  Option A is incorrect because not all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  Option B is incorrect because the passage only notes that horror stories with violations of the laws of nature intend to produce dread in the reader.
  Option C is incorrect because the passage does not make any generalization about the psychological state of characters in horror stories.
  Option D is incorrect because the passage does not make any generalization about the views of authors of horror stories about mad scientists.
  Option E is a possibility since the passage notes that some horror stories may employ symbolism to describe violations of the laws of nature.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage states that both horror stories about mad scientists and monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature, and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  The passage also states that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, but there's no mention of this being true for mad scientist stories.
  Therefore, the answer cannot be A, C, or D.
  The passage also states that both kinds of horror stories share two features: the descriptions of violations of the laws of nature and the intent to produce dread in the reader.
  Therefore, it is possible that other stories that describe a violation of a law of nature intends to invoke dread in the reader.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  It does not say that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature, so A is false.
  It also does not say that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader, so B is false.
  The passage states that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, but it does not say that all horror stories describe characters who are psychologically disturbed, so C is false.
  The passage states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. It does not say that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views, so D is false.
  The passage does not explicitly state that stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature, so E is also false.
  None of the choices is completely true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage states that both horror stories about mad scientists and stories about monstrous beasts share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader. 
  Therefore, any statement that contradicts these two features of horror stories would not have to be true.
  Statement A is incorrect because the passage only states that horror stories about monstrous beasts sometimes describe violations of the laws of nature, not that all of them do.
  Statement B is incorrect because the passage only states that horror stories that describe violations of the laws of nature are intended to produce dread in the reader, not that all stories that describe violations of the laws of nature are intended to do so.
  Statement C is incorrect because the passage does not state that horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed. It only states that some horror stories about monstrous beasts use the monster to symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  Statement D is incorrect because the passage only states that horror stories about mad scientists express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, not that most of them express antiscientific views.
  Statement E is correct because the passage states that some horror stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature, which is consistent with the two features that horror stories share.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage states that horror stories of both kinds describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  This does not necessarily mean that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  The passage also states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
  This does not necessarily mean that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  The statement that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader is not supported by the passage.
  The statement that horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed is not supported by the passage.
  The statement that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature is supported by the passage since it states that some horror stories about monstrous beasts symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. 
Therefore, the answer is E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that both horror stories about mad scientists and monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  It also states that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, and horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
  None of the statements in the passage suggest that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature, or that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  The passage suggests that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  The passage does not suggest that horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed, but only mentions that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  The passage does mention that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
  Therefore, the statement that would also have to be true based on the passage is E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The statements above describe two kinds of horror stories, the shared characteristics of those stories, and the author's perspectives on them.
  The statements do not suggest that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature, so A is false.
  The statements state that horror stories are intended to produce dread in the reader, but not all stories that describe a violation of a law of nature are necessarily horror stories, so B is false.
  The statements suggest that some horror stories about monstrous beasts use the monster to symbolize a psychological disturbance, but not all horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed, so C is false.
  The statements indicate that horror stories about mad scientists express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, but not necessarily that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views, so D is false.
  The statements suggest that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature, which is true based on the information given.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
The passage clearly states that both horror stories about mad scientists and those about monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. Therefore, any statement that contradicts these facts would not be true.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: When surveyed about which party they would like to see in the legislature, 40 percent of respondents said Conservative, 20 percent said Moderate, and 40 percent said Liberal. If the survey results are reliable, we can conclude that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses premises about the actual state of affairs to draw a conclusion about how matters should be.
  B: The argument draws a conclusion that merely restates a premise presented in favor of it.
  C: The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
  D: The argument fails to consider that the survey results might have been influenced by the political biases of the researchers who conducted the survey.
  E: The argument uses evidence that supports only rough estimates to draw a precisely quantified conclusion.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument is based on a survey result.
  The survey result indicates that 40% of respondents said Conservative, 20% said Moderate, and 40% said Liberal.
  The argument concludes that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40% Conservative, 20% Moderate, and 40% Liberal.
  However, the argument assumes that the preferences of the survey respondents accurately reflect the preferences of the larger population.
  Therefore, the flaw in the argument is that it takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal based on the survey results.
  The argument assumes that the preferences of a group as a whole are the same as the preferences of most individual members of the group.
  This assumption is not necessarily true.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument draws a conclusion based on a survey result.
  The survey result shows 40% of respondents prefer Conservative, 20% Moderate, and 40% Liberal.
  The argument concludes that most citizens would like to see a legislature with the same percentages of Conservative, Moderate, and Liberal.
  The argument assumes that the respondents in the survey are representative of the population of citizens.
  However, the argument does not consider whether the sample size is sufficient, or whether there is a sampling bias.
  Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning is that the argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal, based on the survey results.
  However, it is possible that the preferences of a group as a whole are not the preferences of most individual members of the group.
  Therefore, the argument takes for granted an assumption that may not necessarily be true.
  The answer is C: The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal based on a survey.
  The survey results might not be reliable, and there might have been biases or errors in sampling, survey design, or data analysis.
  Therefore, the argument might be flawed for relying on flawed evidence to support its conclusion.
  Choice D mentions the possibility of political biases, which is a potential flaw in the survey results.
  While Choice A, B, and E are not directly relevant to the argument's flaw, Choice C might be the closest to an accurate description of the flaw.
  The argument assumes that the group's preferences are representative of the preferences of most individual members of the group, which might not be true.
  Therefore, I will choose C as the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument states that if the survey results are reliable, then we can conclude that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40% Conservative, 20% Moderate, and 40% Liberal.
  The argument assumes that the preferences of the group as a whole are the same as the preferences of most individual members of the group. 
  The argument is not restating any premise, but it may use rough estimates to draw a precisely quantified conclusion.
  The argument does not use premises about the actual state of affairs to draw a conclusion about how matters should be.
  The argument does not consider the political biases of the researchers who conducted the survey.
  Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is based on a survey where respondents were asked about their party preferences.
  The survey results indicate that 40% of respondents prefer Conservative, 20% prefer Moderate, and 40% prefer Liberal.
  The argument concludes that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40% Conservative, 20% Moderate, and 40% Liberal.
  The argument assumes that the preferences of the respondents reflect the preferences of most citizens.
  This assumption is flawed because the sample size of the survey is not known.
  The survey may not be representative of the entire population.
  Therefore, the conclusion is not necessarily accurate.
  Choice C accurately describes the flaw in the reasoning of the argument by suggesting that the argument assumes that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument presents survey results that are assumed to be reliable.
  The survey results show that 40% of respondents said Conservative, 20% said Moderate, and 40% said Liberal.
  The argument concludes that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40% Conservative, 20% Moderate, and 40% Liberal.
  The conclusion may not be correct because the argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
  Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal based on a survey.
  The survey represents the preferences of the respondents.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries because both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that there could be other factors that affected the outcome of the study.
  E is incorrect because it is talking about a different form of exercise.
  A, C, and D do not affect the study results directly.
  B suggests that the difficulty in performing stretches could be a factor that influenced the outcome of the study.
  Therefore, B weakens the researcher's argument the most.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find a statement that weakens this argument.
  If there is a reason that the study might not have produced accurate results, this would weaken the argument.
  Option B states that many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  This means that the group that did stretch might not have stretched as well as they could have, which could have affected the results and weakened the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find a statement that weakens this argument.
  An option that suggests stretching helps to prevent injuries would weaken the argument.
  Option E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
  Therefore, E is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this argument.
  Option E provides support to the other side of the argument.
  Option A does not weaken the argument.
  Option B shows the problem with the subjects but it doesn't contradict the argument.
  Option C is just a general statement.
  Option D is also not related to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries because both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A states that the injury rate for both groups of joggers was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  This indicates that the jogging groups may have been more careful or less prone to injury than the general population, and therefore stretching could have had a positive effect.
  Option A weakens the researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The medical researcher claims that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find a statement that weakens this argument.
  If there is evidence that stretching actually helps to prevent injuries, then the researcher's argument would be weakened.
  Choice E provides such evidence.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The researcher concludes that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken this argument, we need to show that stretching before jogging has an effect in preventing injuries.
  Among the given options, choice E directly contradicts the researcher's conclusion and states that stretching can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from exercise.
  Therefore, E is the answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument.
  Option B does not weaken the argument.
  Option C suggests that stretching might not help to prevent some types of jogging injuries.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument.
  Option E suggests that stretching might help to prevent certain forms of exercise injuries.
  Option C and E are the relevant options.
  Option E directly challenges the argument made by the researcher.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries based on the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that suggests stretching might still be beneficial in some way.
  Choice E provides evidence that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise, which casts doubt on the researcher's conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the researcher's claim.
  Among the choices, statement E provides evidence that contradicts the researcher's claim.
  Statement E suggests that in certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
  Therefore, statement E weakens the researcher's argument.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument in the question assumes that most of the sociology majors are taking a particular course, but most of the psychology majors are not.
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning as it assumes that the percentage of majors taking a particular course is the same as the percentage of majors enrolled in the course.
  Option B is similar to this pattern of reasoning as it assumes that the percentage of residents favoring increased spending on roads is the same as the percentage of residents opposed to increased spending on parks. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class, based on the fact that most of the sociology majors and not most of the psychology majors are taking the course.
  The argument assumes that only sociology and psychology majors are taking the course, which is not necessarily true.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in this argument is similar to that in option B, where the argument assumes that only two options exist and ignores any other possibilities.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The argument concludes that there are more sociology majors than psychology majors taking a particular course based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the course while most psychology majors are not. This conclusion cannot be drawn as there could be other factors impacting the enrollment. Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is similar to that in which one of the following:
  A: The flawed pattern of reasoning in this argument is dissimilar to that in option A, since the conclusion in option A is not dependent on a single factor.
  B: The flawed pattern of reasoning in this argument is similar to that in option B, since the conclusion in both arguments is drawn based on a single factor that may be impacted by other factors.
  C: The flawed pattern of reasoning in this argument is similar to that in option C, since the conclusion in both arguments is drawn based on a single factor that may be impacted by other factors.
  D: The flawed pattern of reasoning in this argument is dissimilar to that in option D, since the conclusion in option D is not dependent on a single factor.
  E: The flawed pattern of reasoning in this argument is dissimilar to that in option E, since the conclusion in option E is not dependent on a single factor.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class but most of the psychology majors are not. This conclusion doesn't necessarily follow logically, as it is possible that there are significantly more psychology majors overall, so that even though a smaller proportion of them are taking the class, their absolute numbers could still be greater than the number of sociology majors taking the class. 
  Choice B is the most similar to this pattern of flawed reasoning because it also extrapolates from a sample (the opinion poll of Silver Falls residents) to a broader population (most Silver Falls residents), without considering other factors that could affect the results of the poll or the composition of the broader population.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors taking the course based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the course while most psychology majors are not.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that the number of students taking the course is proportional to the number of students majoring in the subject.
  None of the choices have exactly the same flawed pattern of reasoning, but choice B is the most similar because it assumes that the number of individuals in favor of increased spending on roads is proportional to the number of Silver Falls residents.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors taking the class because of the difference in the number of students taking the course.
  The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning is one where the conclusion does not follow from the premise.
  Option B is similar in that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The argument above is based on the fact that most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology while most of the psychology majors are not, and concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class. However, this conclusion may not necessarily be true as it overlooks other factors such as the number of students enrolled in sociology and psychology majors, the required courses of each major, and so on. 
Looking at the answer choices, option B seems to have a similar flawed pattern of reasoning where the conclusion is based on a simple comparison of the number of residents who said they were in favor of increased spending on roads versus parks without considering other factors such as the total number of residents polled or the reasons why they preferred one over the other.
Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors but not the psychology majors are taking the class.
  The pattern of reasoning is flawed because the argument assumes that the proportion of majors taking the class is representative of the proportion of sociology and psychology majors at Morris University.
  Choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning where the argument assumes that the majority in an opinion poll represents the majority of the whole population.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scholar: Recently, some religions have updated the language of their traditional texts and replaced traditional rituals with more contemporary ones. These changes have been followed by increases in attendance at places of worship affiliated with these religions. This shows that any such modernization will result in increased numbers of worshipers.
Question: The scholar's reasoning is flawed because the scholar presumes without giving sufficient justification that
Choices:
  A: not every religion can update its texts and replace its traditional rituals
  B: modernization of religious texts and rituals will not involve an alteration of their messages
  C: the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance
  D: making texts and rituals more modern is the only way in which a religion could bring about an increase in attendance at places of worship
  E: the growth in attendance at places of worship affiliated with religions that made their texts and rituals more modern is irreversible
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The scholar states that modernizing religious texts and rituals will result in increased numbers of worshipers.
  The scholar provides evidence that an increase in attendance at places of worship affiliated with religions that made their texts and rituals more modern has followed changes to their texts and rituals.
  However, the scholar presumes that modernization of religious texts and rituals is the cause of this increase in attendance, without sufficient justification.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The scholar's argument is flawed.
  The scholar presumes that making a text and ritual more modern will result in an increased number of worshipers.
  The scholar does not give any reason for why modernization of texts and rituals would lead to increased attendance other than the observed correlation.
  Therefore, the scholar is assuming that the modernization of texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance.
  The flaw is that correlation does not imply causation.
  Choice C is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The scholar argues that any modernization of religious texts and rituals will result in an increase of worshipers.
  The scholar provides evidence that attendance at places of worship affiliated with religions that made changes in their traditional texts and rituals has increased.
  However, the scholar does not explore other variables that may have contributed to the increase in attendance.
  Therefore, the scholar presumes without giving sufficient justification that the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance.
  The correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The scholar believes that modernization of religious texts and rituals leads to an increase in attendance.
  However, the scholar has not provided enough evidence to support this claim.
  The scholar has also not considered other factors that could have led to the increase in attendance.
  Therefore, the reasoning is flawed because the scholar presumes without giving sufficient justification that the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance.
  The answer is C: the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The scholar claims that modernization will result in increased numbers of worshipers.
  The evidence provided in support of this claim is that some religions have updated the language of their traditional texts and replaced traditional rituals with more contemporary ones, and this has been followed by increases in attendance at places of worship affiliated with these religions.
  The flaw in the scholar's reasoning is that the scholar presumes without giving sufficient justification that making texts and rituals more modern is the only way in which a religion could bring about an increase in attendance at places of worship.
  Therefore, the answer is D: making texts and rituals more modern is the only way in which a religion could bring about an increase in attendance at places of worship.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
The scholar's argument is about the relationship between modernization of religious texts/rituals and increased attendance at places of worship.
The conclusion reached is that modernization will result in more worshipers.
However, the scholar presumes something that is not necessarily true in order to reach this conclusion.
Let's examine each option:
A: The argument doesn't make any reference to this, so it's irrelevant.
B: The argument doesn't make any reference to this, so it's irrelevant.
C: The argument assumes that modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance. This is the presumption behind the argument, so it is not flawed.
D: The argument doesn't make any reference to this, so it's irrelevant.
E: The argument doesn't make any reference to this, so it's irrelevant.
Therefore, the answer is C: the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance.
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The scholar argues that modernization of religious texts and rituals leads to an increase in attendance at places of worship affiliated with these religions.
  However, the scholar does not provide sufficient justification for this argument.
  The scholar does not consider alternative explanations that could lead to increased attendance, such as changes in leadership or community outreach programs.
  Therefore, the scholar presumes without giving sufficient justification that the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance.
  The answer is C: the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The scholar argues that changes in language of traditional texts and rituals resulted in increased attendance at places of worship. 
  The scholar does not provide evidence that modernization was the exclusive or primary cause of the increased attendance.
  Therefore, the scholar's argument is flawed because the scholar presumes without sufficient justification that modernization of religious texts and rituals was the only reason for the increase in attendance.
  The answer is C: the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The scholar argues that updates to texts and rituals have led to increased attendance at places of worship. 
  This assumes that other factors such as social, political, economic, or personal circumstances have not influenced the attendance increase. 
  Therefore, the scholar presumes without giving sufficient justification that the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance.
  The answer is C: the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Thought: 
  In passage A, people are said to compare their income with some norm and the norm rises along with the actual income. So, people want to have more income than others. 
  In passage B, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they have created value, and wanting to create value benefits society. 
  Therefore, the authors of passage A and passage B would most likely describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as wanting to create value which benefits society.
  The closest answer to this would be D: admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B discuss how people's happiness is influenced by their income relative to others.
  Passage A presents the idea that people care about their relative income and how it compares to others.
  Passage B argues that people care about earning more money because it makes them feel successful and creates value.
  Neither passage uses particularly negative or positive language to describe people who want to make more money than their neighbors.
  Therefore, the answer is not likely to be D: misguided, admirable or E: lucky, primitive.
  A and C are unlikely because the passages do not discuss people's personalities or emotional states.
  The most likely answer is B: altruistic, egocentric because it describes a person's motivation or perspective regarding making money.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A indicates that people compare themselves with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income.
  People are happier if they feel that they are successful, that they have created value.
  People use material wealth to show not just that they are prosperous, but that they are prosperous because they create value.
  Passage B suggests that wanting to create value benefits society, and it is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
  Therefore, the authors of both passages would most likely describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as admiral or as someone who wants to create value.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A and B discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  Passage A discusses the phenomenon of rivalry, where people want to be better off than others in their reference group.
  Passage B argues that people want to create value, and that wealth is a way of showing that they have been successful at creating value.
  The question asks how the authors would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Based on the discussion in the passages, it is more likely that the authors would describe such a person as misguided in Passage A and admirable in Passage B.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A talks about how people compare their income with some norm and how it affects happiness.
  It also mentions the phenomenon of rivalry where people are happy to be poorer if their relative position improves.
  Passage B, on the other hand, talks about how earning more makes people happier because it makes them feel successful and that they have created value.
  It also contradicts the theory that people want to make more money than their neighbors because of the urge to demonstrate superiority.
  Therefore, the authors of passage A would likely use the term "rivalrous" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  The authors of passage B, however, would likely use the term "ambitious" or "value-creating" to describe the same person.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A describes a phenomenon known as rivalry where people compare their income to others.
  It explains how people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income.
  The majority of people in the Solnick and Hemenway study chose the first option of earning $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000 to be happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved.
  Passage B explains the desire to create value benefits society and is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
  Therefore, neither passage is likely to use negative terms such as "misguided" and "primitive" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Neither passage is likely to use positive terms such as "altruistic" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Based on the passages, the person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is most likely to be described as "egocentric" in Passage A for wanting to be better off than others and "admirable" in Passage B for the desire to create value which benefits society.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A and B discuss how people compare their income with others and how it affects their happiness.
  The authors of Passage B suggest that people want to make more money to feel successful and create value.
  The authors of Passage A suggest that people want to make more money to keep up with the norm or to improve their relative position.
  Passage A implies that people who want to make more money than their neighbors may be motivated by rivalry.
  Passage B implies that people who want to make more money than their neighbors may be motivated by the desire to create value.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely use the terms "rivalrous" and "ambitious," respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A mentions that people compare their income with some norm and that norm must be rising along with actual income.
  In the study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway mentioned in Passage A, people were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved.
  Passage B mentions that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful.
  The authors of both passages seem to view the desire to make more money than one's neighbors positively.
  They argue that this desire is evidence of a desire to create value and benefits society.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely use the term "admirable" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A and B talk about people's desire to make more money than their neighbors.
  In Passage A, people are happy to be poorer as long as their relative position improves.
  In Passage B, people use material wealth not just to show prosperity but to show that they are prosperous because they create value.
  Both passages suggest that people who want to make more money than their neighbors do so out of the desire to create value.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and B would most likely describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "admirable."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The authors of the passages suggest that people want to make more money than their neighbors because they want to feel successful and create value.
  Passage B specifically argues that creating value benefits society and brings happiness.
  Neither passage uses words that suggest negative judgment towards people who want to make more money than their neighbors.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Increasing returns to scale refers to the phenomenon of increased efficiency and productivity that can be achieved through increased size.
  The example of the pin factory used by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations is a good illustration of increasing returns to scale.
  From the choices, option B seems to illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  A large bee colony is able to collect more nectar and divide the work of processing the nectar among more bees because some bees are solely dedicated to guarding nectar sources.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Increasing returns to scale is the tendency of larger businesses to have lower costs than smaller businesses because the cost of producing additional units of output decreases. 
  The passage provided a pin factory example, which showed that increased specialization leads to larger scale, lower costs, and greater production.
  Therefore, the answer choice that illustrates this concept should describe a situation where larger scale leads to lower costs and greater production.
  Answer choice A describes the opposite situation, where relaxing standards allows a company to employ fewer editors, which doesn't illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Answer choice B describes a situation where additional workers are used for a specific task, but doesn't describe how the larger scale leads to lower costs and greater production.
  Answer choice C describes a situation where a school district is able to accommodate more students but does not mention lower costs or greater production.
  Answer choice D mentions advances in technology but does not describe how larger scale leads to lower costs and greater production.
  Answer choice E describes a situation where a larger ant colony divided into smaller colonies that eventually grew larger and prosperous, but the larger scale of the ant colonies is not linked to lower costs or greater production.
  As none of the answer choices describes a situation where larger scale leads to lower costs and greater production, the answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The concept of increasing returns to scale suggests that the larger the business, the more specialized its workers can be, and, therefore, the more productive the workers can be. 
  Option A is incorrect because it doesn't relate to the concept of scale.
  Option B is incorrect because it doesn't relate to businesses and scale.
  Option C is incorrect because it doesn't relate to the concept of specialization.
  Option D is incorrect because while it describes a more-efficient process, it doesn't relate to the concept of bigger businesses being more productive.
  Option E is close, but it doesn't fully describe increasing returns to scale because it mentions that the original colony splits into two, rather than just growing in size.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that as the size/ scale of a business increases, efficiency and productivity also increase.
  The example of the pin factory, as mentioned in the passage, shows that by specializing in narrow tasks, employees can produce far more than they could if each worked independently.
  The bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and the more pins the factory can produce per worker.
  The answer choice that best illustrates this concept is the one that describes a situation where a larger scale leads to an increase in efficiency and productivity.
  Answer choice A describes how relaxing the standards for editors allows the publishing house to employ fewer editors, but this does not necessarily lead to an increase in efficiency and productivity.
  Answer choice B describes how a larger bee colony can collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony, but this example is not related to a business or industry.
  Answer choice C describes how a school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated by switching to year-round operation, but this does not necessarily lead to an increase in efficiency and productivity.
  Answer choice D describes how the lobster industry is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because of advances in technology, but this example is related to technological advancements rather than an increase in scale.
  Answer choice E describes how a large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies, leading to an overall increase in the number of ants.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 4:
Thought:
  Increasing returns to scale refer to the phenomenon in which the larger the operation, the more efficient it becomes, and the more can be produced per worker.
  The Pin Factory of Adam Smith is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  B is about the efficiency of a bee colony, but it doesn't portray the idea of increasing returns to scale.
  C is an example of improving capacity, but it doesn't portray the idea of increasing returns to scale.
  D is not an example of increasing returns to scale, but rather technological advances.
  E is about dividing and producing more ant colonies, but it doesn't portray the idea of increasing returns to scale.
  A may seem like an example of increasing returns to scale, but it is actually about cutting the number of editors by relaxing standards. This is not an example of a larger operation becoming more efficient.
  Therefore, none of the choices illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The second paragraph describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale means that the more a firm produces, the lower its costs.
  The paragraph gives the example of the pin factory where increased size leads to increased specialization and increased productivity.
  The answer choice that best illustrates this concept is the one where the larger size of the organization leads to increased productivity and lower costs.
  Choice B describes increased productivity but not necessarily lower costs.
  Choice C describes increased capacity, but not necessarily increased productivity.
  Choice D describes increased productivity due to technological advances but not due to increased size.
  Choice E describes increased quantity due to dividing and producing two competing colonies.
  The answer choice that best describes the concept of increasing returns to scale is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that increasing returns to scale allow for larger firms to achieve lower costs than smaller firms.
  The example of the pin factory shows how increased specialization leads to more efficient production.
  The passage also explains that increasing returns to scale lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Answer choice A describes how a publishing house can improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing standards, which reduces the number of editors needed. This does not relate to increasing returns to scale or the natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Answer choice B describes how a large bee colony can use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, which enables the colony to collect more nectar and feed a larger colony. This does not relate to increasing returns to scale or the natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Answer choice C describes how a school district can increase the total number of students accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation. This relates to increasing returns to scale and larger scale allowing for lower costs. However, it does not relate to the natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Answer choice D describes how advances in technology make the doors to lobster traps easier for lobsters to get through, which allows the lobster industry as a whole to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps. This example demonstrates increasing returns to scale and a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Answer choice E describes how a large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. This example does not relate to increasing returns to scale or the natural tendency toward monopoly.
Therefore, the answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Response 7:
Thought:
  According to the passage, increasing returns to scale mean that the bigger the business, the more it can produce per worker and the lower its costs will be.
  This will naturally lead to the tendency of driving smaller firms out of business, resulting in a few dominant players.
  The example that illustrates this concept should demonstrate how a company can become more efficient and productive as it grows larger.
  Option A shows that a publishing house is able to improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing standards, but not necessarily by increasing the size of the company.
  Option B provides an example of how a large bee colony can divide up work to be done, but not necessarily how it becomes more productive as it grows larger.
  Option C illustrates how more students can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, but this does not demonstrate how the size of the school district can lead to increasing returns to scale.
  Option D explains how advances in technology can make it easier for the lobster industry to catch more lobsters, but not necessarily how the size of the industry can lead to increasing returns to scale.
  Option E describes how a large ant colony can divide into two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. This example shows how the size of the colony can lead to increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The concept of increasing returns to scale means that the bigger a business becomes, the more specialized its workers can be, producing more per worker than if each worked independently. 
  Option A talks about reducing the number of editors in the publishing house, which goes against the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option B talks about utilizing some bees solely to guard nectar sources, which is not related to the production of more output per worker.
  Option C talks about switching to year-round operation to accommodate more students in a single building, not about producing more output per worker.
  Option D mentions the use of better technologies to catch more lobsters using the same number of traps, which is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option E talks about the production of two competing colonies, which is not related to the production of more output per worker.
Therefore, the answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage defines the concept of increasing returns to scale, which is when bigger firms can achieve a larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  The passage further explains that the Pin Factory demonstrates increasing returns to scale as it can produce more pins per worker as the size increases.
  Therefore, the answer should be the option in which a larger scale results in increased productivity, just like the Pin Factory.
  Option A is incorrect because a publishing house is able to greatly improve productivity by relaxing standards, not by increasing scale.
  Option B is incorrect because the bee colony is dividing labor to increase efficiency, but not necessarily scale.
  Option C is incorrect because the school district is able to accommodate more students with the same building by altering the schedule, not necessarily increasing scale.
  Option D is incorrect because advances in technology aid the lobster industry in catching more lobsters, but not necessarily by increasing scale.
  Option E is incorrect because the division of an ant colony does not necessarily result in increased productivity.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to
Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work
  B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work
  C: acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works
  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author discusses how Toni Morrison drew upon jazz music as the structuring principle for her novel Jazz.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.
Response 0:
Thought:
  In passage B, astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The prediction turned out to be incorrect, and they hypothesized the existence of another planet to explain the discrepancy.
  That planet was later discovered and named Neptune.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune would involve a similar situation where scientists hypothesize the existence of an unknown entity to explain a discrepancy, and that entity is later discovered.
  Choice C involves a hypothesis that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, and the hypothesis was later confirmed by the discovery of an impact crater. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune since there was no discrepancy that needed explaining.
  Choice D involves a discovery of rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. The discovery led to the conclusion that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune since there was no discrepancy that needed explaining.
  Choice E involves a postulate of a third undetected particle to explain a discrepancy in the decay of a neutron. The existence of the particle was later confirmed. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune since there was no discrepancy that needed explaining.
  Choice A involves Galileo's theory of tides that falsely predicted there is only one high tide per day. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune since there was no discrepancy that needed explaining.
  Choice B involves Edwin Hubble's discovery that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune since there was no discrepancy that needed explaining.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The discovery of Neptune is described in Passage B.
  It involves attempting to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The predicted orbit was found to be incorrect, and the astronomers hypothesized that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  The planet Neptune was discovered in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of a planet based on the hypothesis that it must exist to explain observed phenomena.
  The only choice that matches this description is A: Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage B describes the astronomers' prediction of the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, followed by the discovery of Neptune that brought their calculations into alignment with their observations. This situation is analogous to another scientific episode in which a failed prediction leads to the discovery of a new planet based on calculations using established laws and assumptions.
Option A describes a situation where Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted only one high tide per day, whereas there are two. This situation does not involve the discovery of a new planet based on calculations using established laws and assumptions.
Option B describes Edwin Hubble's discovery that Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right based on observing variable stars. This situation does not involve the discovery of a new planet based on calculations using established laws and assumptions.
Option C describes the postulation of an asteroid impact that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on observing high levels of iridium in rock core samples, followed by the discovery of a large impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula. This situation does not involve the discovery of a new planet based on calculations using established laws and assumptions.
Option D describes the discovery of rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. This situation does not involve the discovery of a new planet based on calculations using established laws and assumptions.
Option E describes Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of a third undetected particle during the decay of a neutron, which was later confirmed. This situation does not involve the discovery of a new planet based on calculations using established laws and assumptions.
Therefore, the most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune described in passage B is option D: Bernard Brunhes' discovery of rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage B describes how scientists discovered the planet Neptune by predicting its existence based on the discrepancies between observation and calculation.
  The scientists used auxiliary assumptions alongside Newton’s laws to make their predictions.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit, which they called Neptune.
  Later, they discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  The closest analogy to this discovery is an episode where a scientific hypothesis or prediction is based on observed data that is not explained by the prevailing theory or explanation, which is subsequently revised.
  Option C is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option D is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option E is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option A is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option B is not an episode of scientific hypothesis or prediction based on observed data that is not explained by the prevailing theory or explanation.
  Therefore, none of the options is analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the existence of a planet, which was later discovered, and which accounted for the discrepancy between the predicted orbit and the observed orbit of Uranus.
  Therefore, I need to look for a scientific episode where scientists predicted the existence of a phenomenon, and where the phenomenon was discovered after it was not observed at first.
  Answer A describes an incorrect prediction about ocean tides, which was later corrected.
  Answer B describes the discovery of Andromeda as a separate galaxy.
  Answer C describes the discovery of evidence of a large impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula, which supports the theory that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.
  Answer D describes the discovery that the Earth's magnetic field was reversed at some point in the past.
  Answer E describes the discovery of a third undetected particle that accounts for the discrepancy between the predicted energy of a neutron decay and the observed energy.
  Answer B, the discovery of Andromeda as a separate galaxy, does not match the criteria of the question.
  Answer A, C, D, and E all describe phenomena that were discovered after incorrect or incomplete predictions had been made.
  However, only Answer C, the discovery of evidence of a large impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula, matches the criteria of the question and is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune through observations of Uranus' orbit.
  Astronomers hypothesized the existence of an unobserved planet to explain the discrepancy between their predictions and observations.
  They then found Neptune in the precise location required to explain the discrepancy.
  None of the other answer choices describe a similar process of hypothesizing and finding an unobserved entity to explain a discrepancy in observations and predictions.
  Therefore, the answer is B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe. 
Action: Answer("B")

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the existence of Neptune based on observations of Uranus and other planets.
  They used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to make their predictions, but the predictions turned out to be wrong.
  The astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they called Neptune, and later discovered it in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of Pluto.
  Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune based on the need to explain the incorrect prediction of Uranus's orbit, which was based on auxiliary assumptions.
  The discovery of Neptune was the result of hypothesizing the existence of another planet based on the need to explain the incorrect prediction of Uranus's orbit, which was based on auxiliary assumptions.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is one that involves hypothesizing the existence of something based on the need to explain a discrepancy.
  The only choice that involves hypothesizing the existence of something based on the need to explain a discrepancy is choice C, which describes Walter Alvarez's postulation that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples and later discovering evidence of a large impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is often misleading, and policies should not be guided by these notions.
  The author suggests that the government should attempt to save as many lives as possible, subject to limited resources, and departures from this principle should be justified by specific considerations.
  The passage does not seem to support any of the given statements, but statement D seems to be closest to the author's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention.
  People do not always approve of the purpose for which people run the risks.
  The government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  The government's role in regulating air safety is mentioned, but the fact that the victims chose to fly would be largely irrelevant to decisions about it is not stated in the passage.
  The passage does not provide information about the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury for plane crashes, or any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  The definition of "voluntary" is a matter of degree, and people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks.
  Therefore, it can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with statement A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:

  The author argues that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary".
  Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness and the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can.
  None of the choices explicitly reflect the author's main argument.
  Choice A suggests that dangerous activities should not be protected, but the author does not make such a suggestion.
  Choice B does not accurately reflect the author's argument, as the author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk.
  Choice C is not mentioned in the passage.
  Choice D is similar to the author's argument that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  Choice E is contradicted by the passage, as the author states that with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, the voluntariness is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree.

Therefore, regulatory policy should focus on saving as many lives as possible, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction, and departures from this principle should be justified by identifying specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies. 
A: The author does not express a opinion regarding skydiving or other dangerous and socially useless activities.
B: The author does not express a specific opinion about the government's role in regulating air safety or policy experts' views on the relevance of voluntariness.
C: The author does not provide any comparative statistics between plane crashes and other kinds of risks incurred by airline passengers.
D: The author argues that it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred and that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. Instead, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
E: The author mentions that with some risks, such as an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, voluntariness may be entirely absent and that although most environmental, occupational, and other social risks are not all-or-nothing with regards to voluntariness, they are often characterized as "involuntary" when people do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. However, the author does not state that the main category of risk usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Therefore, the best answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the difficulty of determining when a risk is voluntarily incurred.
  The author also believes that judgments about whether a risk is voluntary or involuntary may not be useful in guiding policy decisions.
  The author suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with a statement that supports a better understanding of these factors.
  Statement A is a specific example of a risk that is dangerous and serves no socially useful purpose, but the author does not state that people should generally not be protected against such risks.
  Statement B focuses on the views of policy experts and is not a statement that the author would necessarily agree or disagree with.
  Statement C is not discussed in the passage.
  Statement D reflects the author's argument that judgments about voluntary and involuntary risks may not be useful in guiding policy decisions.
  Statement E makes a claim about the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily, but the passage does not support this claim.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The author argues against the use of 'voluntary' and 'involuntary' risk as criteria for regulatory policy.
The government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
The author emphasizes that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary."
The author argues that the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily.
Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that aligns with their argument that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction, and that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author thinks the distinction of voluntary and involuntary risk is not helpful in guiding policy decisions.
  People's judgments about voluntariness often stem from confusion and selective attention.
  The government should save as many lives as possible while considering public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  The author does not believe that people should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  The author also does not agree that voluntariness is irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  The author doesn't provide information to support answer choice C.
  The author argues that the government should deem a risk voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  The author doesn't provide information to support answer choice E.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not very useful for policy decisions.
  The author also believes that the government should try to save as many lives as possible using the resources available to them. 
  Therefore, the author is most likely to agree with the statement that supports this belief.
  Choice A is incorrect because the author does not explicitly state that dangerous activities serve no socially useful purpose.
  Choice B is incorrect because the author argues that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, but laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily.
  Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not provide evidence to support this statement.
  Choice D is correct because the author argues that the concept of voluntariness is not clear-cut and that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?
Choices:
  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes how CFCs destroy the ozone layer.
  CFCs chemically react with oxygen in the stratosphere and release chlorine.
  Chlorine reacts with ozone and destroys it while regenerating the chlorine atom.
  As a result, reducing the use of CFCs can help to protect the ozone layer.
  The passage also mentions that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer increases the exposure to ultraviolet radiation and thus increases the risk of skin cancer.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs can contribute indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.

  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the role of CFCs in depleting the ozone layer and the resulting increase in ultraviolet radiation that reaches the earth's surface.
  It does not suggest that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present. In fact, the passage states that "natural production and destruction of the gas" should be in equilibrium.
  The passage supports the statement that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light, as it discusses how ultraviolet radiation from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  The passage discusses the role of CFCs in releasing chlorine in the upper atmosphere, but it does not suggest that few other chemicals can do so.
  The passage suggests that regulating the use of CFCs can help protect the ozone layer, which in turn can help lower the incidence of skin cancer. However, it does not directly state that regulating CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  The passage does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

  The depletion of the ozone layer leaves the earth's surface more exposed to ultraviolet radiation.
  Ultraviolet radiation from the sun is known to contribute to skin cancer.
  Regulating the use of CFCs would limit the depletion of the ozone layer.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs can contribute indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage describes the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer, which is a shield against ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
  Chlorine atoms, which are produced by the breakdown of CFCs, react with ozone molecules in a way that destroys ozone and regenerates chlorine.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage starts by discussing the two theories neurobiologists once believed in about how communication between neurons is possible. 
  It then goes on to discuss how the alternative theory of chemical transmission has gradually won acceptance, but for a long time, little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. 
  It then describes new evidence that shows the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. 
  Finally, the passage discusses how this discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Thus, the primary purpose of the passage is to discuss new support for a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception
  D: questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted and what they depict.
FMRI scans show the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
The baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to give the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
The method used for interpreting FMRI scans is most analogous to which one of the following?
Option A: is not similar to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Option B: is not similar to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Option C: is not similar to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Option D: is not similar to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Option E: is not similar to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Therefore, none of the options are analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is by subtracting a baseline measurement from a second measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  This method is used to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The method subtracts out all the distributed brain functions, giving a false impression of neat functional localization.
  Therefore, the answer should be an option that describes a method that isolates one variable to better understand its impact.
  Option B describes a method where an increase in shoppers was only observed during the summer due to the yearlong advertising campaign.
  This method isolates the impact of the advertisements on summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from a second measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  This method is used to determine which parts of the brain are active during the cognitive task in question.
  The method subtracts out all the other distributed brain functions and gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The question asks us to identify an analogy to the way FMRI scans are typically interpreted.
  Choice (B) describes a store that launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer.
  The advertisements affected only the summer shoppers because there was no increase in shoppers during the other seasons.
  This is analogous to the way FMRI scans subtract out all the other distributed brain functions to determine which parts of the brain are active during the cognitive task in question.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
FMRI scans use a subtractive method to account for the fact that the entire brain is active in both control and on-task conditions.
The FMRI scan shows the differential rate of oxygen use between the two conditions.
This differential rate of oxygen use is used to isolate the metabolic activity that is associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
The subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but obscures the fact that the entire brain is active.
An analogous situation will involve a parameter that affects the entirety of a system, but only highlights a particular aspect.
Option A: One district has voted in an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
Option B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Option C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
Option D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
Option E: The cheetah is the world's fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Option A, B, C, and E do not involve a parameter that affects the entirety of a system, but only highlights a particular aspect.
Option D is the most analogous since it involves a parameter (i.e., time of day) that affects the entirety of a system (i.e., internet traffic), but only highlights a particular aspect (i.e., location of origin during peak hours).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage explains how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  FMRI scans use a subtractive method to reveal metabolic activity associated with a specific cognitive task by subtracting baseline measurement in the control condition.

  Choice B is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice C is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice D is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice E is analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans because it describes a situation where the cheetah's fastest land animal only applies to short distances, and most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances, which is similar to how the FMRI scans only reveal metabolic activity associated with a specific cognitive task by subtracting baseline measurement in the control condition, obscuring the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage describes that the brain scans show the differential rate of oxygen use between control and on-task measurement.
  The other options are not quite analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  Option A is about the vote margin in one particular district. 
  Option B is about the advertisement campaign that affects only summer shoppers.
  Option C is about the water supply used by different sectors.
  Option D is about the origin of Internet traffic during peak hours.
  Option E is about the speed of cheetahs over short and long distances.
  None of these options describe the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.

Response 6:
Thought:
The passage describes the way in which FMRI scans are interpreted. 
An FMRI scan is a differential measurement, and what remains after subtraction is believed to be associated solely with the cognitive task. 
The question asks for an analogous situation.
Option A describes how one district's voting preferences affected the outcome of an election.
Option B describes how a year-long advertising campaign only affected summer shoppers.
Option C describes how the agricultural sector is more impacted by droughts than the residential sector.
Option D describes how most Internet traffic during peak hours originates from homes rather than office buildings.
Option E describes how cheetahs can only run at their top speed for short distances.
None of these options seems to be analogous to how FMRI scans are interpreted.

Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage describes how FMRI scans of brain activity are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement to reveal what is associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The other choices describe different scenarios or analogies that are not related to FMRI scans.
  Choice A is about a particular district that voted for a mayor, and choice B is about a store's advertising campaign.
  Choice C is about water supply usage between agricultural and residential customers, and choice D is about Internet traffic during peak hours.
  Choice E is about how cheetahs are only the fastest land animal for short distances.
  Therefore, none of the choices are analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted as a subtraction of a baseline measurement from a second measurement while a subject is performing a cognitive task.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The method produces striking images of the brain at work.
  The question asks for an analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice A is not analogous because it describes a single district that is crucial to the election of a mayor rather than a subtraction process.
  Choice B is not analogous because it describes an increase in shoppers rather than a subtraction process.
  Choice C is not analogous because it describes a comparison of water usage between two types of customers rather than a subtraction process.
  Choice D is not analogous because it describes a comparison of Internet traffic between two types of locations rather than a subtraction process.
  Choice E is not analogous because it describes the speed of cheetahs over short distances rather than a subtraction process.
  None of the choices are analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted as a result of a subtraction of baseline measurements from on-task measurements.
  The baseline measurements are subtracted from on-task measurements to produce an image that is interpreted as representing metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and it gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The question asks for an analogy to this method of interpretation.
  Option A: the fact that one district voted for a mayor by an unusually large margin is interpreted as the reason the mayor won.
  Option B: an advertisement campaign that increased the number of shoppers in a store during the summer is interpreted as affecting only the summer shoppers.
  Option C: the fact that agricultural customers use more water than residential customers is interpreted as the reason the agricultural sector is impacted the most when droughts occur.
  Option D: the fact that Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours is interpreted as originating in homes rather than in office buildings.
  Option E: the fact that cheetahs are the world's fastest land animal only for short distances is interpreted as most cheetahs cannot outrun another animal over long distances.
  None of the options seem to be analogous to the method of interpretation of FMRI scans as described in the passage.
  Option A is about an unusually large margin of votes to explain a win.
  Option B is about an advertisement campaign affecting only the summer shoppers.
  Option C is about the agricultural sector being impacted the most during droughts.
  Option D is about the peak hours of the Internet traffic originating in homes.
  Option E is about cheetahs being the fastest land animal only for short distances.
  None of these options relate to the fact that the FMRI scans are interpreted as a result of a subtraction of baseline measurements from on-task measurements, which produces a false impression of neat functional localization.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The critics in the second paragraph argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are value-laden and the choice of these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  According to this objection, genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless the culture is studied from its own cultural perspective.
  Therefore, the critics who raise this objection would most likely agree with choice E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
The critics argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective and the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
This suggests that the critics believe that the methods of Western science are not best suited for studying non-Western cultures.
The answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:

  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value-laden and are a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  Critics argue that to insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.
  The answer should be an option that aligns with the critics' position in the given context.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
The critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. They argue that each culture should be taken on its own terms. The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western, which involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. 
Option A and Option B are general statements about the social and historical circumstances of a culture. Option C is partly correct but not the best answer to the question. Option D is not true because genuine understanding of another culture is still possible even if that culture does not share the same cultural values. Option E is not the answer as it is not what the critics would be most likely to agree with.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that understanding of other cultures is impossible if approached solely through the methods of Western science.
  The objection proposes that genuine understanding of other cultures can only be achieved if the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied are adopted.
  The objection doesn't mention the impossibility of understanding a culture's values if those values are different from one's own.
  Choice A is incorrect.
  The objection does mention that the social and historical circumstances of a culture are important in understanding that culture's values.
  Choice B aligns with this idea and is a possible answer.
  The objection doesn't mention the necessity of multiple cultural perspectives to understand another culture.
  Choice C is incorrect.
  The objection proposes that genuine understanding of another culture can only be achieved if the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied are adopted, but doesn't mention the necessity of sharing the same cultural values to achieve understanding.
  Choice D is incorrect.
  The objection mentions that the values of liberalism can't be adequately understood if approached solely through the methods of Western science.
  Choice E is incorrect.
  The best answer is B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
The critics of the second proposal of multicultural education believe that the Western scientific heritage is value-laden and that the methods of social-scientific examination of other cultures involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Therefore, they do not believe that it is possible to understand and appreciate other cultures if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. The objection that they raise is that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second proposal of multicultural education are still identifiably Western, which makes it difficult to achieve real understanding of other cultures. 
Option A is incorrect because it states that members of different cultures cannot understand the social and historical circumstances that give rise to another culture's values. The critics of the second proposal argue that understanding other cultures is possible but requires one to take on their own terms.
Option B may be correct, but it does not directly relate to the objection raised by the critics of the second proposal of multicultural education.
Option C may be reasonable, but it is not directly related to the objection raised by the critics of the second proposal of multicultural education.
Option D is incorrect. The critics of the second proposal of multicultural education believe that genuine understanding of other cultures is possible, even if those cultures do not share the same cultural values.
Option E is in line with the objection raised by the critics of the second proposal of multicultural education. They argue that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science. 
Therefore, the correct answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science. Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
The objection in the second paragraph argues that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western, therefore, they are value laden. 
The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden as they are derived from the Western scientific perspective. 
The Western scientific heritage prizes the objective over the subjective.
Thus, critics of this objection would most likely agree that the social and historical circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
The answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The objection in the second paragraph is that the second version of multicultural education, which proposes to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, is not essentially different from the first version. 
  This objection argues that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value laden as they are derived from the Western scientific perspective and heritage.
  The objection claims that to insist on understanding nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. 
  The objection does not mention any of the choices explicitly, but it implies that the second version of multicultural education is distorting and Eurocentric, so it is not essentially different from the first version which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture.
  Therefore, the most likely choice that critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would agree with is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Passage B differs from passage A in that analogous displays an attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more
Choices:
  A: engaged
  B: dismissive
  C: detached
  D: ironic
  E: skeptical
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that neuroscience suggests that the concept of free will is an illusion and that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  Passage B introduces the concept of soft determinism, which contends that an action is free as long as it is not constrained and distinguishes between free and constrained actions, with only constrained actions being unfree.
  Both passages discuss the relationship between neuroscience and the idea of free will, but their approaches are different.
  Passage A is dismissive of the concept of free will, while Passage B is more engaged and attempts to reconcile determinism and free will.
  The answer is A: engaged.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is still value-laden and distorting because it uses Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures.
  To object to this criticism, it would need to be shown that the use of Western scientific methods is not value-laden or distorting.
  Choice A is not relevant to the criticism.
  Choice B is not relevant to the criticism.
  Choice C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying other cultures, which could potentially weaken the criticism if it could be shown that this approach is effective in achieving genuine understanding.
  Choice D is not relevant to the criticism.
  Choice E is already assumed in the passage and does not provide a new objection to the criticism.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, which weakens the criticism that the second version of multicultural education is necessarily value-laden. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The second version of multicultural education is criticized for being based on Western scientific methods.
  Critics argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden.
  The objection is that the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first because it is also based on Western scientific methods and perspectives.
  To counter this criticism, we need to find a statement that provides evidence that the second version of multicultural education is essentially different from the first version.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education because it does not address the issue of methods or perspectives.
  Choice C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values. However, this does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Choice E is consistent with the criticism of the second version of multicultural education but does not provide evidence to counter the criticism.
  None of the choices provides a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first because it still adopts Western scientific perspectives and heritage.
  The objection is that it is distorting and maintains a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  The question asks for the strongest objection to this criticism.
  Choice A does not provide a strong objection because it does not address the main issue.
  Choice B is irrelevant because the question is not about the similarities or differences between non-Western societies.
  Choice C does not provide a strong objection because it is already acknowledged in the passage that there are non-Western societies that use their own value system when studying cultures.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it is not related to the main issue of adopting Western scientific perspectives and heritage in studying other cultures.
  Choice E is a strong objection because it supports the argument that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, which is the main issue in the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is still Western-centric.
  The objection is that non-Western cultures cannot be understood by the methods of Western science.
  The passage suggests that one way to achieve real understanding is by adopting non-scientific perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  The strongest objection would be an argument against the view that non-scientific perspectives and methods are necessary for real understanding.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the objection.
  Choice B does not address the Western-centric criticism.
  Choice C opposes the second version of multicultural education, not the objection.
  Choice D is irrelevant.
  Choice E is not relevant to the objection.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity, which is already present in Western scientific methods.
  Adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is necessary for real understanding.
  Therefore, an option that supports that adopting different methods is necessary would provide the strongest objection to the criticism. 
  Option A is irrelevant as it suggests impossibility.
  Option B is also irrelevant as it suggests similarity.
  Option C is partially related to the issue, but does not provide a strong objection.
  Option D is also irrelevant as it talks about Western achievements.
  Option E is not a strong objection as it is already suggested in the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it still approaches other cultures with Western scientific methods.
  The objection to this criticism is that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for appreciating it adequately.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would be evidence that adopting a non-Western perspective is not necessary for genuine understanding.
  Choice A, B, C, and E do not provide a strong objection to the criticism.
  Choice D suggests that Western scientific investigations are necessary for understanding Western culture's achievements.
  Therefore, if true, choice D would provide the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is still using Western scientific methods to examine non-scientific cultures.
  The objection is that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting non-scientific perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  If one of the answer choices suggests that using Western scientific methods is not a problem, it would provide the strongest objection.
  Answer choice A is not relevant to the criticism.
  Answer choice B is not relevant to the criticism.
  Answer choice C is not relevant to the criticism.
  Answer choice D is not relevant to the criticism.
  Answer choice E is consistent with the criticism.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education is not among the answer choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage argues that the second version of multicultural education is criticized because it uses Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures, which are often value-laden and distorting.
  To provide the strongest objection, we need to find a statement that refutes this criticism.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, as similarities between non-Western societies does not address the use of Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, as it only describes what some non-Western societies do, but does not address the use of Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, as it is not related to the criticism of using Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures.
  Choice E is also not a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, as it is an assertion that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary, but it does not refute the criticism of using Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures.
  Therefore, none of the choices provide a strong objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it adopts Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures which is not adequate.
  The strongest objection to the criticism would be to show that the second version of multicultural education can adequately understand other cultures even with Western scientific methods.
  Option A is irrelevant to the objection.
  Option B talks about similarities between non-Western societies but doesn't address the objection.
  Option C talks about some non-Western societies that use their own value system, but it doesn't address how well the second version of multicultural education can understand other cultures.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the objection.
  Option E supports the criticism.
  Therefore, none of the options provide the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that the examination of other cultures is value-laden and distorting due to the methods of social-scientific examination that derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage.
  The objection is that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied can lead to real understanding.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would be an argument that the adoption of non-scientific perspectives and methods to study other cultures is unnecessary or detrimental to achieving real understanding.
  Choice A is irrelevant because the passage does not discuss adopting the perspectives and methods of other cultures.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because the similarities between non-Western societies' value systems do not address the objection to the scientific perspective and methods.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it only acknowledges that some non-Western societies use their own value system to study other cultures, but it does not address the objection to the scientific perspective and methods.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it discusses a different topic, i.e. understanding a culture's achievements.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it only restates the importance of genuine understanding of another culture.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
Response 0:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses the objections of critics to version two of multicultural education.
  Critics argue that version two is not different from version one.
  This is because the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in version 2 are still Western.
  Critics argue that Western scientific heritage is already value-laden.
  Therefore, the choice to examine and understand other cultures by Western scientific methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  Critics also argue that trying to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting but also an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Given this information, the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The third paragraph talks about the criticisms of the second version of multicultural education.
  According to critics, the second version of multicultural education is not different from the first version because the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version are still identifiably Western.
  Critics argue that the Western scientific heritage is a privileged place in Western cultures and using these methods to understand non-scientific cultures is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, according to proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would most likely be considered objectionable.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage describes two different versions of multicultural education. 
  The proponents of the second version of multicultural education believe that each culture should be taken on its own terms. 
  However, its methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western. 
  Critics of this version argue that these methods are already value-laden and do not reflect the perspectives of non-Western cultures.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education, the first emphasizing Western values, and the second emphasizing cultural neutrality. 
  The third paragraph argues that the second version is not essentially different from the first because the methods used to study non-Western cultures are still Western. 
  Critics argue that attempting to understand non-scientific cultures through Western science is not only distorting, but also an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, the third version, which involves using Western methods to understand non-scientific cultures, would be objectionable to proponents of the second version of multicultural education.
  Choice C describes a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The third paragraph talks about the objection to the second version of multicultural education.
  The objection is that Western scientific methods are not adequate to understand non-scientific cultures.
  According to the proponents of the second version of multicultural education, each culture should be taken on its own terms.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education, which adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but uses Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures.
  The objections to this version are that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures involve a commitment to certain values such as objectivity, which is a privileged place in Western cultures but often not the dominant form of thought and language of non-Western cultures.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that proponents of this version of multicultural education would object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.

  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage.
  Critics of this second version argue that the Western scientific heritage is already value-laden and that these methods are distorting.
  To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, the answer would be a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture, which is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses extensively that CJD is inevitably fatal. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author would agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  The author discusses in detail the discovery of the link between prions and CJD and the fact that prions reproduce without nucleic acid. Thus, the author would be likely to agree with the statements that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  The author also discusses the fact that prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. Thus, it is unlikely that the author would agree that the body has a natural defense against CJD.
  The author mentions that prions exhibiting an abnormal conformation reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. Thus, the author would be likely to agree with the statement that the scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, so it is unlikely that the author would agree with an option that implies otherwise.
  All other options are mentioned or implied in the passage.
  Option B directly contradicts information in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal and there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
  The passage also states that prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  The author would likely disagree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage describes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which is inevitably fatal.
  One of the characteristics of CJD is the presence of abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue.
  The passage states that "there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses," which suggests that not all patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  The passage describes how prions can reproduce themselves without nucleic acid.
  The passage states that the body does not produce an immune response to prions because they occur naturally.
  The passage also states that "the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood."
  Therefore, the author would be LEAST likely to agree with B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage describes how prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.
  The passage describes the pathogenesis of CJD and the role of prions in the disease.
  The passage describes the characteristics of prions.
  The author is most likely to agree that prions are infectious, cause neurological disease, are protein-based, do not require nucleic acid, the body does not produce an immune response to prions, and that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
  The author is least likely to agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease because CJD is inevitably fatal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that CJD is inevitably fatal.
  Thus, it is reasonable to say that the author would not agree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease. 
  The author agrees that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction since the passage explains that prions do not have nucleic acid. 
  The author also explains that the body does not produce an immune response against prions, so the author would agree that the body has no natural defense against CJD.
  The author also states that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
  The passage states that prions in brain tissue can cause neurological disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal.
  The passage also states that prions are not affected by the body's immune system.
  The discovery of prions was initially met with skepticism, but subsequent research supported the conclusion that prions are a new class of pathogens.
  The author would be least likely to agree with a statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage.
  Thus, the author would not agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The author discusses the characteristics of prions, their link to CJD, and the fact that prions are a new class of infectious pathogens.
  The author also mentions that CJD is inevitably fatal with no effective therapy.
  Based on this information, it can be inferred that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with choice B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage describes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans caused by a pathogen called prion.
  Prions are a type of protein pathogen that do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  Prions reproduce and cause cellular destruction by initiating a chain reaction.
  The body does not produce an immune response to prions because they occur naturally in the body as proteins.
  CJD is inevitably fatal and there are no effective therapies for preventing the progression of the disease.
  The author would be least likely to agree with a statement that contradicts one of these facts.
  Statement B contradicts the fact that CJD is inevitably fatal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal and there is no effective therapy for it.
  The passage clearly explains that prions are pathogenic proteins that cause CJD and that they do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  The passage does not mention anything about patients with CJD recovering from the disease.
  The passage states that prions occur naturally in the body and the body does not produce an immune response against them.
  The passage states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce are not yet completely understood.
  Therefore, the author would be LEAST likely to agree with B, "Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease," since the passage already stated that CJD is inevitably fatal.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle holds that individuals make rational economic choices by selecting actions that maximize their expected overall satisfaction.
  Expected overall satisfaction is calculated by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  The question is asking for the least appropriate example of a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  All of the responses involve rational decisions made based on economic incentives and disincentives.
  However, one of the responses does not involve a deliberate crime or illegal activity, which is the main topic of the passage.
  Answer: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
The utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. 
An economic choice is where a person chooses between various options based on a cost-benefit analysis.
The example that would not be considered rational is the least likely to lead to a cost-benefit analysis. 
Option E describes a situation where an individual is impulsive and acts without considering the costs and benefits.
Therefore, the answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
The utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. To answer this question, we need to find the least appropriate response to economic incentives and disincentives.
A: A waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government to reduce his taxes. This is a rational response to economic incentives because he seeks to maximize his utility.
B: A motorist avoids speeding because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license. This is a rational response to economic disincentives because she seeks to avoid the negative utility caused by losing her driver's license.
C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river, believing the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant. This is a rational response to economic disincentives because he seeks to minimize the cost of keeping his plant operational and maximize his profits.
D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. This is a rational response to economic incentives because she seeks to maximize the utility of her and her family.
E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives, as it does not seek to maximize the expected utility of his actions, but rather acts on impulse and emotions.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle suggests that people make rational decisions based on the expected utility of each option.
  Rational decisions are based on a cost-benefit analysis of the outcomes of each option.
  The option that provides the greatest benefit is the one that maximizes utility.
  The cost or benefit can be in the form of incentives or disincentives, and can be economic or non-economic.
  Therefore, the least appropriate rational response to economic incentives or disincentives would be the one that violates the principle of cost-benefit analysis.
  Of the given choices, choice E involves an impulsive crime of assault that is not well-thought-out.
  Therefore, the least appropriate rational response to economic incentives and disincentives would be E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage explains the utility maximization principle, which is that people take actions that maximize their overall satisfaction.
  The principle is based on weighing the utilities of the possible outcomes of an action and their likelihood.
  The passage also explains that people make rational economic choices based on the expected utility of those choices.
  All of the choices involve economic incentives and disincentives and the rational response to them.
  However, the passage suggests that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  Choice E involves an impulsive crime instead of a deliberate crime.
  The other choices involve deliberate crimes and the rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Therefore, the least appropriate choice described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is E, a worker physically assaulting his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
Expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action and weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
The passage says that a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
A: The waiter believes that the government is unlikely to detect him and that he will not be penalized. He is making a rational decision based on the probability of getting caught.
B: The motorist is avoiding speeding because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that she will lose her driver's license if caught. She is making a rational decision based on the cost of getting caught.
C: The industrialist has decided to continue discharging pollutants into the river because the cost of treatment is much higher than the fine for discharging the pollutant. The decision is based on a rational economic calculation.
D: The government official is risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because her government salary is inadequate to support her and her family. She is making a decision based on a rational economic calculation.
E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor because he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The economic principle of utility maximization suggests that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  All of the choices involve some rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Therefore, the least appropriate response to economic incentives and disincentives would be the one that does not involve a rational decision that maximizes the expected utility of an action.
  Choice E is the only one that suggests an impulsive action that is not based on a rational calculation of expected utility.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Rational individuals respond to economic incentives or disincentives.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  The expected utility from a crime will decrease if the likelihood of getting caught and punished increases.
  Therefore, rational individuals will not commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, is less than the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  Choice A describes a situation where an individual decides to hide her income to reduce her taxes.
  Choice B describes a situation where an individual avoids speeding to prevent the loss of her driver's license.
  Choice C describes a situation where an industrialist continues to pollute a river because the cost of treatment is high.
  Choice D describes a situation where a government official solicits bribes due to inadequate income.
  Choice E describes a situation where a worker physically assaults his former supervisor.
  All the choices describe an individual's rational response to economic incentives or disincentives except for choice E, because assaulting someone is an impulsive crime and not a rational response to an economic incentive or disincentive.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that a rational individual will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  An action that would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives would be one where the expected utility does not match what the individual chooses to do.
  Option A describes a waiter who conceals his tip income to reduce his taxes, the expected utility being avoiding paying extra taxes and the chance of being caught is very low.
  Option B describes a motorist who avoids speeding on a road, the expected utility being avoiding losing her driver's license, and the likelihood of being caught is high.
  Option C describes an industrialist who continues to illegally discharge pollutants into a river, the expected utility being the cost of treatment outweighing the fine for illegal discharge.
  Option D describes a government official who risks prosecution for soliciting bribes, the expected utility being rampant inflation making her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  Option E describes a worker who assaults his former supervisor, the expected utility not matching what the worker chooses to do.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described action is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle suggests that an individual will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.
  The principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  A rational response to economic incentives or disincentives is one that maximizes the individual's anticipated overall satisfaction.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is the one that does not maximize the individual's anticipated overall satisfaction.
  Option A describes a person who decides to conceal his tip income from the government to reduce his taxes because he thinks it is unlikely that he will be detected and penalized. This decision maximizes his anticipated overall satisfaction, so it is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option B describes a person who avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license. This decision maximizes her anticipated overall satisfaction, so it is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option C describes an industrialist who continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant. This decision maximizes his profits, so it is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option D describes a government official in an impoverished country who risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. This decision maximizes her income, so it is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option E describes a worker who physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This decision does not maximize his anticipated overall satisfaction and could lead to punishment, so it is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.
  D: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  E: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Schoenberg's music evolved through three different styles.
  The first style is described as being late-Romantic music.
  The second style is described as being tonal music without a tonal basis.
  The third style is described as being a 12-tone technique used to bring a new system of order to nontonal music.
  The author notes that in all three styles, Schoenberg operated at a high level of technical mastery, but that his music became more difficult to follow as his career progressed.
  The passage does not suggest that any of these styles are inexplicable departures from previous ones.
  The passage does suggest that each style represents a natural progression from the one before it.
  Based on this, the most likely answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
- The passage describes the three musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.

- Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement A: each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes the evolution of Schoenberg's musical style through three different stages.
  The first style is late-Romantic, charged with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style pushes those unstable harmonies until they no longer have a tonal basis and becomes nontonal.
  The third style uses the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilize it.
  The passage does not seem to suggest that Schoenberg's styles represent inexplicable departures from previous ones.
  Rather, the passage describes each style as a natural progression from the previous one, culminating in a musical style that precisely delineates emotional states not previously recorded in music.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how Schoenberg's music evolved through three different styles.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two ways art was produced for the elite historically.
  The sociohistorical interpretation of art produced for the elite is discussed and the limitations of this interpretation are mentioned.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class was not always apt to produce art that endures.
  Some artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment.
  Art that went against the grain of elite values was sometimes paid for by the establishment with misgivings.
  The sociohistorical critic must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  The main point of the passage is that there have been limitations to the sociohistorical interpretation of art produced for the elite and the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite, because the elite's tastes were not always apt to produce art that endures and artists were sometimes able to subvert their patrons' ideals.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:

The passage also argues that some of the art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
The main point of the passage is about the historical ways of producing art by the elite, the limitations of sociohistorical interpretations, and how certain artworks were created despite conflicting values.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two different ways historically art was produced by and for political and social elites.
  Sociohistorical critics only focus on the second way, where the art mirrors the ideals and way of life of the elite class.
  The sociohistorical analysis of such art needs to eliminate the possibility of artists subverting the ideals of their patrons.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
  The sociohistorical critic must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis to justify their claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that there have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them, and sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify their claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
Action: Answer("E")

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses two ways that art has been produced by and for political and social elites.
  The first way is to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display, and the second way is to create a work that expresses and mirrors one's ideals and way of life.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce art that endures.
  The sociohistorical critic prefers to deal with the second way art is produced because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  This requires showing that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  The sociohistorical critic must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis to claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: The author refers. to the early days of biotechnology (line 38) primarily in order to
Choices:
  A: furnish a brief account of the evolution of academic biotechnology research

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)
  B: "highly diverse" (line 10)
  C: "markedly inclusive" (line 16)
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24)
  E: "alien to the European style" (line 51)

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The author connects the idea of monopoly power to the size of a business.
  The author suggests that diminishing returns to scale are needed for the Invisible Hand to work properly.
  If the correct answer choice shows that there can be larger businesses without monopoly power, then the connection between size and monopoly power would be undermined.
  Choice A does not address the impact of size on competition.
  Choice B does not address the connection between size and monopoly power.
  Choice C reinforces the connection between size and monopoly power.
  Choice D suggests that the relationship between size and monopoly power may vary by industry rather than being a general rule.
  Choice E does not address the connection between size and monopoly power.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The author also argues that the invisible hand can only work properly when there are many competitors in each industry.
  If there are situations where large businesses do not have monopoly power despite increasing returns to scale, it would undermine the connection the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author suggests that increasing returns can lead to natural monopoly.
  The invisible hand requires many competitors to work properly.
  Diminishing returns keep many competitors in each industry.
  The Pin Factory and increasing returns are hard to represent mathematically.
  The Pin Factory in economics thought began to become mainstream in the late 1970s.
  To undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, it would be necessary to show that increasing returns can still lead to many competitors in each industry.
  Options A, C, and E do not challenge the idea that increasing returns lead to natural monopoly, which is why they are not the correct answer.
  Option B does not address the issue of many competitors in each industry.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly because larger businesses can achieve lower costs than smaller businesses. 
  To counteract this natural tendency toward monopoly, there must be many competitors in each industry. 
  If it were true that some industries have businesses that can exert monopoly power in one region despite the presence of larger businesses in other regions, it would suggest that the connection between increased size and monopoly power is not as strong as the author claims. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly, but the invisible hand works properly only if there are many competitors in each industry.
  The author implies that the natural tendency toward monopoly is undermined if there are many competitors in each industry, even if increasing returns to scale are present.
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would most undermine this connection.
  A, B, C, and E do not directly undermine this connection. 
  D could undermine this connection because if the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, then the connection between increased size and monopoly power would not be as strong as the author implies. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author argues that the Pin Factory leads to increasing returns to scale, which in turn leads to natural monopoly.
  The author argues that free markets get it right only when there are many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Therefore, the author's argument is based on the assumption that returns to scale are increasing, not diminishing.
  To undermine this connection, we need to provide evidence that suggests returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  Choice D states that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  If true, this suggests that some industries may not be able to achieve natural monopoly power even if they have achieved increasing returns to scale.
  This would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power that the author draws in the context.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power.
  The author argues that the invisible hand works best with many competitors in each industry.
  Therefore, to undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, we need to show that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopolies or that the invisible hand can still work with few competitors.
  Choice A does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it describes local monopolies.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C reinforces the argument by stating that businesses collude in order to set prices as high as monopolies.
  Choice D could potentially undermine the argument because it suggests that not all businesses can achieve increasing returns to scale, but it does not provide evidence that large businesses with increasing returns do not lead to monopolies.
  Choice E could potentially undermine the argument because it suggests that productivity gains from specialization could be offset by other factors, but it does not provide evidence that increasing returns to scale do not lead to monopolies.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  One of the assumptions of the invisible hand is that many competitors are present in each industry.
  Therefore, if there is no connection between increased size and monopoly power, it would undermine the author's argument.
  Choice A, C, and E do not undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice B provides information about the worker's salary rather than the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice D suggests that there is no fixed size that a business must reach in order to achieve increasing returns to scale.
  If there is no fixed size, then it may be possible that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale tend to lead to monopoly power.
  If there are factors that would undermine this connection, then the author's argument would be weakened.
  A, C, and E do not address the relationship between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
  B suggests a drawback of specialization, but does not address the relationship of increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
  D, however, suggests that the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale varies by industry, which suggests that not all industries will lead to monopoly power.
  Therefore, D would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
The author explains that increasing returns tend to create a natural tendency toward monopoly because larger firms can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller firms. The author also explains that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. The correct answer choice would suggest that there is no necessary connection between increased size and monopoly power.
A: This answer choice suggests that larger businesses may not necessarily achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller businesses, but it does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
B: This answer choice is irrelevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This answer choice supports the idea that larger firms can achieve monopoly power. 
D: This answer choice suggests that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, which does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:
Thought:
The author argues that digital publication has eliminated physical inventory costs, shipping costs, and various other expenses that come with traditional publishing. 
Therefore, it is most likely that "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) refers to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author mentions the elimination of costs irrelevant to digital publication.
  The author mentions that the elimination of "whole categories of expense" means that authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product.
  The author suggests that these "whole categories of expense" make up a significant portion of publishers' revenue.
  Therefore, the author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" to refer to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
The paragraph is discussing the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of digital publishing.
The paragraph mentions several costs that are eliminated by digital publishing, which leads to a lower publishing cost.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.

  The passage explains that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, and some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will restrict access to them. However, the author argues that this fear is misplaced and granting a patent does not imply granting the right to deny access. In reality, patent litigation is expensive and typically only initiated to protect a market position or exclusive patent license. Moreover, patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Thought:
  In Passage A, it is mentioned that auxiliary premises appeal to "the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc."
  In Passage B, the astronomers based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers hypothesized about the existence of another planet, Vulcan, to account for the failure of their predictions about the orbit of Mercury.
  Vulcan could be considered a disturbing force because it was hypothesized to be affecting the orbit of Mercury in unexpected ways.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage B describes the attempts of scientists to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  Scientists later found that the assumption was incorrect and that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Scientists also hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Mercury to explain the failure of their prediction.
  Both Uranus and Mercury have other celestial objects in their vicinity.
  Therefore, these objects may cause disturbing forces.
  The answer is NOT A, B, C, or E since they are not directly related to the concept of disturbing forces as described in passage A.
  The most likely answer is D: Mercury.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A describes that scientists almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc.
  Passage B describes the astronomers' predictions of the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions.
  The other planets mentioned in Passage B (Neptune and Mercury) do not clearly illustrate a disturbing force.
  The moon is not mentioned in Passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is not clearly stated in the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  According to passage A, auxiliary premises may appeal to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc.
  In passage B, the astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Therefore, the disturbing force in this case might be another planet in the vicinity of Uranus.
  The answer is C: Neptune.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The question refers to Passage A (lines 26-27).
  According to Passage A, auxiliary premises are often needed to derive a theory's predictions and they may include the absence of disturbing forces.
  Passage B describes the discovery of Uranus and Neptune and the attempts to predict their orbits.
  It is unlikely that Uranus, the sun, Neptune, or Mercury are "disturbing forces" as the term is used in Passage A. 
  The moon is not mentioned in Passage B; it is not relevant to the question.
  The reference to "disturbing forces" in Passage A seems to imply unexpected factors that may disrupt or complicate the predicted outcome.
  Based on the information in Passage B, the discovery of Neptune and its gravitational effects on Uranus may be the best example of a "disturbing force".
  The answer is C: Neptune.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question refers us to Passage A (line 26), where Popper introduces the notion of additional premises that scientists use to explain their predictions and experimental results, including the correct functioning of instrumentation and the absence of disturbing forces.
  Passage B relates a story of astronomers who predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws, using auxiliary assumptions, including the assumption that there were no planets in the vicinity of Uranus.
  The astronomers found that their predictions were incorrect, and one possible reason for this was an error in the auxiliary assumptions, including the absence of planets that could be disturbing Uranus's orbit.
  Therefore, the answer should be a celestial body that could be a possible disturbing force on Mercury's orbit.
Action: Answer("D") Mercury
Response 6:
Thought:
  In Passage A, the author describes an "auxiliary" premise that scientists use to derive a theory's predictions.
  In Passage B, the astronomers used auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets to predict the orbit of Uranus.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  The astronomers found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  They changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets and concluded that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  This new planet was Neptune, which was discovered in the precise place it would have to be.
  Therefore, Neptune is the answer because it was the "disturbing force" that caused the astronomers to revise their auxiliary assumptions about the existence of other planets and their orbits, and derive new predictions that were consistent with the observations.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses how auxiliary premises can be used to support a scientific theory and how a disturbance can cause the predictions to fail.
  Passage B discusses how astronomers used auxiliary assumptions and Newton's laws to predict the orbits of Uranus and Mercury.
  In the case of Uranus, astronomers made an incorrect prediction due to an erroneous auxiliary assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. This is not a disturbing force.
  In the case of Mercury, astronomers made incorrect predictions twice using Newton's laws, which led them to hypothesize the existence of a planet named Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that there might be a disturbing force. 
  The passage does not name the disturbing force, but it emphasizes that a disturbing force was suspected because the predictions based on Newton's laws were incorrect. 
  The choices are: 
    A: Uranus - incorrect, not a disturbing force
    B: the sun - incorrect, not a disturbing force
    C: Neptune - incorrect, not a disturbing force
    D: Mercury - incorrect predictions led astronomers to hypothesize a disturbing force
    E: the moon - not mentioned in Passage B
  Therefore, the answer is D: Mercury.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A talks about the role of "auxiliary" premises in scientific predictions.
  Passage B talks about the prediction of the orbit of Uranus and Mercury, based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  Passage B also mentions the possibility of disturbing forces affecting the predictions.
  To answer the question, we need to look for an example of a disturbing force in Passage B.
  Uranus, the sun, Neptune, and Mercury are not examples of disturbing forces.
  The moon is not discussed in Passage B.
  Therefore, none of the choices matches the description of a disturbing force from Passage A.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The question refers to a specific concept mentioned in passage A.
  According to passage A, auxiliary premises can include the absence of disturbing forces. 
  The question asks which example in passage B represents a disturbing force.
  None of the celestial bodies listed in the answer choices represent a disturbing force in themselves.
  Therefore, the answer must be the option that represents a disturbing force affecting the movement of the celestial bodies.
  From the given options, the moon is the only one which represents a disturbing force (e.g., due to its gravitational pull on the other celestial bodies).

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?

  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.
  B: The primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers aud haudheld devices for reading text.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: The author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings (lines 38–43) primarily to
Choices:
  A: show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life
  B: support the claim that Lichtenstein's work was parodic in intent

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 0:
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement involves arbitrary or unpredictable enforcement of the law.
  Passage A mentions capricious enforcement as a possibility for discretionary nonenforcement but not as the central tendency.
  Legislative oversight ensures that agencies do not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is unlikely.
  The answer is not A and is not E.
  Passage A indicates that the agency must trade off the danger of punishing the innocent against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it.
  Therefore, prioritizing enforcement based on the amount of damage caused by crimes is not a likely scenario.
  The answer is not C.
  Passage A explains that rules of law are almost always overinclusive and enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs.
  The central tendency is not to punish an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one.
  Therefore, not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law is not a likely scenario.
  The answer is not D.
  Passage A explains that the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement.
  The agency must trade off the danger of punishing the innocent against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it.
  Therefore, enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws is a likely scenario.
  The answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement means enforcing the law arbitrarily.
  Passage A mentions that legislative oversight ensures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced.
  Thus, capricious enforcement is unlikely to be the central tendency.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A explains that rules of law are almost always overinclusive, so enforcing them to the letter can impose heavy social costs.
  Discretionary nonenforcement is a technique to reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion.
  Capricious enforcement is not unknown, but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is when an agency does not follow the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement involves unpredictable enforcement.
  Passage A states that legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement would involve not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  In Passage A, "capricious enforcement" is mentioned as a possibility.
  The passage explains how discretionary nonenforcement can reduce the costs of overinclusion without a corresponding increase in underinclusion.

Thought: 
  According to Passage A, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement.
  Passage A suggests that discretionary non-enforcement is a technique to reduce the costs of overinclusion.
  Passage A states that capricious enforcement is not unknown but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is not a common practice, and it is unlikely to be the central tendency of law enforcement agencies.
  The answer is B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  According to Passage A, discretionary nonenforcement can reduce the costs of overinclusion without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes).
  Capricious enforcement, which is not unknown or even rare, is not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Capricious enforcement is not defined in Passage A.
  Therefore, we need to look at the answer choices to determine what capricious enforcement involves.
Action: Answer("E")  
Response 7:
Thought: 
  "Capricious enforcement" (line 32) means arbitrary enforcement.
  Passage A suggests that the law enforcement agency does not act in a capricious way since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is not the central tendency.
  The answer is not A or E since they do not fit the definition of capricious enforcement.
  The passage does not mention C and D.
  The answer is B, which is enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws.
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that some legal scholars used the utility maximization principle to reconcile the two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  The utility maximization principle is an economic principle that applies to rational individuals and explains how they make decisions based on maximizing their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The principle is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  The principle shows that the two sides in the crime deterrence debate are not fundamentally in conflict and that an optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  None of the other answer choices relate to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about how the utility maximization principle can be used to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  This principle suggests that a rational individual will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  The two crime-deterrence methods mentioned in the passage have the same overall effect based on this principle.
  Therefore, the scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is the one where a physicist's law of optics is used to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage explains how the utility maximization principle reconciles the two positions in the crime deterrence debate. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle, a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity. The passage discusses the impact of both sides of the debate on the expected utility of criminal behavior and shows how both sides end up reducing the likelihood of committing deliberate crimes. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage discusses an economic principle, the utility maximization principle, used to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime. Using this principle, the two positions, increasing fines and penalties and rehabilitating offenders, are shown to be complementary ways of deterring crime. 
None of the answer choices seem to relate to the topic of the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage talks about how the utility maximization principle reconciles two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle suggests that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  A rational economic choice is one that maximizes the anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action and weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass.
  The passage explains that both sides of the debate have the same overall effect on deterring crime.
  Therefore, the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate is most similar to a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
  Both examples use a principle from another field to support their argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how the utility maximization principle can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  This principle is used to show that two seemingly different positions in the crime deterrence debate are complementary.
  The principle is used in a way that helps reconcile the two positions.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, or E, since these answer choices do not describe the use of a principle to reconcile seemingly different positions.
  The answer is D if the judge uses evidence from anthropology to support a decision that reconciles two seemingly different positions in a legal case.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle that rational individuals use to make choices.
  The principle entails determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of an action and weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass.
  The principle is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime and can be regarded as a rational economic choice.
  The legal scholars use the principle to suggest that increasing fines and penalties associated with criminal activity and efficacious law enforcement is the best deterrence method.
  This increases the cost to the individual if detected and punished, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime.
  This is similar to using evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
  Therefore, the answer is D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how an economic principle, the utility maximization principle, can be applied to the debate on crime deterrence strategies.

  Using this principle, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  The passage suggests that both sides of the crime deterrence debate can be reconciled by this principle.
  Therefore, the scenario that is most similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle is one in which a principle from one field is used to explain or support a concept in another field.
  Option D, a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case, seems to fit this description best.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that the physicists had increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved before they realized it.
  The passage also suggests that the physicists did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  The passage suggests that the researchers were not receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in that context.
  The passage suggests that, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner was the one who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, if the physicists conducting the experiments had more awareness of the theoretical possibility of splitting atoms or had fewer expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they may have realized they were splitting atoms sooner than they did.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: The question asks what could have reduced the amount of time for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. The passage states that physicists did not recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection. Therefore, options A, B, D, and E are not correct because they do not address the root cause of the problem. Option C is the correct answer because if the physicists had been aware of the calculations indicating it was possible to split atoms, they may have been more receptive to the possibility of it happening during the neutron bombarding experiments. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that the physicists did not recognize what they were witnessing because they were not expecting the possibility of splitting atoms.
  Therefore, if the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, it would have been more likely for them to recognize that atoms were being split.
  This would have allowed them to realize the significance of the data earlier.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved but did not understand what they were witnessing.
  Precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  Physicists had already produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to split atoms apart.
  The passage does not suggest that the research techniques used by physicists or the concentration of physicists on obtaining experimental results influenced the amount of time it took for physicists to understand what they were witnessing.
  The idea that physicists conducting experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium could have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split is not discussed in the passage.
  Choice B seems to be the most likely answer because physicists had certain expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, which prevented them from recognizing that they were splitting uranium atoms. If they had not had particular expectations from the start, they might have realized what they were witnessing more quickly.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The question asks about a potential factor that could reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize atoms were being split.
  The passage states that the physicists did not recognize what they were witnessing, even though they compiled evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  The passage also notes that the researchers were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms.
  Therefore, a factor that might have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize what was happening would be if they were more receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms.
  Answer choice C says that the physicists were not aware of the calculations indicating in principle that it was possible to split atoms. If the physicists were made aware of these calculations, they might have been more receptive to the possibility of fission and more likely to realize what they were witnessing.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  The passage explains that the physicists had already compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved but did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  The passage also explains that earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Therefore, if the physicists conducting the experiments had been aware of these calculations, they might have recognized sooner that they were splitting atoms.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that a crucial theoretical connection was required for physicists to recognize that atoms were being split.
  The passage also suggests that the researchers had been compiling increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  The passage states that the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  Therefore, if researchers were more receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission resulting from neutron-bombardment experiments, they may have realized sooner that atoms were being split. 
  Choice A provides no information on researchers' receptivity to the possibility of nuclear fission, and thus is unlikely to have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Choice B contradicts the passage, which states that researchers had a particular expectation regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  Choice C contradicts the passage, which states that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Choice D suggests a possibility that may have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split, as more results would have provided more evidence.
  Choice E is irrelevant, as the passage specifically refers to neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: More physicists concentrated on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The physicists did not recognize what they were witnessing despite compiling increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result.
  Meitner finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, if the physicists had been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, they would have been more likely to realize that atoms were being split in the experiments.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage states that the physicists were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms in the context of the neutron-bombardment experiments.
  The difficulty in identifying the products of the experiments contributed to the delay in recognizing the significance of the research.
  Therefore, a factor that would have reduced the time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split would be a change in the researchers' expectations or approach to identifying the products of their experiments.
  Choice B, which states that the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, seems to be the best option.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage indicates that physicists had increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but they did not recognize it until the crucial theoretical connection was made.
  The passage also mentions that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Therefore, if the physicists conducting the experiments had been aware of these calculations, they may have been more receptive to the possibility of atoms being split and may have recognized it sooner.
  The answer is C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory because it imputes an interest to the agent of the behavior that they are not aware of.
  This means that evolutionary psychology explains behavior by assuming that it contributes to the proliferation of genes.
  Passage A offers an example of how evolutionary psychology explains behavior as serving the interest of the propagation of genes.
  The example states that genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology's theory of explaining behavior by imputing an interest to the agent of the behavior that they are not aware of.
  The author of passage A suggests that genes may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Therefore, the assertion that best exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory."
  The author of Passage B is critical of evolutionary psychology for imputing an interest to behavior that the agent of the behavior does not acknowledge.
  An example of such imputed interest is the proliferation of genes.
  The author of Passage A discusses how genes promoting their self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  This example illustrates the kind of imputed interest that the author of Passage B criticizes.
  Therefore, the assertion from Passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory.
  The author of Passage B thinks that evolutionary psychologists explain behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not acknowledge.
  The author of Passage A talks about genes promoting their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This notion of genes being responsible for behavior may exemplify what the author of Passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses how evolutionary psychology explains behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals and the proliferation of genetic material.
  Passage B criticizes this approach as a "conspiracy theory" because it imputes an interest in the proliferation of genes that the agent of the behavior is not aware of or does not acknowledge.
  The author of Passage B argues that there are often multiple interests that could explain any given behavior, and that it is difficult to show that a particular interest explains a particular behavior.
  The assertion from Passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This is an example of how evolutionary psychology imputes an interest in the proliferation of genes to explain behavior that could also be explained by other interests.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior based on the interest of gene propagation.
  This is exemplified by an assertion in Passage A.
  The assertion should describe how evolutionary psychology explains behavior in terms of gene propagation, without the agent being aware of it.
  Choice A does not fit because it does not relate to gene propagation as an ulterior motive.
  Choice B mentions altruism but not gene propagation as an ulterior motive.
  Choice C is about altruism and not about gene propagation as an ulterior motive.
  Choice E provides the context for the development of altruistic mechanisms but does not explicitly explain the concept of a hidden motive.
  Choice D describes how genes can promote their own self-propagation through unselfish acts and this exemplifies evolutionary psychology's conspiracy theory.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory.
  Conspiracy theories explain behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
  The author implies that Evolutionary Psychology is similar to a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
  The author of Passage A explains that behavior can be explained from the standpoint of the theory of evolution.
  The author also explains that apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically selfish system.
  The idea that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish is an example of how evolutionary psychology is similar to a conspiracy theory.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question is asking for an assertion from passage A that exemplifies passage B's idea of evolutionary psychology being a conspiracy theory.
  According to passage B, evolutionary psychology is a theory that attributes hidden interests to human behavior that the agent is not aware of.
  The assertion that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish perfectly fits the description of evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A talks about evolutionary psychology and how it relates to human behavior.
  Passage B talks about evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge.
  The author of Passage B is critical of the way evolutionary psychology explained certain behaviors.
  The assertion in passage A that suggests this imputed interest is "genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish."
  The answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology tries to explain human behaviors by examining how they contribute to the reproductive success of individuals and the proliferation of genetic material.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing hidden interests (the proliferation of genes) to explain behavior.
  Passage B suggests that there are many interests that could explain behavior, and inferring a particular interest that explains a specific behavior needs to be handled with great care.
  Therefore, the assertion from Passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is the one that imputes hidden interests to explain behavior.
  The assertion that imputes hidden interests is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: According to the passage, Dunham's work in anthropology differed from that of most other anthropologists in the 1930s in that Dunham

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.
  B: It serves as the author's logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.
  C: It forms part of a speculative hypothesis that the author presents for its interest in relation to the main topic rather than as part of an argument.
  D: It serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.
  E: It forms part of the author's concession that certain factors complicate the argument presented in the first two paragraphs.
Response 0:
Thought:
The reference to maximization of financial success is talking about entrepreneurs and investors needing to expand their market to maximize their financial success. They do this by structuring their prices so that their technology is accessible to a larger share of the population. This is done to increase their market share, which ultimately drives prices down. This process is part of a general tendency of the market system.
Option A states that it's part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from technological developments, but this is not accurate as the reference is not summarizing the benefits.
Option B states that it's the author's logical conclusion from the data presented, but this is not accurate as the reference is part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph.
Option C states that it's part of a speculative hypothesis, but this is not accurate as the reference is part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph.
Option D correctly states that it serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.
Option E is not accurate as there is no concession being made.
Therefore, the answer is D: It serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that some researchers fear that the corporation holding the patent will try to prevent further research by suing for patent infringement, but that judges have respected a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement in the past.
  The passage also states that patents provide scientists with an incentive to innovate.
  It seems likely, then, that the researcher would be able to conduct the research without being held liable for patent infringement, though the corporation holding the patent may try to extract a benefit or compensation for the cell lines.

  The author argues that the fears of researchers that they would be denied access to biological materials for research, particularly if it's noncommercial research, are unfounded. 
  The author also suggests that judges have traditionally recognized a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. 
  Based on these, it is likely that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that academic researchers are increasingly supportive of the idea of intellectual property protection for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential.
  However, there are concerns that restrictions on access to research materials may hinder basic research.
  Even if a corporation holds the patent for the cell lines, the researcher may have a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if the research is noncommercial.
  Judges deciding patent cases have respected a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. 
  For-profit biotechnology corporations are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research. 
  It is not stated that the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for the use of cell lines. 
  Also, the passage suggests that patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  Therefore, the author is most likely to predict that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. However, the author argues that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. 
  Therefore, the author predicts that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that some researchers fear that patent holders will refuse to make their patented materials available without a costly license agreement.
  The author argues that denying access to a researcher conducting basic and noncommercial research is questionable.
  There is a tradition among judges to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  A patent holder would initiate a patent litigation to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to predict that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that obtaining a patent does not necessarily imply the right to deny access.
  There is a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  The passage suggests that patents are likely to spur rather than hinder basic research.
  Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage states that some researchers fear patent holders will charge high fees for using patented materials.
  The author argues that patent holders are unlikely to prevent noncommercial research.
  The author suggests that a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement is respected by judges.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that the for-profit corporation will sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts basic research using the cell lines.
  The answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that it is unlikely for a patent holder to sue a researcher conducting basic and noncommercial research.
  There may be an exception to patent infringement for noncommercial research.
  Patents may spur innovation and have economic benefits.
  Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that researchers conducting basic and noncommercial research are usually exempted from patent infringement.
  Patent litigation is usually initiated to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  Patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage discusses the subtractive method of obtaining FMRI scans. The author argues that while the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. Therefore, the method creates an illusion of neat functional localization that strongly supports the modular theory of mind. The author does not suggest that the results of empirical studies using this method are invalid for medical applications. Nor does the author suggest that the method supports Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity. The author also does not suggest that the method proves that emotions are not seated in the amygdala. Therefore, the best answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues for the reliability of fingerprint identification as evidence in criminal trials.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards in evaluating whether two prints match.
  The authors agree that there is a lack of consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification.
  However, they disagree on the likelihood of fingerprint examiners incorrectly declaring a match.
  Passage A claims an exceedingly low error rate, while Passage B cites a more rigorous test with a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A emphasizes the reliability of fingerprint identification.
  Passage B critiques fingerprint identification, pointing out its lack of objective standards and the unknown error rates.

  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B have different views on the reliability and accuracy of fingerprint identification.
  The authors of Passage A believe that fingerprint identification is reliable and has a low error rate. They think that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review.
  The author of Passage B suggests that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match. They criticize the point-counting method and highlight the absence of a generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. The author also notes that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.
  D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he condueted.
  E: Though he composed and condueted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: According to the passage, which one of the following was true of the physics community during the 1930s?
Choices:
  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: It reevaluated caleulations indicating that atoms could be split
  C: It never identified the by-products ofneutron bombardment ofuraniwn.

Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes the work of the physics community in the 1930s.
  The physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  They conducted neutron-bombardment experiments, but they were not aimed at achieving a result of splitting atoms, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  Therefore, they compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  It was Lise Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data and coined the term "nuclear fission," leading to the corroboration of the findings.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.

  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, which initially puzzled scientists who were conducting neutron-bombardment experiments on uranium.
  It wasn't until Lise Meitner recognized the significance of the data and coined the term "nuclear fission" that scientists began to corroborate the findings.
  The passage doesn't mention that the physics community during the 1930s reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split or recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances.
  The passage does mention that earlier theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, or E.
  The passage does mention that scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing, and that the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.

  The passage describes how scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing Between 1934 and 1939.
  Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Therefore, the earlier theoretical developments were not neglected, but the experimental evidence was lacking.
  The passage also mentions that the products of neutron bombardment of uranium had remained unidentified partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Therefore, the physics community did not reevaluate calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
  The passage also mentions that barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments, was identified as one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Therefore, the physics community never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium is also incorrect.
  The passage does not provide any evidence that uranium atoms were the easiest to split.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Which one of the following is most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" (line 62)?
Choices:
  A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939
  B: the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938
  C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium
  D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus
  E: the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author describes that the evidence for nuclear fission was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The author mentions that the substance resulting from neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium and its structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments.
  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" refers to the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The relevant evidence has been present for some time.
  The author mentions lack of the right conceptual link.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was the result of a series of experimentation.
  The discovery of barium in one of the experiments was meaningless at first but then Meitner recognized its significance.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence means the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The "relevant evidence" (line 62) refers to the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was made after the neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection which led to the discovery.
  The discovery was corroborated by scientists in Europe and North America.
  Choice A is too broad and not specific enough.
  Choice B is too narrow; Meitner's results alone did not lead to the discovery.
  Choice C refers to only one piece of evidence.
  Choice D is relevant but incomplete.
  Choice E is not relevant since it does not refer to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Thus, the answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The author refers to the "relevant evidence" in the context of corroborating the findings of nuclear fission.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was based on evidence compiled by various scientists over several years.
  The crucial theoretical connection was provided by Lise Meitner in 1939.
  Meitner's theoretical connection was based on the results of a neutron bombardment experiment conducted in 1938 by Otto Hahn.
  Hahn's experiment produced a clear chemical evidence of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The evidence that Meitner recognized as indicating nuclear fission was based on the fact that uranium atoms were being split.
  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" (line 62) refers to the neutron bombardment experiments conducted by various scientists between 1934 and 1939, including Hahn's experiment that produced the clear chemical evidence of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author refers to "the relevant evidence" in line 62.
  The sentence following "the relevant evidence" explains that it had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
  Earlier in the passage, the author discusses research by Italian physicists and Meitner related to neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Late in 1938, Hahn wrote to Meitner about a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium.
  Meitner recognized that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms, which she called "nuclear fission."
  From this, it is clear that the relevant evidence referred to in line 62 is the evidence that scientists had actually been splitting uranium atoms, which was unrecognized until Meitner made the connection.
  The answer is (A) the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The "relevant evidence" (line 62) is what allowed scientists to realize that they had been splitting uranium atoms.
  The author explains that this evidence had been present for some time, but lacked the right conceptual link.
  According to the passage, the evidence includes the fact that barium was produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, and that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus.
  Therefore, the most nearly equivalent statement to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
The author elaborated the discovery of nuclear fission and how the relevant evidence was present for some time but was not linked conceptually. 
The term "relevant evidence" is used to refer to the evidence that had been present for some time.
The evidence should be related to the discovery of nuclear fission.
The evidence had been present but was not linked conceptually.
Looking at the options: 
Option A is the neutron bombardment experiments between 1934 and 1939 which led to scientists compiling increasing evidence of nuclear fission. This evidence was not linked conceptually, but it is not the relevant evidence referred to by the author.
Option B refers to related research of Meitner, which was carried out in 1938 and led to her escape from Nazi Germany. Although it is related to the neutron bombardment of uranium, it is not the relevant evidence referred to by the author.
Option C refers to the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by the neutron bombardment of uranium. This evidence was significant because it went against all previous experiences of nuclear physics. However, it is not the relevant evidence referred to by the author.
Option D refers to the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in an uranium nucleus. This fact was noted by Hahn when he wrote to Meitner about the surprising result. However, it is not the relevant evidence referred to by the author.
Option E is the fact that the radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long. Although this fact is related to the discovery of nuclear fission, it is not the relevant evidence referred to by the author. The author emphasized that the evidence had been present for some time, but was not linked conceptually. 
Therefore, the correct answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Response 7:
Thought:
  The "relevant evidence" (line 62) is what the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  The author mentions that the evidence had been present for some time.
  Hahn discovered that one of the substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, which wasn't expected.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data and coined the term "nuclear fission."

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author of passage A argues that insider-trading law should not prohibit trading based on information that one analyzes or knows first.
  The author of passage B argues that insider-trading law should prohibit trading that is not based on transparently available information.
  The question asks which law would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
  Therefore, the best answer is a law that permits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, such as information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The only answer that matches this description is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A argues that it is important for the stock market to have accurate information about a company spread as widely as possible and as quickly as possible.  
  The author thinks that someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping.
  From passage A, it seems that the author is in favor of allowing informed trading in the stock market.
  The author of passage B argues that insider trading is unfair because some people have access to information that other people don't have and can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else. 
  From passage B, it seems that the author is in favor of a transparent stock market where everyone has the same chance of making a good investment.
  Therefore, a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
  The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The author of Passage A seems to be in favor of trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, as it helps ensure that stock prices represent a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts and is good for everyone in the stock market.
  However, the author of Passage A supports insider nontrading, where stocks sales or purchases would have been made but aren't because of inside knowledge.
  The author of Passage B argues that insider-trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence, which could ultimately destroy the market.
  Therefore, the law that best conforms to the position of the author of Passage A but not the author of Passage B would be one that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.

  It also argues that people should be allowed to act on accurate information about changing circumstances.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading unfairly compromises the market, undermines investor confidence, and could ultimately destroy the market.
  It also argues that success in the market should be based on individual merit and skill.
  Therefore, the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would be one that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  This is because such a law would allow people to act on accurate information about changing circumstances without unfairly compromising the market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely and quickly as possible.
  The author believes that insider-trading law should permit trading based on information if it is acquired through analysis.
  But, insider-trading law should prohibit trading based on information gained from one's position within a company.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading compromises the transparency of the stock market.
  The author believes that insider-trading law should prohibit trading based on information that is not available to everyone.
  The law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A supports the idea that stock markets work best when relevant information is spread as widely as possible and that stock prices reflect the most accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  It also argues that "insider-trading" laws should not punish people who use their analysis and research to trade stocks, but only those who trade based on information obtained from their position within a company.
  Passage B supports the idea that transparency is one of the basic principles of the stock market and that insider-trading undermines the market's fairness and investor confidence.
  However, it does not address the idea that stock prices should reflect the most accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  None of the laws presented in the choices conform fully to the position articulated by the author of Passage A, but Choice B comes closest to it.
  Choice B prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, but allows trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A supports the idea that people should be able to trade based on information that everyone else doesn't have.
  The author of Passage A argues that such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts, and this is good for everyone in the stock market.
  Passage B argues that in a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions.
  Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.

  Passage A supports the idea that stock prices should reflect an accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading laws should be in place to prevent some people from having access to information earlier than others.
  Passage B suggests that if some people can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, it can undermine investor confidence and ultimately destroy the market.
  The question asks for a law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
  It follows that the correct answer would be a law that permits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
  Answer (A) is the only option that permits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, without prohibiting trading based on information obtained from analysis of a stock or selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading can be beneficial for the stock market if it helps spread the knowledge that affects stock prices, but insider nontrading is also a widespread practice. 
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that insider trading creates an unfair market and undermines investor confidence.
  Therefore, the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not by the author of passage B would allow trading based on information gained from analysis but prohibit trading based on inside information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A argues that insider trading based on information that everyone doesn't have is not always a bad thing.
  The author of passage B argues that insider trading is unfair and undermines the stock market's transparency, and ultimately investor confidence.
  The author of passage A does not support insider trading but suggests that insider nontrading is far more widespread.
  The author of Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  The closest law to the author of Passage A's position would be one that prohibits insider trading but permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.

  The passage then goes on to explain how the new evidence shows that the structure of the receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  The passage concludes by discussing the medical significance of these findings.
  The main point of the passage is that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that the differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage describes two theories about how neurons communicate with each other: electrical and chemical.
  The electrical theory posits that electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by leaping across synapses.
  The chemical theory posits that neurotransmitters, which are chemicals secreted by excited neurons, bind with corresponding receptor molecules in the receiving neuron and render the neuron permeable to ions, thereby generating an electrical impulse that runs through the cell and transmitting it to the receiving neuron.
  The main point of the passage is that the chemical theory, which posits that the workings of the brain are guided by chemicals rather than electrical signals, has won acceptance in the scientific community due to new evidence that explains how neurotransmitters render the receiving neuron permeable to ions through the structure of receptors that contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  The passage also discusses how the discovery of the different varieties of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels that conform to this structure raises the possibility of highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand concepts.
Increasing returns tend to create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which is opposed to the concept of the Invisible Hand.
Free markets can only work properly if returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
Economists could not represent the increasing returns of the Pin Factory mathematically until the late 1970s.
The main point of the passage is that economists have historically struggled to reconcile the contradiction between increasing returns to scale and the concept of the Invisible Hand. They favored diminishing returns because they could be mathematically represented and were more elegant, but recent developments and the ability to model increasing returns have resulted in this concept being incorporated in mainstream economic thought.

Response 4:
Thought:
The passage discusses two concepts in economic theory - the pin factory and the invisible hand. The Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand are contradictory to each other. The Pin Factory is about the increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand talks about diminishing returns. Diminishing returns allow for a competitive market, while increasing returns lead to monopolies. The Pin Factory concept has been around for a long time but could not be included in economic thought because it was difficult to describe using mathematical models. However, recently, economists have found ways to describe it accurately.
A: This statement is opposite to what is discussed in the passage. The mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally diminishing rather than increasing.
B: This statement captures the main point discussed in the passage. The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
C: This statement is incorrect. The passage doesn't discuss any recent development in mathematics. Rather, it talks about the difficulty of modeling the Pin Factory.
D: This statement is too specific. The passage discusses Adam Smith's contribution to economic theory but this is not the main point of the passage.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915
  D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain
  E: suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The relationships between plants and their primary/secondary substances are being compared to something else.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning while secondary substances are diverse and give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances can arise from genetic mutations that survive through natural selection, some favored for attracting pollinating insects, and some as defensive substances against plant-eating insects.
  Therefore, the answer choice that describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary/secondary substances will have a set of components where one category is required for a basic function, and the other category is diverse and adds unique features.
  Answer choice B describes such a relationship in automobiles where mechanical components are necessary for the basic functioning, while features such as paint and taillights add unique appearance and safety features.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances is such that primary substances are required for plant growth and proper functioning, while secondary substances are not required but give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Option B best describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage describes two categories of chemical substances in plants: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances, such as proteins and carbohydrates, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances are responsible for giving plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  A set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances must involve a necessary component and a component that is not necessary but contributes to the distinctive characteristics of the object.
  Choice A is not an appropriate analogy because generators are necessary to provide electricity in case the usual source of power is temporarily unavailable, whereas primary and secondary substances are both found in plants.
  Choice C is not an appropriate analogy because electrical components such as wires and transformers are necessary to supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, whereas both primary and secondary substances are found in plants.
  Choice D is not an appropriate analogy because braking systems are necessary for trains to decelerate and stop, whereas primary and secondary substances are both found in plants.
  Choice E is not an appropriate analogy because specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to function as word processors, whereas primary and secondary substances are both found in plants.
  Choice B describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances because mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are required for automobiles to run, whereas features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances can be likened to the relationships between essential and nonessential components of an object or process.
Primary substances are essential to plants' growth and proper functioning, whereas secondary substances are not.
Likewise, certain components of an object or process may be necessary for it to function, while other components may simply add to its appearance or provide additional functionality.
Choice (B) describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
The mechanical components of a car, such as engines and transmissions, are necessary for the car to run, just like primary substances are necessary for the proper functioning of plants.
On the other hand, features such as paint and taillights are not necessary for the car to run, but they do contribute to its appearance and provide additional safety features, much like how secondary substances contribute to the taste and smell of plants.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is described.
  Primary substances are necessary for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are diverse chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The relationships can be analogous to another set of relationships.
  B is the most similar to the relationships among plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Automobiles need mechanical components to run, but their distinctive features serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety.
  Plants need primary substances to grow and function, but secondary substances give them their distinctive smells and tastes.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances are being compared to another set of relationships.
  Primary substances are necessary for growth and proper functioning of plants, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances are not necessary for growth and proper functioning, but they do have other functions such as attracting pollinating insects or defending against plant enemies.
  Based on these characteristics, the relationship that is most closely analogous is likely one where there are components that are necessary for a system to function, and other components that are not necessary but have other functions.
  Answer choice B describes a set of relationships where some components are necessary for an automobile to run, while other features are not necessary but serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety.
  This set of relationships is most similar to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
The passage describes two categories of chemical substances found in plants: primary and secondary.
Primary substances are found in all plants and are required for growth and proper functioning.
Secondary substances are found only in some plants and give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
The relationship between primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to a set of relationships in which one set of substances is essential for a process, while a second set is not necessary for the process but contributes to the distinctive characteristics of the process.
Choice A describes an essential process (hospital operation) and a backup system (generators) that is not necessary for the process but provides a contingency plan. This is not analogous to the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants.
Choice B describes an essential component (mechanical components for running a car) and additional features (paint and taillights) that contribute to the car's look and safety. While this is similar to the relationship between primary and secondary substances, the additional features described in choice B are necessary for the car to be roadworthy, whereas secondary substances are not necessary for a plant's growth and functioning.
Choice C describes two sets of components (mechanical and electrical) involved in a manufacturing process. While these components are necessary for the process, they are not analogous to the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants.
Choice D describes two sets of components (friction and pneumatic) used in a braking system. While these components are essential for the function of the braking system, they are not analogous to the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants.
Choice E describes a necessary component (word processing programs for computers) and two ways in which the component can be stored. This relationship is not analogous to the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants.
The best answer is B as it describes an essential component (mechanical components for running a car) and additional features (paint and taillights) that contribute to the car's look and safety. While this is similar to the relationship between primary and secondary substances, the additional features described in choice B are necessary for the car to be roadworthy, whereas secondary substances are not necessary for a plant's growth and functioning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Primary and secondary substances are two categories of chemical substances found in plants.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances is analogous to the relationship between two other sets of relationships.
  Option B describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage describes two different types of chemical substances found in plants: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism but give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Both primary and secondary substances are found in plants, but only secondary substances give plants their distinctive properties.
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants is most closely analogous to the relationship between mechanical components and features such as paint and taillights in automobiles.
  The mechanical components are required for the car to run, but features such as paint and taillights do not directly affect the car's ability to operate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the chemical composition of plants and how plants have developed secondary substances for survival via natural selection.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are present in all plants, while secondary substances are diverse and give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The secondary substances in plants arose due to genetic mutations, and those mutations that survived and were passed on to subsequent generations increased the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing.
  In analogy, an essential component for the proper functioning of a system is like primary substances, while something that gives the system a distinctive look or taste is like secondary substances.
  From the choices, B is the most closely analogous as mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for an automobile to run, while features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage discusses two ways art was produced by and for the elites in the past.
The sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to analyze art produced the second way.
For this kind of analysis to work, the elite had to have a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
Taruskin and others fail to clarify the differences between the first way and the second way of producing art.
Therefore, Taruskin's position does not commit him to any of the choices in the question.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Taruskin's view of high art produced by and for political and social elites.
  Taruskin prefers to deal with art produced by expressing and mirroring the ideals and way of life of the elite.
  The sociohistorical critic must claim that art that went against the grain of elite values embodied the ideals of the elite in hidden ways.
  Therefore, the passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two ways in which art was "produced by and for political and social elites".
  The second way, which Taruskin and others prefer to analyze, involves art that expresses and mirrors the elite's ideals and way of life.
  The analysis of such art depends on the assumption that the elite had a recognizable identity and consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
  Some artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment, and some art went against the grain of elite values.
  The sociohistorical critic must engage in an analysis of how such art embodied the ideals of the elite in hidden ways.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses how people compare themselves to others and how this affects their happiness.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study mentioned in Passage A shows that people feel happier earning less money if they earn more than their neighbors.
  The last paragraph of Passage B suggests that wanting to create value is not ignoble, and that wanting to have more than others is evidence of a desire to create value.
  None of the terms appear to match directly but the author of Passage B suggests that wanting to have more than others is evidence of a desire to create value, so it is unlikely they would use terms such as "misguided" or "primitive". 
  Answer ("admireable") seems like a more likely fit for the author's perspective. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the phenomenon that people like to compare their income with some norm.
  They also mention that people are happy if they feel successful.
  According to Passage A, people overinvest in acquiring material possessions, at the expense of leisure.
  Passage B states that people use material wealth to show that they have created value and they are prosperous because they create value.
  Therefore, it is more likely that the authors of Passage A and Passage B would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "misguided" and "admirable," respectively.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  In passage A, the authors describe the phenomenon of people comparing themselves with their reference group and feeling happy when they are relatively better off than others.
  In passage B, the authors further explain that the desire to create value is the underlying reason why people are happy when they earn more money.
  The authors do not use any of the terms in the choices.
  However, we can infer that, based on the authors' explanation, the person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is seen as admirable because this desire to create value benefits society.
  Therefore, the answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A and passage B discuss how people compare their income with the income of others.
  Passage A describes the concepts of habituation and rivalry and how they impact happiness.
  Rivalry refers to the phenomenon of people comparing themselves to others.
  Passage A suggests that people are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improves.
  Passage B describes how earning more money makes people feel successful and that they have created value; this creates happiness.
  Passage B portrays wanting to create more value as admirable. 
  The question asks which pair of terms describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors, and these terms are likely to be used by the authors of Passage A and Passage B respectively.
  The answer should reflect the authors' views.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A describes people's tendency to compare their income with some norm that must be rising along with actual income.
  The phenomenon of rivalry is discussed, which shows people are happy to be poorer as long as their relative position improved.
  Passage B argues that wanting to earn more money than one's neighbors is not necessarily about wanting to have more than others, but evidence of a desire to create value.
  Based on both passages, it is unlikely that authors would use negative terms like 'misguided' or 'primitive'.
  The terms 'insular' and 'cosmopolitan' are unlikely to be used in relation to the topic of making more money than one's neighbors.
  The terms 'altruistic' and 'egocentric' are both possible, but 'egocentric' is more likely as it describes a person whose motives are self-centered.
  The authors do not describe people who want to make more money than their neighbors as happy or miserable.
  Therefore, the answer is B: egocentric, which is more likely to be used by the authors of passage A and passage B to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The authors of passage A and passage B describe how people compare their income or wealth with their reference group, those who are most like them.
  According to passage A, people are comparing their income with a norm and that norm must be rising along with actual income.
  According to passage B, we use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous but that we are prosperous because we create value.
  The authors of both passages describe how people's desire for more wealth can be explained in terms of their desire to create value or to feel successful.
  None of the pairs of terms really fit with the authors' descriptions.
  However, considering the passages as a whole, it seems that the authors of passage A and passage B would most likely view a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "admirable."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss the phenomenon of people comparing their income with that of their neighbors.
  Passage A indicates that people are motivated by habituation and rivalry to push up the norm of required income.
  Passage B argues that people feel they are successful when they earn more money and are motivated to create value.
  Neither passage describes a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as being insular, cosmopolitan, altruistic, egocentric, happy, miserable, lucky, or primitive.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage B argues that wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness. 
  The authors of Passage A explain that relative prosperity makes people feel successful.
  From the passages, it is not clear that the authors would use either "altruistic" or "egocentric" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Answer choices D and E are unlikely to be used by the authors to describe this behavior.
  The authors are not discussing insularity or cosmopolitanism. 
  The closest answer choice to the authors' concern and argument is the phrase "happy, miserable" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A and passage B both discuss the phenomenon of people comparing their income with others.
  Passage A describes this phenomenon as "rivalry" and notes that people like to improve their relative position.
  Passage B discusses the desire to create value and argues that the urge to have more than others is really a desire to create value.
  Neither passage uses terms like "insular," "cosmopolitan," "altruistic," "egocentric," "lucky," or "primitive" to describe people who want to make more money than their neighbors.
  Neither passage describes people who want to make more money than their neighbors as "happy" or "miserable."
  Passage A does suggest that the phenomenon of rivalry is "misguided," but passage B suggests that the urge to create value is "admirable."
  Therefore, the answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss people's desire to make more money than their neighbors.
  Passage A refers to this desire as a phenomenon of "rivalry," linking it to habituation and social comparisons.
  Passage B argues that people want to create value and feel successful, rather than just wanting more money than their neighbors.
  None of the answer choices accurately reflect these perspectives.
  However, the authors of Passage B do suggest that the desire to create value is admirable, so "admirable" might be the most likely answer choice.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: Based on what can be inferred from their titles, the relationship between the documents in which one of the following pairs Js most ,analogpus to the relationship between passage A and passage B?

  Choice C discusses the inherent dangers of permitting cameras in court, and how televising courtroom proceedings can assist the law. This is not relevant to the topic in passages A and B.
  Choice D discusses the troublesome history of cameras in the courtroom and the laudable motives behind televising courtroom proceedings. This is not relevant to the topic in passages A and B.
  Choice E discusses why cameras should be banned from the courtroom and the inevitability of televised courtroom proceedings. This is also not relevant to the topic in passages A and B.
  Therefore, none of these choices have a relationship similar to that between passages A and B.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B have different arguments on the topic of jury nullification.
  Passage A argues that jury nullification has problems because we do not know how the power of nullification is used, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, and jurors are not legislators.
  Passage B argues that Jury nullification can be helpful as a safety valve to ensure that trivial cases do not result in a conviction, and when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature.
  We need to find a pair of documents that has a similar relationship in terms of different opinions or arguments on a given topic.
  Option A discusses the pros and cons of telecasting courtroom proceedings, whereas Option B talks about the benefits of permitting cameras in court. Hence they do not have the same relationship as Passage A and Passage B. 
  Option C looks relevant as it discusses the dangers of permitting cameras in court in contrast to how such proceedings can assist the law. However, it is not about the same topic as the passages. 
  Option D talks about the negative history of cameras in court in contrast to the positive motives behind telecasting courtroom proceedings. Again, it is not about the same topic as the passages.
  Option E discusses why cameras should be banned in court in contrast to the inevitability of televised courtroom proceedings. It is not about the same topic as the passages.
  Hence, the answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses jury nullification and its problems.
  Passage B discusses the benefits of jury nullification.
  Both passages are related to jury nullification, but they have different perspectives on the issue.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as the phenomenon whereby larger firms achieve lower costs and greater efficiency than smaller firms through increased specialization of tasks.
  The example of the pin factory provided in the passage illustrates increasing returns to scale because it shows how specialization of tasks leads to greater output per worker, enabling a larger factory to produce more pins at lower cost than a smaller one.
  Of the available choices, B and D both involve the idea of greater efficiency enabling greater output with the same or fewer resources, but only D involves the idea of specialization leading to greater efficiency. Therefore, D is the best answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  In the second paragraph, the author describes how the Pin Factory demonstrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  The Pin Factory, with specialized workers, can produce far more than a group of individual workers could.
  This is an example of how increasing returns to scale occur when there are advantages to large-scale operations.
  Therefore, the correct answer is the choice that also illustrates the advantages to large-scale operations.
  Answer Choice A describes a small-scale operation, so it is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Answer Choice B describes specialization, but not returns to scale.
  Answer Choice C describes increased efficiency by rearranging the schedule, but does not involve returns to scale.
  Answer Choice D describes technological advances that help with production, but does not involve returns to scale.
  Answer Choice E describes a process by which multiple colonies grow to contain more ants than one colony ever could, indicating returns to scale.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage states that increasing returns to scale mean bigger firms can produce more efficiently due to specialization and low costs.
  The passage cites railroads as an example of such increased efficiency.
  Lobster industry being able to catch more lobsters through technological advances is also an example of increased efficiency.
  "A" and "C" could be eliminated because they do not relate to the idea of increased efficiency with larger size.
  "E" could be eliminated because it talks about multiple smaller colonies.
  "B" may hint at increased efficiency, but it involves a different example altogether.
  Therefore, "D" stands out as the best answer because it describes how the lobster industry, as a whole, can produce more efficiently with the same number of traps.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that larger scale in production leads to proportional increase in output per worker.
  B explains that a bee colony that is able to collect more nectar, can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar. 
  This is a good example of increasing returns to scale, as larger scale in collection leads to proportional increase in output per worker (collecting nectar).
  Therefore, the answer is B
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Increasing returns to scale means that if the size of the firm or operation increases, the output will increase at an accelerated rate.
  A larger pin factory can take advantage of specialization of tasks and produce more pins per worker.
  The answer must be an example of a firm or operation that produces more output with an increasing scale or size.
  Choice A: relaxing standards means less output, not more. Incorrect.
  Choice B: this describes division of labor that occurs naturally in many operations, but it does not show an increase in output for a given increase in size. Incorrect.
  Choice C: this example describes how to increase capacity, not necessarily increase output. Incorrect.
  Choice D: this describes an increase in output, but not due to an increase in size. Incorrect.
  Choice E: this describes an increase in output as a result of the division of a larger colony into smaller colonies. This is in line with the definition of increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  According to the passage, the concept of increasing returns to scale is illustrated by larger firms achieving larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller firms, which then tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players.
  Therefore, the better illustration of the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage is a situation where a larger entity is able to improve productivity and achieve economies of scale and scope that result in lower costs, and eventually gain a dominant position in the industry.
  Among the given choices, the best illustration is B, where a large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that increasing returns to scale occur when a company's employees specialize in narrow tasks and produce far more than they could if each worked independently.
  The example of the pin factory shows that the greater the specialization of its workers, the more pins the factory can produce per worker, and the more efficient the factory becomes as it grows larger.
  The other choices do not illustrate increasing returns to scale as described in the passage.
  Option A talks about relaxing standards instead of specialization.
  Option B talks about a large colony of bees that use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources which is irrelevant.
  Option C talks about accommodating more students by switching to year-round operation but it does not involve employee specialization and increased efficiency.
  Option D talks about the lobster industry catching more lobsters with advances in technology but it does not involve employee specialization and increased efficiency either.
  Option E talks about the creation of new ant colonies by an existing colony which does not fit the description of increasing returns to scale as described in the passage.
  Therefore, the best choice that illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale is B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as a situation where larger firms have a cost advantage over smaller ones. Larger firms are able to produce more output per worker and per unit of capital. This situation can lead to monopoly power.
  The examples in the choices show situations where efficiency is increased. None of them address the cost advantage of larger firms over smaller ones.
  The answer is not A, B, C, or E.
  Choice D talks about advancing technology enabling an industry to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps.
  With the same capital input (i.e., the number of traps), the industry is able to produce more output (i.e., catch more lobsters). This is a case of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph is that there are larger returns to the scale of production, that is, the more a company produces, the more efficient it becomes.
  In the example of a pin factory, the employees become more specialized in narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently.
  Therefore, an answer that involves a larger scale of production, which leads to greater efficiency without reducing output, will illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Answer B describes how a larger bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, which enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar. This illustrates increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The article defines increasing returns to scale as larger scale meaning more specialization can be achieved and more units can be produced per worker.
  The answer choice that best illustrates this concept is the one in which larger scale means the ability to produce more items per worker.
  Answer choice A describes a reduction in workforce, not the ability to produce more items per worker.
  Answer choice B describes a division of labor between guarding nectar and processing nectar, but not necessarily an increase in nectar production.
  Answer choice C describes an increase in the number of students accommodated but does not describe specialization or efficiency increases in production.
  Answer choice D describes a technological advancement that allows more lobsters to be caught per trap, which is an increase in productivity per unit, but not an increase in scale.
  Answer choice E describes the division of a colony into two competing colonies, but does not necessarily indicate that there is an increase in efficiency or specialization that leads to more units produced per worker.
  Therefore, answer choice D, the lobster industry catching more lobsters per trap, best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to
Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work
  B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work
  C: acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works
  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works
  E: explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage explains Dostoyevsky's stance towards the radical critics' demand that literature should be useful to the society and contribute to creating a new society.
  Dostoyevsky believes that literature is an art and its purpose should be to create fully realized artistic works.
  He thinks that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
  Instead, Dostoyevsky thinks that literature should be a fusion of reality and fantasy and it must be written artistically well.
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. If the radical critics recognized the artistic merit of literary works, their approach would be closer to Dostoyevsky's view. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on literature and what he considers as artistic merit.
He disagrees with the radical critics' view that art should be useful, and that it must be politically motivated.
He thinks that art should be judged based on its artistic merit only.
Therefore, Dostoyevsky's attitude towards the radical critic's view would be most softened if they recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question is asking about Dostoyevsky's attitude toward radical critics' views. 
  The passage states that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' demand that art must serve a particular political view.
  The passage also states that Dostoyevsky considered artistry as the ability to write well rather than its use or purpose.

Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions the radical critics' view that art must be useful to contribute to the creation of a new society, and that the formal aspects of a work are of secondary importance so long as its goal is good and clear, so Dostoyevsky's attitude would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
In the passage, Dostoyevsky's position is contrasted with the radical critics, which refer to critics that maintain that literature should be useful and must be based on concrete reality. Dostoyevsky sees that reality is relative and that there is no distinction between fantasy and reality. He believes that art must be evaluated based on its artistic merit, and it is the reader's job to determine any usefulness that it may provide. 
Therefore, the passage would suggest Dostoyevsky's attitude would soften towards the radical critics' view if they recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:

  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage highlights Dostoyevsky's ideas about the purpose and form of literature in comparison with the radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky's approach to reality and fantasy is different from that of the radical critics, and he believes that reality is not restricted to the tangible or evident.
  He believes that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit and that art must not be tied to any particular political view.
  The answer should be an option that best describes what the radical critics could do to soften Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.
  D: The innovative research methods of Katherine Dunham made possible her discovery that the dance traditions of the Caribbean were derived from earlier African dance traditions.
  E: Katherine Dunham's anthropological and choreographic expertise enabled her to make contributions that altered the landscape of modern dance in North America.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The author claims that no African American writer had attempted to draw upon a music genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in Jazz.
The author further discusses how Jazz, the novel, is structured and how its narration is analogous to a jazz ensemble. 
Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 can be inferred to be that Toni Morrison's Jazz is the first novel that draws upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author states that Toni Morrison is the first African American writer to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  The novel Jazz explores the connection to music not only in the plot but also in the way in which the story is told.
  Toni Morrison created a sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  This method of narration is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand.
  The author is making an assertion about the similarities between the structure of Jazz and the structure of jazz music.

  None of the options directly relates to the author's assertion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question asks about the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
  The lines suggest that African American writers have used music as a theme and metaphor in their writing but not as the structuring principle for an entire novel before Toni Morrison.
  The assertion would be challenged if another African American writer had already based the structure of their novel on a musical genre before Toni Morrison.
  Therefore, (B) has the potential to challenge the author's assertion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
The author is discussing how Jazz is a novel that draws upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for the entire story. Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 is most closely related to the idea of Jazz's narrative structure being related to musical composition.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the function of the third paragraph within the passage as a whole?
Choices:
  A: to refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts
  B: to present evidence that undermines a theory
  C: to provide examples that support an argument
  D: to contrast several different modes of expression
  E: to enumerate specific instances in which a phenomenon recurred

Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes how scientists discovered the planet Neptune based on deviations from Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  Analogous scientific episodes would describe discoveries based on deviations from established theories or auxiliary assumptions.
  Choice A describes a scientific episode where observations deviated from an established theory without implying a new discovery.
  Choice B describes a scientific episode where observations led to the discovery of a new phenomenon, but not deviations from a previously established theory or auxiliary assumption.
  Choice C describes a scientific episode where a hypothesis was developed based on observations, and later evidence was found to support the hypothesis.
  Choice D describes a scientific episode where observations deviated from an established theory, which led to the discovery of a new phenomenon.
  Choice E describes the discovery of a new particle based on deviations from a previously established theory.
  The episode in Choice D, where the deviation from an established theory led to the discovery of a new phenomenon (reversed magnetic polarity), is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The discovery of Neptune is described in Passage B.
  The astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but found it was incorrect.
  They changed their assumption about the existence of other planets and discovered Neptune, which brought their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  The discovery of Neptune is most analogous to another scientific episode where a prediction based on a theory was incorrect, but the theory was not discarded.
  Option A is about a theory which predicted one high tide per day but the observation was two high tides per day, which was false.
  Option B is about discovering that the Milky Way is only a part of the universe, but it is not about a failed prediction based on a theory.
  Option C is about postulating the reason for an event based on observations and then later discovering evidence to confirm the postulation.
  Option D is about discovering that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  Option E is about postulating the existence of a third undetected particle that was later confirmed.
  Option C, D, and E do not fit the requirements.
  Option B is true, but not the best fit.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  In the discovery of Neptune, astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus but found it to be incorrect upon observation.
  The failure of the prediction led them to hypothesize the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Uranus.
  Later, scientists discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  The discovery of Neptune thus came about due to a mismatch between prediction and observation, with the subsequent hypothesis of an auxiliary component, followed by its discovery.
  Searching for scientific analogies, predicting the detailed motion of a celestial object and finding a mismatch between prediction and observation are central to many scientific problems, but focusing specifically on the process of hypothesis and subsequent discovery, the most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune in this context is postulating the existence of Vulcan and failing to observe it, leading to Einstein's theory of general relativity.
  The answer is D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The discovery of Neptune involved astronomers making predictions about Uranus's orbit.
  The predictions were based on auxiliary assumptions and Newton's laws.
  The predictions turned out to be incorrect, and astronomers hypothesized the existence of a new planet.
  The planet was later discovered in the predicted location.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of Vulcan, when astronomers hypothesized the existence of a new planet to explain the incorrect predictions of Mercury's orbit and never found it.
  The answer is D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The discovery of Neptune was made by predicting its orbit using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about other planets' orbits and velocities.
  When the predictions did not match observations, astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Uranus.
  This hypothesis was later confirmed when scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it should be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  There was a false prediction based on the use of auxiliary assumptions in the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the one in which there was a false prediction based on auxiliary assumptions.
  The only answer choice that matches this description is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage B describes astronomers discovering a planet by hypothesizing its existence based on deviations from expected orbit.
  The most analogous scientific episode would involve hypothesizing the existence of an unobserved entity based on observed deviations from expected behavior.
  Choices A, C, D, and E involve observed deviations or phenomena, but no hypothesis of unobserved entities.
  Choice B involves observing deviations and hypothesizing the existence of an unobserved entity (the Andromeda galaxy) based on those deviations.
  Therefore, choice B is the most analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in passage B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes how the discovery of Neptune was made based on the failure of Uranus' predicted orbit to match the actual orbit observed by astronomers
  Therefore, the analogous scientific episode should involve astronomers making predictions and then finding that they do not match observation
  The only choice where a prediction is made based on observations, but the prediction does not match up with observations, is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes how a prediction for the orbit of Uranus was incorrect based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, leading scientists to search for an explanation. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity and later discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with observations.
  Analogy means finding a similarity between two different things. 
  Option A describes a false prediction of tides.
  Option B describes the discovery that Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right.
  Option C describes the postulation of asteroid impact causing dinosaur extinction, followed by the discovery of a large impact crater.
  Option D describes Bernard Brunhes' discovery of rocks magnetized in the opposite direction and his postulation of the reversal of Earth's magnetic field in the past.
  Option E describes Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of a third undetected particle in neutron decay, whose existence was later confirmed. 
  Option C is irrelevant as it is not related to planetary discovery or orbit prediction.
  Option A, B, and D have nothing to do with planetary discovery or orbit prediction either.
  Option E has no similarity to the planetary discovery or orbit prediction either.
  The most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune is the hypothesis of the existence of a third undetected particle in neutron decay, whose existence was later confirmed by experiments. Both episodes involve hypothesizing the existence of an unobserved entity based on calculations. Therefore, Option E is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how astronomers attempted to predict Uranus' orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but their predictions were incorrect.
  After taking into consideration additional auxiliary assumptions, the astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they called Neptune, in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations, and later Neptune was discovered.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is one that also involves an auxiliary assumption leading to a hypothesis that ends up explaining an observation.
  Choice A is not analogous because Galileo's theory of tides is not based on an auxiliary assumption and does not involve the discovery of something new to explain the observation.
  Choice B is not analogous because Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda does not involve auxiliary assumptions or hypotheses.
  Choice C is not analogous because Walter Alvarez's postulation of asteroid impact is not based on an auxiliary assumption, and the later evidence is not a discovery based on the auxiliary assumption.
  Choice D is not analogous because Bernard Brunhes discovery of magnetized rocks may involve an auxiliary assumption, but it does not lead to a hypothesis that explains an observation.
  Choice E is not analogous because Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of a third undetected particle involves a theory change and not an auxiliary assumption leading to a hypothesis that explains an observation.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage B discusses the prediction of Uranus' orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions and how the discovery of Neptune supports the idea that planets beyond the observable ones existed.
  The question asks which scientific episode is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Options A, C, D, and E, do not have the qualities of being predicted beforehand based on existing models and then being discovered after the fact.
  Option B discusses how Edwin Hubble discovered Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right by observing variable stars and how this helped settle the debate about the extent of the universe.
  Option B is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune because it does not relate to the idea of predicting something's existence based on models and auxiliary assumptions, and then discovering it after the fact.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?
Choices:
  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.
  B: Researchers' funding is often contingent on whether they can produce a patentable product.

Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The primary function of the third paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: reject a possible response to the argument made in the first paragraph
  B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.

  The two sentences are related because they both describe the role of defense lawyers when they know their client is guilty.
  The author is not opposing an earlier opinion, using a hypothetical situation, or agreeing in general with the earlier position but disagreeing over the particulars.
  The two assertions are not essentially equivalent, as they describe different actions lawyers should take.
  Therefore, the answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Lines 7-11 discuss whether defense lawyers have to believe their clients are innocent while lines 28-31 discuss what duties defense lawyers have when they know their clients are guilty.
  The author states that lawyers should not present assertions they know to be false.
  The author also states that lawyers should not demonstrate the innocence of guilty clients.
  The author believes that lawyers should appraise the case in their client's favor, present extenuating circumstances, and argue for leniency in sentencing they believe is warranted.
  These statements build on the earlier statements in lines 7-11.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 3:
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 7-11 states that some legal scholars argue that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.
  The two sentences at lines 28-31 state that lawyers should not take every case they are offered and should instead be advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
  The two sentences at lines 28-31 build on the earlier statement by elaborating on the notion that a lawyer's obligation is twofold, and that the lawyer should not be a mere mouthpiece for the defendant.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 to that in the sentence at lines 7-11 is that they are essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 28-31 talks about lawyers' obligation to the court and society, and how guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 presents a contrasting opinion that some legal scholars hold, which is that a lawyer's sole obligation is to provide the best defense they can and that they have no right to judge defendants.
  These two sentences are expressing different perspectives on the same topic of a defense lawyer's obligations.
  The relationship between these two sentences can be described as a disagreement over the particulars.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The sentence at line 28-31 clearly contradicts the position of the legal scholars who claim that defense lawyers have no right to judge defendants.
  The author argues that defense lawyers have a twofold obligation, one to the defendant and the other to the court and society.
  The author notes that lawyers should not deny or affirm their client's guilt when they are certain of it.
  Instead, they should present any extenuating circumstances and argue for leniency in sentencing if warranted.
  Given this, it is reasonable to say that the information in the sentence at lines 28-31 opposes the opinion of the legal scholars reported by the author in the earlier lines.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Lines 7-11 discuss the notion that legal scholars believe defense lawyers must provide the best possible defense.
  Lines 28-31 discuss the ethical obligations of defense lawyers.
  The author argues that defense lawyers have an ethical obligation not to present assertions they know to be false.
  The author also argues that defense lawyers should not attempt to demonstrate the innocence of clients they know to be guilty.
  The author argues that defense lawyers should provide an authentic defense that they believe is in the client's best interest given the facts of the case.
  The information in lines 28-31 is related to the information in lines 7-11 because both describe the role and obligations of defense lawyers in providing the best possible defense for their clients.
  Therefore, the answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Lines 28-31 talk about a lawyer's duty to the court and to society, to be sincere when they know that their clients are guilty, and the defendant should not be falsely represented.
  Lines 7-11 discuss the opinion of some legal scholars that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate.
  The information in lines 28-31 is discussing the duty of a defense lawyer to be sincere and not provide false representation, specifically when the lawyer knows that the client is guilty.
  This duty is of equal importance to the defendant, the court, and society.
  The information in lines 7-11 discusses the opinion of some legal scholars that lawyers should not judge defendants and should only represent them impartially in court.
  There is a relationship between the two sentences, but they are not contradictory.
  Therefore, the answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The two sentences at lines 28-31 are discussing the lawyer's twofold obligation.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 reports an argument from some legal scholars about the lawyer's obligation to provide the best possible legal representation to their clients.
  The author disagrees with these scholars and states that lawyers have an obligation to the court and society as well as the defendant.
  The author argues that lawyers should not present assertions to the court that they know to be false and should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence when they know they are guilty.
  Therefore, the two sentences at lines 28-31 support the author's argument and show the limitations of the lawyer's obligation to provide the best possible legal representation to their clients.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 7-11 presents the opinion of some legal scholars that the lawyer's role is to provide the best defense they are capable of and that they have no right to judge defendants.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 present the author's opinion on the lawyer's obligation to the court and to society.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 argue that lawyers should not present to the court assertions that they know to be false and should not demonstrate the innocence of guilty defendants.
  This position applies to the earlier lines because it acknowledges that the lawyer's obligation is not only to the defendant but also to the court and society.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 is that the former extends and qualifies the latter by presenting the author's opinion on the lawyer's broader obligation to the court and society, which applies to the earlier opinion.
  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to get the differential rate of oxygen use.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  A comparison is needed to find which scenario is most analogous to this situation.
  All the answer choices involve a comparison between two scenarios.
  Only option B seems to be a good analogy. The interpretation of an increase in summer shoppers after a yearlong advertising campaign is similar to the interpretation of a differential rate of oxygen use in the brain after a cognitive task.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  The scan is a result of a subtraction used to show metabolic activity associated with a particular cognitive task.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, one must think of an analogy of a process that focuses only on certain aspects of a larger whole.
  Choice A shows how one particular district contributed to the election of a mayor, while the other districts were not the contributing factor.
  This analogy is not similar to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Choice B shows how an advertisement campaign only affects summer shoppers, while the rest of the year is not affected.
  This analogy is not similar to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Choice C shows how a larger portion of the water supply is used by agricultural customers, so droughts would impact this sector more.
  This analogy is not similar to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Choice D shows how most Internet traffic during peak hours originates from homes instead of office buildings.
  This analogy is similar in the sense that the focus is on origin during peak hours, just like how FMRI scans focus on metabolic activity associated with a cognitive task.
  Choice E shows how cheetahs are the fastest land animals only over short distances. Most cheetahs cannot outrun another animal over long distances.
  This analogy is not similar to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes how neuroimaging is a research method.
  The FMRI measures metabolic activity in the brain.
  The data from the baseline measurement is subtracted from the data gathered while the subject performs a cognitive task.
  The resulting differential rate of oxygen use is interpreted as representing the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  The problem with this interpretation is that the entire brain is active during both the control and task conditions, so it obscures the fact that all brain functions are distributed.
  Based on this, the situation that is most analogous to this interpretation is one in which a measure only accounts for a certain portion of a larger reality.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted through subtraction of a control condition from a cognitive task.
  This method gives a false impression of neat functional localization because it subtracts out all the distributed brain functions.
  The brain is active in both conditions, so the method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active.
  Analogous situations would involve a similar subtraction process giving a misleading impression of the situation under investigation.
  Choice A relates to a situation where one district influenced the outcome of a mayoral election, but there may be other factors as well.
  Choice B describes an advertisement that had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, but it does not involve a subtraction process.
  Choice C talks about how much more water is used by agricultural customers than residential customers, but it does not involve a subtraction process.
  Choice D discusses how most internet traffic during peak hours originates in homes, but it does not involve a subtraction process.
  Choice E is about cheetahs and how they are the world's fastest land animal, but only for short distances.
  The subtraction method of interpreting FMRI scans is most analogous to Choice A, where a particular district's voting influenced the election outcome, but other factors also played a role. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting the brain activity during a control condition from the on-task measurement.
  The baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to get a differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The entire brain is active in both conditions and this method obscures the fact that the brain is widely distributed.
  The method of FMRI scans is most analogous to a situation where something is subtracted or removed to observe the effects of a particular entity.
  Among the choices, B seems closest to this analogy where the advertisements are the only changing entity, and their effects are observed by looking only at the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  A baseline scan is taken and then a scan while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The baseline scan is subtracted from the on-task scan to give a differential rate of oxygen use.
  The resulting scan is interpreted as the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  The entire brain is active in both the control and task conditions.
  The subtractive method produces striking images, but gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  Which one of the following is most analogous to this way of interpreting FMRI scans?
  A: The outcome of an election in which one district supported the winning candidate by a large margin, so it was the deciding factor.
  B: A store that advertised for one year and had an increase in customers only during the summer, so the advertisements targeted only summer shoppers.
  C: More of the water supply is used by agriculture than by residential customers, so drought has a greater impact on the agricultural sector.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic originates from homes rather than office buildings.
  E: Cheetahs are the world's fastest land animals, but only for short distances, so they are not usually successful in chasing prey over long distances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted using a subtraction method.
  A baseline measurement is taken of the brain in a control condition.
  A second measurement is taken while the subject performs a cognitive task.
  The baseline measurement is subtracted from the task measurement to isolate the metabolic activity associated with the task.
  The resulting activity shows only the differential rate of oxygen use.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The question asks for an analogy to this interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice A is not a good analogy.
  Choice B is not a good analogy.
  Choice C is not a good analogy.
  Choice D is not a good analogy.
  Choice E is the best analogy because it describes how the cheetah, like the human brain, can perform a task ("world's fastest land animal"), but only for a short distance. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The remaining measurement is supposed to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The question asks for an analogous situation.
  Choices A, B, C, and E do not seem to be analogous to FMRI scans interpretation.
  Choice D seems analogous because it describes a situation where the majority of internet traffic originates in homes during the evening hours, yet it does not mean that all other hours have no internet activity.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the way FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Interpretation is based on a subtraction method.
  A baseline measurement is subtracted from the measurement taken during a cognitive task.
  This method obscures that the whole brain is active in both conditions.
  Answer choice (A) discusses one district being responsible for a win, but this is not analogous to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Answer choice (B) discusses an advertising campaign affecting only summer shoppers, but this is not analogous to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Answer choice (C) discusses a greater impact on the agricultural sector during droughts, but this is not analogous to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Answer choice (D) discusses a higher origin of Internet traffic from homes during evening hours, but this is not analogous to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Answer choice (E) discusses the ability of cheetahs to outrun other animals over long distances, but this is not analogous to how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  The answer is NOTA (None of the Above).
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage explains how brain scans are used to observe mental activity.
  FMRI scans show differential rates of oxygen use in response to a cognitive task.
  The interpretation of this method subtracts a baseline measure from an on-task measure.
  Oftentimes, this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the answer should describe a method that compares two states by subtracting one from the other.
  Choice (A) describes a district that is crucial for a candidate's victory.
  Choice (B) describes an advertising campaign that affects a specific season.
  Choice (C) describes a drought that impacts agricultural customers more than residential customers.
  Choice (D) describes how most Internet traffic during peak evening hours originates from homes.
  Choice (E) describes how cheetahs are fast for only short distances.
  Choice (B) is most analogous to interpreting FMRI scans because it compares two states (advertising campaign vs. no advertising campaign) and subtracts one from the other to determine the effect of the advertising campaign on summer shoppers.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph suggests that the second version of multicultural education, which takes a neutral stance, is not essentially different from the first version of teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture. The objection argues that Western scientific methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are already value-laden, which makes it impossible to understand and appreciate other cultures. The critics argue that real understanding of other cultures can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied. 
Option A is incorrect because it refers to culture's values, not social and historical circumstances.
Option B is merely restating the objection discussed in the second paragraph.
Option C is extreme, and the objection did not state that studying other cultures from more than one cultural perspective is necessary.
Option D is incorrect because the objection argues that understanding other cultures means appreciating them on their own terms, not that they must share the same values.
Option E is outside the scope of the objection. The objection does not discuss the values of liberalism, but rather the methods of studying other cultures from the Western scientific heritage. 
Therefore, the answer is B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
The objection raised in the second paragraph argues that understanding cultures by Western scientific methods is distorting and an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism, and insists on adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied for genuine understanding.
Option A claims that social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values. There is no information in the passage supporting this claim.
Option B is consistent with the objection raised in the second paragraph that acknowledges the role of social and historical circumstances in developing a culture's values.
Option C is not supported by the passage as the objection does not necessarily claim that multiple cultural perspectives must be applied.
Option D is also not supported by the passage because the objection does not claim that cultures must share the same cultural values to be understood.
Option E is not the objection raised in the second paragraph but can be seen as an argument that the scientific method is not adequate for an adequate understanding of liberalism.
Therefore, the answer is B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
The objection discussed in the second paragraph notes that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed. However, critics of this second form of multicultural education argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and to try to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Option A is incorrect because it suggests that the social and historical circumstances of a culture cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values, while the objection raised in the second paragraph notes that a culture's value system cannot be understood except from within the context of its own social and historical circumstances.
Option B is not a bad answer, but it does not align with the objection raised in the second paragraph. 
Option C is not really related to the objection raised in the second paragraph. 
Option D is incorrect as the objection raised in the second paragraph notes that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. 
Option E aligns with the objection raised in the second paragraph that to try to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Therefore, the correct answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:

  Therefore, critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with choice E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph is based on the idea that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective.

Therefore, the critics would most likely agree with the idea that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is done solely from within the majority culture's perspective.
  They believe that the objective, logical, and empirically verifiable methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and involve a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  It is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
The critics of the second version of multicultural education hold that adopting Western social science methods to examine non-Western cultures is not only distorting, but also an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
They argue that the Western scientific heritage's epistemological system is already value-laden, and using Western methods of examining cultures involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
Therefore, the critics would be most likely to agree with the option that questions the use of Western science to understand other cultures.
Option A is too absolute and does not give an alternative to the possible solution. The critics have not stated that it is impossible for members of a culture with different values to understand social and historical circumstances of a culture.
Option B could be correct as the critics argue that different social and historical circumstances shape culture, but it does not relate to the objection they hold.
Option C is not what the critics have argued for; they believe in adopting the methods and perspectives of other cultures to understand them.
Option D puts an absolute condition on understanding another culture that is not what the critics have argued in the objection. 
Option E resonates with the objection by the critics of the second form of multicultural education. They argue that using Western scientific methods to understand the values of liberalism is limited and does not give a complete understanding of them.
Therefore, the answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The objection raised in the second paragraph of the passage emphasizes that the methods of Western science that are used to understand other cultures are already value-laden, and do not necessarily lead to genuine understanding of those cultures.
  The objection suggests that in order to achieve genuine understanding of other cultures, it is important to adopt the (often non-scientific) perspectives and methods of those cultures.
  Option A suggests that a culture's values can only be understood by its own members, which is not the main point raised by the objection.
  Option B is consistent with the objection's emphasis on the importance of social and historical circumstances in the development of a culture's values, but it does not address the importance of adopting those cultures' perspectives and methods to achieve genuine understanding.
  Option C suggests the importance of considering multiple cultural perspectives, which is related to but not the main idea emphasized by the objection.
  Option D is not consistent with the objection's emphasis on the importance of adopting other cultures' perspectives and methods in order to achieve genuine understanding.
  Option E emphasizes the limitations of Western scientific methods in understanding liberal values, which is related to but not the main idea emphasized by the objection.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The objection raised in the second paragraph is that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is strictly conducted through the methods of Western science.
  This objection argues that each culture should be taken on its own terms without imposing the values of one culture as standards by which others are judged.
  Option E aligns with this objection, arguing that liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
  Therefore, E is the correct choice.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Critics argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if examined only through the methods of the majority culture.
  The value system of a culture cannot be understood and appreciated if one insists on approaching it solely from within the majority culture's perspective.
  The second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first, and to try to understand non-scientific cultures by Western scientific methods is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, the critics would most likely agree with the idea that understanding another culture requires adopting that culture's perspective and methods.

Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and the evolution of secondary substances in reaction to plant-eating insects. Insects play a major role in the development of the secondary substances in plants. The competition between plants and insects has led to fewer plants remaining as suitable food sources for insects. The main point of the passage is the relationship between plants and insects and the evolution of plants in response to insects. Choice C accurately expresses the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes the difference between primary and secondary substances in plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive smells and tastes and they are a result of evolutionary interactions with insects.
  These interactions have led to the evolution of defensive substances in plants and the ability of insects to circumvent them.
  The competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of substances present in plants as well as the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants in terms of primary and secondary substances.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, which are believed to have developed through evolutionary interactions with insects.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the two categories of chemical substances in plants: primary and secondary substances.
  The secondary substances can give plants distinctive tastes and smells, and these substances play varying roles in plants' interactions with insects.
  Insects have played a major role in the evolution of plants' secondary substances.
  As plants develop defenses against insects, insects must adapt their feeding habits or develop ways to circumvent plants' defenses.
  The competitive process between plants and insects has led to both a narrowing of the range of secondary substances in plants and a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  The main point of the passage is that the distinctive tastes and smells of present-day plants result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins
  B: endorse a claim simply because it is widely believed
  C: accept a claim for the sake of argument
  D: attempt to resolve an apparent paradox
  E: assert that their positions are supported by data

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial
  D: theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case, before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

  Passage B, discusses the relationship between determinism and free will and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. 
  Neither passage directly displays an attitude toward each other's ideas.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that people's behavior is caused solely by the operations of the brain and argues for deterring future harms rather than punishing bad people.
  Passage B discusses how determinism and free will can coexist and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  There is no indication in Passage B that there is an attitude toward the ideas that is dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical.
  Passage B presents the ideas in a more engaged manner than Passage A, as it outlines a specific theory and its implications.
  Therefore, the answer is A: engaged.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that neuroscience changes the way we think about the law, so the author seems engaged in the topic.
  Passage B presents a theory about the coexistence of free will and determinism, so the author may be skeptical about the topic to avoid taking a stance on one side or another.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C or E.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage B presents the concept of determinism and free will, and how a disease-free brain's actions could be considered free.
  Passage A discusses how neuroscience has changed how we think about the law and suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution and focus on deterring future harms.
  The attitude towards the ideas in passage B is not dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical.
  Engaged seems to be the closest word to describe how passage B presents its ideas.
Action: Answer("A")

Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that people are not completely rational when making decisions, and the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of punishment.
  Passage B argues that determinism and the idea of free will can coexist. It distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions and suggests that actions from a disease-free brain are free, even though they may be determined.
  There is no indication in Passage B that the author opposes or rejects the ideas discussed.
  The author seems to be more engaged in discussing the ideas and providing evidence-based arguments to support their point of view.
  The author of Passage B presents an argument and supports it with evidence rather than dismissing the ideas presented in Passage A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage B discusses how the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.
  Alfred Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" is presented as a way to understand how actions can be free.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the attitude of Matthew Arnold toward the aristocratic and middle classes can best be described as one of
Choices:
  A: respect
  B: empathy
  C: indifference
  D: disappointment
  E: scorn

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education highlights that some critics argue that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western, and thus, not essentially different from the first version.
  The objection is that the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  Thus, the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education would be one that establishes that adopting the scientific Western perspective is not distorting to other cultures.
  Options A, B and C do not address the concern raised in the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option D is irrelevant to the discussion of multicultural education in the passage.
  Option E affirms the need for understanding another culture to adequately appreciate that culture but does not address the criticism of using Western scientific methods for examining other cultures.
  Therefore, none of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it adopts a Western scientific perspective and heritage in understanding other cultures, which is not significantly different from the first version.
  To object to this criticism, it needs to be shown that the second version does not adopt a Western scientific perspective and heritage in understanding other cultures.
  Option A is irrelevant because the objection is not about the ability to adopt the perspectives and methods of another culture, but about the appropriateness of adopting a Western scientific perspective and heritage in understanding other cultures.
  Option B is also irrelevant because having similar value systems does not address the issue of adopting a Western scientific perspective and heritage in understanding other cultures.
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system in studying different cultures, which may be an argument for the second version of multicultural education, but it does not directly address the criticism of the second version as adopting a Western scientific perspective and heritage in understanding other cultures.
  Option D is also irrelevant because it does not address the criticism or the second version of multicultural education.
  Option E is not an objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, but a claim that genuine understanding is necessary for appreciating another culture.
  Therefore, none of the options provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first as scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures.
  The objection states that it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  To provide the strongest objection to the criticism, we need to show that adopting non-Western methods and perspectives is possible and that it results in more genuine understanding of the cultures studied than adopting solely Western scientific methods.
  Choice C provides such an objection.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education's methods is that they are value-laden and Eurocentric.
  The objection is that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied.
  The question asks for the choice that would provide the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option A is not relevant, as the objection is not about adopting a culture wholesale, but about adopting their methods of understanding.
  Option B is not relevant, as it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. 
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies are already using their own value system when studying other cultures, which could address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education that their methods are too Western. However, it does not provide the strongest objection.
  Option D is not relevant to the discussion surrounding multicultural education, as it is discussing the achievements of Western culture rather than the methods of studying other cultures.
  Option E is already an accepted premise in the discussion, as educators advocate for multicultural education as a means to achieve multicultural understanding. 
  Therefore, the strongest objection is given by option C, which suggests that some non-Western societies are already using their own value system when studying other cultures, thereby addressing the criticism of the second version of multicultural education that their methods are too Western. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multiculturalism is that it involves the Western scientific heritage and its methods.
  The Western scientific heritage values objectivity over subjectivity, logic over intuition, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  The objection to this criticism is that the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied must be adopted to achieve real understanding.
  Therefore, the option that would provide the strongest objection is the one that shows that the perspectives and methods of non-Western cultures can be adopted.
  Option A is not relevant because it suggests that adopting non-Western perspectives and methods is impossible.
  Option B is irrelevant as it suggests that non-Western societies are similar.
  Option C suggests that non-Western societies use a different value system, but it does not address whether adopting that value system is possible or desirable.
  Option D is irrelevant to the issue at hand.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is still based on Western scientific methods.
  Critics argue that non-scientific cultures cannot be understood through scientific methods.
  If we can use the perspectives and methods of a foreign culture, the objection to the second version of multicultural education would be weakened.
  Therefore, the answer is A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The second version of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms, but the methods of examination are still Western.
  Critics argue that these methods are value-laden and thus not essentially different from the first version.
  The objection is that trying to understand non-scientific cultures with Western scientific methods is distorting.
  To provide the strongest objection, it must be shown that understanding non-scientific cultures with Western scientific methods is not distorting, or that there is a better alternative.
  "A" is irrelevant because it does not address the objection.
  "B" does not provide a counterargument to the objection.
  "C" suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying other cultures, but this does not address the objection. 
  "D" is not relevant because it talks about understanding Western achievements.
  "E" supports the critics' argument, but it does not provide a counterargument.
  Therefore, none of the choices provide the strongest objection to the criticism.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is based on the idea that adopting a Western scientific approach to examining other cultures is not adequate.
  The objection to this states that true understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism would be an argument that adopting Western scientific methods is adequate or that it is still possible to achieve a good understanding of another culture by adopting Western scientific methods.
  Option A is not a strong objection to this criticism since it actually supports the criticism.
  Option B is not relevant as it refers to similarities among non-Western societies, which is not related to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option C is also not a strong objection because it only refers to some non-Western societies and does not address the broader issue of whether adopting Western scientific methods is adequate for understanding other cultures.
  Option D is also not relevant as it refers to the understanding of one's own culture and does not address the issue of understanding other cultures.
  Option E is not a strong objection as it only emphasizes the importance of understanding other cultures but does not address the issue of whether adopting Western scientific methods is adequate for achieving that understanding.
  Therefore, none of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures is distorting. 
  The objection to this criticism is that adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied can lead to real understanding.
  Therefore, the statement that would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education would be one supporting the idea that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied is a more effective way of understanding them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that its methods of examination are still based on Western scientific perspectives and heritage.
  The objection to this criticism is that adopting a non-scientific method of understanding other cultures would not be possible.
  Thus, the strongest objection to the criticism would be a statement that supports the idea that adopting a non-scientific method of understanding other cultures is not feasible.
  Choice A suggests that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture, which provides an objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that Schoenberg's work remains disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
  Therefore, a disturbing work similar to Schoenberg's would be one that faces some difficult truths.
  Among the choices, only B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, does something similar. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that some of Schoenberg's work remains disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
  Therefore, we need to look for a comedian whose work similarly unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
  A comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor (A) is not analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  A comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians (C) is not analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  A comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy (D) is not analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  A comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience (E) is not analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  A comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore (B) is the most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is disturbing, because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how Schoenberg's music precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  A comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor or whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians may be disturbing, but not in the same way as Schoenberg's music.
  A comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy may be disturbing as it may challenge the audience's views and values.
  A comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore may be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage describes Schoenberg's music being disturbing because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Therefore, we are looking for something that deals with a similar idea of exploring new, uncomfortable topics.
  A comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor is unlikely to be a similar analogy because it is unlikely to be exploring new topics.
  A comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore is a perfect analogy since Schoenberg's music was about exploring new emotional states, which may be difficult to face.
  A comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians does not explore new topics.
  A comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy is not analogous to exploring new emotional states.
  A comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience does not necessarily explore new topics.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how Schoenberg's music is disturbing but important because it expresses emotional states that music had not recorded before. 
  The passage doesn't provide examples of other things that are disturbing in a similar way.
  We need to identify something that is disturbing but important because it expresses something that hasn't been expressed before.
  Choice B talks about a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
  This is similar to what the passage says about Schoenberg's music.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage emphasizes that Schoenberg's music is essential because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  The music is disturbing, not because it is incoherent, shrill and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
  Therefore, to find an answer choice that has a similar effect, we need to look for something that faces difficult truths and expresses them in a disquieting way.
  Answer choice A and C do not have any mention of expressing difficult truths.
  Answer choice D mentions an extreme political philosophy which is not related to expressing difficult truths through art.
  Answer choice E mentions unfamiliar style, but it does not necessarily mean that it faces difficult truths.
  Answer choice B involves expressing something that people would prefer to ignore which is similar to Schoenberg expressing difficult truths. Therefore, the correct answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage talks about how Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Therefore, we are looking for a comedian whose material delves into a troubling or uncomfortable aspect of human nature.
  Choice A is not correct because vulgar humor is not necessarily thought-provoking or unsettling.
  Choice B seems to be the most likely answer because it speaks to the idea of bringing attention to uncomfortable truths.
  Choice C is not relevant to the question.
  Choice D is not relevant to the question.
  Choice E is not correct because unfamiliarity would not necessarily make something disturbing.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage states that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Thus, the most analogous option would be someone who, like Schoenberg, portrays or addresses something disquieting, but also "essential."
  Option B most to corresponds to this description, as the comedian's humor lightens uncomfortable aspects of human nature, which are essential, yet often overlooked.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question is asking about what would be most analogous to the way Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing.
  The passage says that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
  Therefore, the answer choice that is most analogous to this would be a comedian whose humor also precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that comedy had not recorded before.
  Answer choice A is not analogous because vulgar humor is not necessarily disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is.
  Answer choice C is not analogous because using pre-existing material is not necessarily disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is.
  Answer choice D is not analogous because expressing an extreme political philosophy is not necessarily disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is.
  Between answer choices B and E, B is the most similar to how Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  Answer: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage argues that what makes Schoenberg's work essential is that it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Therefore, something that could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54 would be something that precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes-disquieting emotional states that [art/media of that type] had not recorded before.
  Answer choice B is the only option that fits this description.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
Response 0:

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
  D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  E: "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone not from the Border region.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author mentions that CJD is inevitably fatal.
  The author provides evidence that prions reproduce themselves without the need for nucleic acid.
  The author suggests that prions may be linked to other neurological diseases.
  The author provides no evidence or suggestion that infected patients will recover from CJD.
  The author states that prions reproduce themselves, which indicates no natural defense.
  The author explicitly states that the mechanism behind prion reproduction is not completely understood.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the author is least likely to agree with choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage extensively discusses the nature of prions and how they cause CJD, so the answer will be something that contradicts the passage's key points.
  The passage argues that CJD is inevitably fatal, and there is no effective therapy preventing the pathogen's reproduction.
  The passage states that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  The passage states that prions exist as harmless proteins in many of the body's tissues, making the immune system unresponsive when they are present.
  No point in the passage implies that any patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease, so this answer contradicts the passage's key points.
  Thus, the answer is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage explains that CJD is inevitably fatal and the body does not produce an immune response when prions are present.
  There is no mention of any potential for patients to recover from CJD in the passage, making choice B incorrect.
  The author agrees that the presence of abnormally shaped prions is a sign of neurological disease and that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  The passage explains that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
  The author would be least likely to agree with a statement that is contradictory to the information in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that CJD is inevitably fatal, so there is no chance for recovery. Therefore, the author would not agree with B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage defines utility maximization principle as a rational economic choice.
  Rational choice means individual will choose the action that maximizes the anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The satisfaction is accordingly weighed based on the likelihood of the outcomes and the weighted utilities are then added.
  An action that maximizes the satisfaction is a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives considering the expected utility.
  Only a singular action that irrationally responds to the economic incentives and disincentives should be selected.
  Choice A: A waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government to reduce his tax, which is a rational choice considering the probability of getting caught.
  Choice B: A motorist avoids speeding because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to losing her driver's license, which is a rational choice considering the fear of losing her license.
  Choice C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant, which is a rational choice considering the cost-benefit analysis.
  Choice D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family, which is a rational choice considering the lack of economic opportunities.
  Choice E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair, which is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives as it is an impulsive crime of passion.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The utility maximization principle suggests that individuals will commit the act that maximizes their overall satisfaction.
  This is determined by the weighted utilities of the possible outcomes.
  A person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  A rational response to economic incentives and disincentives would be an action that maximizes a person's overall satisfaction using the expected utility obtained from each outcome.
  Therefore, the least appropriate action would be one that does not follow the expected utility maximization principle.
  This would be the one where the individual doesn't take into account the expected utility of each outcome and the associated likelihood of each outcome coming to pass.
  Answer choice E describes an impulsive action that does not follow the principle of expected utility maximization.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that a rational individual chooses the action that maximizes their overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  An individual who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.
  Therefore, the answer is the option that seems to be the least rationally motivated by economic incentives.
  Option E, where a worker physically assaults his former supervisor because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair, seems to be the least rationally motivated by economic incentives. There is no economic incentive that would justify such an impulsive and violent reaction.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The economic principle of utility maximization suggests that individuals weigh the expected outcomes and costs of their actions.
  These weights determine the individual's expected utility of each action.
  Rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described rational response to economic incentives and disincentives would be the one that does not maximize the anticipated overall satisfaction of the individual.
  Choice A involves a waiter concealing his tip income to reduce his taxes, which would maximize his anticipated overall satisfaction.
  Choice B involves a motorist avoiding speeding on a certain stretch of road to avoid losing her driver's license, which would maximize her anticipated overall satisfaction.
  Choice C involves an industrialist continuing to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant, which would maximize his anticipated overall satisfaction.
  Choice D involves a government official risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family, which would maximize her anticipated overall satisfaction.
  Choice E involves a worker physically assaulting his former supervisor, which is not an action that would likely maximize his anticipated overall satisfaction.
  Therefore, Choice E would be the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage explains how rational individuals maximize their expected utility when making a decision.
  The example that does not fit this principle must be an irrational action taken that does not align with maximizing one's expected utility when making a decision.
  Answer A, B, C, and D all describe people who are making a decision based on the expected value that satisfies them, given their current circumstances.
  Only answer E describes an individual who acts impulsively without considering the potential negative consequences of their actions.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle implies that a rational person will choose to commit a crime if the expected utility of doing so exceeds that of lawful activity, given the chance of getting caught.
  The person acting rationally can be incentivized to avoid criminal activity if the penalty for getting caught makes the expected utility of criminal activity less than that of lawful activity.
  The fine or penalty for illegal activity acts as a cost that decreases the expected utility of criminal activity.
  Therefore, the option where the cost of the crime does not outweigh the expected utility of criminal activity would be the least appropriate response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  This would be option C, where an industrialist continues to illegally discharge pollutants into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for doing so.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The principle of utility maximization assesses a person's choice as rational or irrational based on their expected utility.
  Rational choices are made by people who will choose the action that maximizes their overall satisfaction.
  Actions that maximizes anticipated satisfaction are those that will yield the highest expected utility.
  The question asks for the option that is least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  A rational act is one that maximizes expected utility.
  The option that does not follow rational behavior in response to incentives is the least appropriate option.
  Option E describes an impulsive and emotional act that is not based on maximizing expected utility.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle is a way of analyzing an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  Within this economic framework, an individual's choice to commit a crime is determined by weighing the anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility of committing the crime against the expected utility of lawful activity.
  The expected utility of criminal activity is lowered by the increasing cost of detection and punishment (as deterrence methods) that make it less likely that a person will commit a deliberate crime.
  All of the examples given represent a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  However, only one option is the least appropriate or the least rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option E describes an impulsive crime committed due to personal reasons with no connection to economic incentives.
  Thus, the least appropriately described response to economic incentives and disincentives would be the option E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of an action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  The example that would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives would be the one where the person's behavior is not influenced by the economic incentive or disincentive.
  Option A reflects that the waiter is responding rationally to the economic disincentive of paying high taxes by avoiding tax while believing the probability of getting caught is low.
  Option B reflects that the motorist is responding rationally to the economic disincentive of losing her driver's license by avoiding speeding on the heavily patrolled road.
  Option C reflects that the industrialist is responding rationally to the economic disincentive by considering the cost of treatment before deciding to pollute the river.
  Option D reflects that the government official is responding rationally to the economic incentive of soliciting bribes due to the inadequate salary; although it is an unethical response, it is rational to her decision-making process.
  However, Option E reflects that the worker is impulsive instead of responding rationally to economic incentives. His response is due to personal emotions, not an economic consideration.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle suggests that a person will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  A, B and D illustrate people's rational responses to economic incentives and disincentives.
  C illustrates an irrational economic response, that is, the industrialist's cost-benefit analysis of illegal pollution discharges is wrong.
  E is an impulsive crime that is not determined by a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, the least appropriate description would be E.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The passage discusses two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes had art produced for them.
The first way was to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
The second way was to create a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
Sociohistorical critics analyze the second way of producing art to interpret the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
Art produced by the governing and well-to-do middle classes was not always apt to produce art that endures.
Sociohistorical critics must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
The main point of the argument is that there have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them. One way was to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. The second way was to create a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life. Sociohistorical critics analyze the second way of producing art to interpret the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite. Therefore, the answer is E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism
  D: admiration for its subtle critique of contemporary culture
  E: appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency towards monopoly.
  The author notes that the invisible hand depends on many competitors in each industry so that no one player can exert monopoly power.
  To undermine this connection, we need to counter the argument that increased size naturally leads to monopoly power.
  Option A is irrelevant, as it doesn't address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option B is also irrelevant, as it is concerned with the salaries of specialized workers, not the relationship between size and monopoly.
  Option C supports the author's argument rather than undermining it.
  Option D is a possible answer because it suggests that the connection between increased size and monopoly power is not straightforward and varies depending on the industry.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument and is discussing the productivity gains from specialization.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage states that increasing returns lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  The author argues that the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  Therefore, if there is evidence that larger firms do not necessarily drive smaller firms out of business and dominate the industry, it would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice (A), (B), (C), and (E) do not provide evidence against the argument.
  Choice (D), if true, suggests that it may not be possible for all industries to achieve increasing returns to scale, which would undermine the idea that increasing returns necessarily lead to larger and more dominant firms.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author implies that the connection between increased size and monopoly power is based on the assumption that returns to scale are increasing, not diminishing.
  If there is evidence that returns to scale are either diminishing or not necessarily increasing, then the connection would be undermined.
  Answer choice D suggests that the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely by industry.
  This implies that the relationship between size and returns to scale is not necessarily straightforward, and different industries may have different optimal sizes. 
  Answer choice D would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it suggests that the assumptions that the author's argument depends on may not apply uniformly across all industries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The invisible hand works properly when there are many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  If there were a case where increasing returns to scale didn't necessarily lead to monopoly power, then it would undermine the author's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that increasing returns to scale lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The author draws a connection between the Pin Factory concept and increasing returns to scale.
  The question asks which option undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option A is irrelevant because it suggests that larger businesses in different regions have no effect on regional monopolies.
  Option B does not address the issue of monopoly power.
  Option C supports the idea of monopoly power gained through the domination of a few players in an industry.
  Option D could change the extent of increasing returns but doesn't address the connection between size and monopoly power.
  Option E suggests that making workers too specialized can have a negative impact on productivity.
  None of the answer choices seems to address the issue of increased size and monopoly power directly.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale might lead to natural monopoly and undermine the competition that fuels free markets.
  The author suggests that a large number of competitors in each industry is required for the invisible hand to work properly.
  If there is evidence that some industries have few players, but don't have monopoly power, it would weaken the argument that large firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players.
  Such evidence would suggest that other factors can prevent large firms from becoming monopolies.
  Choice A presents such evidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly because large businesses can achieve lower costs than small businesses.
  The author also points out that the invisible hand only works properly when there are many competitors in each industry.
  Therefore, the connection between increased size and monopoly power depends on the assumption of diminishing returns.
  Option A does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power since it suggests that there are some businesses that can exert monopoly power in certain regions.
  Option B does not relate to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option C actually strengthens the connection between increased size and monopoly power as it suggests that few players in an industry can collude to set prices as high as a true monopoly.
  Option D weakens the connection between increased size and monopoly power by stating that the size needed to achieve increasing returns varies widely in different industries.
  Option E does not relate to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author claims that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The author also claims that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry.
  Therefore, the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power could be undermined if there were many competitors despite increased size.
  Choice A points out that there are businesses with monopoly power in one region, which means that there are still many competitors in other regions, undermining the author's connection.
  Choice B is unrelated to whether increased size leads to monopoly power.
  Choice C supports the author's claim that increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power.
  Choice D also doesn't relate to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice E relates to the idea of increasing specialization, but not to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author describes a contradiction between the Pin Factory's increasing returns to scale and the need for many competitors in each industry.
  The author argues that the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  Therefore, if there is evidence that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power, it would undermine the author's connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice A, C and E do not challenge the author's connection.
  Choice B does not directly relate to the issue of monopoly power.
  Choice D suggests that the relationship between size and monopoly power varies widely from industry to industry, which would undermine the author's connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author discusses how increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power and fewer competitors in an industry.
  The author mentions that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry.
  The author suggests that diminishing returns are assumed in economic theory because they lend themselves readily to elegant formalism.
  If it were true that the size required to achieve increasing returns varied widely from industry to industry, this would imply that increasing returns do not necessarily lead to monopoly power as businesses would not be able to achieve larger scale and thereby lower costs as easily.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society
  E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's position on realism in literature.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality was different from the radical critics'.
  He believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it, and that reality was more than just the tangible.
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" because reality was necessarily different for each person.
  The task of the writer, according to Dostoyevsky, was to explode the boundaries between the real world and the fantastic.
  It was not necessary for art to serve a particular political view, and a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit.
  Dostoyevsky believed that artistry was simply the ability to write well, and that the formal aspects of a work were important.
  Dostoyevsky saw the utilitarian claim that a work should be "useful" as unsatisfactory because it was impossible to know what would show itself to be useful.
  Therefore, the answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality goes deeper than the radical critics' view of reality.
  For Dostoyevsky, there is no distinction between fantasy and reality, and reality is far more than the merely tangible.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: The passage stat es that the writing on clay tablets found in Uruk
Choices:
  A: was not deciphered by archaeologists until 1992

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science, particularly his views on the role of negative evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B is an example of how scientists revise their theories based on their observations and developing new ones based on newly discovered phenomena.
  The astronomers in passage B revised their auxiliary assumptions to account for the orbit of Uranus and later hypothesized the existence of another planet, Vulcan, to explain the observations on the orbit of Mercury.
  Therefore, the answer is B: revising a theory.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

  The passage does not discuss the decrease in ethnic consciousness either.
  The passage indicates that there were variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population.
  The passage also suggests that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses factors that influenced the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  The passage mentions the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States.
  The passage suggests that it is not clear how far the political activism extended beyond the activists.
  The passage does not mention that ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase or when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  The passage mentions that a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create is required to assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  Therefore, the passage supports the statement that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the degree to which the views of Mexican American activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during the period from 1930 to 1960.
  The passage notes that the degree to which Garcia's views are representative of the ethnic Mexican population is unclear and indicates that a better understanding of variables such as patterns of Mexican immigration and naturalization is required.
  The passage does not provide any evidence to support A, C, and D.
  The passage implies that the degree of ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans is influenced by the rate of Mexican immigration and naturalization.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that Garcia's study may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period.
  It is not clear how far the new generation of Mexican American leaders' outlook extended beyond these activists.
  Without a better understanding of variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  Therefore, the passage does not support A, B, C, or D.
  The passage, however, mentions that variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization help to create variations in ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, the passage supports option E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:
Thought:
The phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to costs that are irrelevant to digital publishing and which are not present in digital publishing. The sentence says, "Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expense means that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literary agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds." The next sentence refers to publishers' revenue being absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing physical books, which are costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books. Therefore, it can be concluded that the answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books. 
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that jury nullification can be problematic for several reasons.
  One of the reasons is that juries are not legislators and therefore don't have the authority to interpret the law.
  Passage B argues that nullification can sometimes be justified, for example, when a jury believes that a law is unjust or when a case is too trivial.
  Both passages seem to agree that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate.
  Neither passage discusses the issue of police and prosecutors having less discretion.
  The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  Passage A argues that this is not the role of the jury, while Passage B argues that nullification can be useful in cases where the jury believes that a law is unjust or should not be applied to a particular defendant.
  The answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A and B discuss jury nullification as a safety valve to address overzealousness of prosecutors.
  However, Passage A argues that the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great and that juries have insufficient evidence and lack accountability.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful in indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with a particular law.
  There is no agreement between the two passages on the issue of whether it is within the purview of juries to interpret laws.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A argues against the power of the jury to nullify since it is not required to explain its verdicts and since jurors are unelected, unaccountable and lack the obligation to think through the effect of their acquittal on others.
  
  Passage B argues for the power of the jury to nullify as a safety valve to prosecutors and police discretion and as a means to indicate a possible problem with the law in question. 

  Neither passage focuses on whether juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts or whether elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors. 

  Both passages acknowledge the role of the legislature in creating laws and that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.

  Passage A is critical of juries interpreting the law, while Passage B argues for the power of juries to nullify when the law is unjust.

Based on this analysis, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it. Therefore, the answer is D: It is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A expresses concern about the power of juries to nullify and the negative consequences that may result from unchecked use of this power.
  Passage B argues that juries should have some discretion to nullify in the interest of protecting against overzealous prosecutors and unjust laws.
  The authors seem to agree that jury nullification should not be used indiscriminately, but differ on whether juries should have discretion to nullify in certain cases or whether this power should be limited or eliminated.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  The answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses problems caused by the power of jury nullification.
  Passage B argues that nullification can be a useful function in the legal system.
  The author of Passage A is concerned that juries may use nullification for evil ends and that they do not have sufficient evidence or accountability to use this power wisely.
  The author of Passage B argues that nullification can serve as a safety valve against overzealous enforcement and can provide feedback to the legislature.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree over whether juries should have the power to interpret the law.
  Passage A suggests that the jury is not qualified to interpret the law, while Passage B suggests that nullification can indicate problems with the law. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The first passage describes jury nullification and expresses concern about its misuse.
  The second passage defends jury nullification as a safety valve and argues that it can help indicate when a law is unjust.
  There is no disagreement between the two passages about the need for reasonable people to question the reach of criminal laws.
  Both passages seem to agree that jury nullification can sometimes serve a useful purpose.
  There is also no disagreement about the power of juries to apply the law.
  The authors may disagree about whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion, but this is not the main point of the passages.
  The authors do not comment on the relative biases of elected officials vs. jurors, so it is not relevant.
  The authors of the passages may disagree about whether juries have the right to interpret the law as opposed to applying it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A argues against jury nullification, claiming that their power is great, and they could use it for evil ends.
  Passage B argues in favor of jury nullification as a safety valve when police and prosecutors overreach or when laws are unjust.
  The writer of Passage A believes that juries "have no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others" and that the jury's power should be limited.
  The writer of Passage B believes that juries should have the power to nullify laws and that it can assist the legislature.
  The passages disagree on the issue of whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A argues against jury nullification as it creates problems.
  Passage B supports jury nullification as it is a safety valve and helps the legislature.
  Both passages agree that the jury can be used effectively in the legal system.
  However, they disagree on whether the jury's power to interpret the law is legitimate.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would most likely disagree over choice D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A argues against jury nullification, mainly because of the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great.
  The problems include the unknown usage, insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, and the jury is unelected and unaccountable.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful in certain circumstances, including when the case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction, and when a law is unjust.
  But nullification should be uncommon and only happen in compelling cases.
  Neither of the authors talked about whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue.
  Therefore, the answer is NOT E.
  Also, neither of the authors talked about whether juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts, which means the answer is NOT A.
  The authors, in fact, agree that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.
  Passage A argues that the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated.
  Passage B argues that when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.
  Therefore, the answer is NOT B.
  Passage A argues that juries are not legislators; we have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others.
  Therefore, the authors would disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  The answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that jury nullification is problematic; that it is too often used arbitrarily and for unknown purposes.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can serve as a valuable safety valve. 
  Passage A expresses a negative view of jury nullification, whereas passage B presents a positive view of it.
  The authors of the passage would be most likely to disagree over one of these opposing views.
  The authors do not seem to disagree about A, C, or E.
  The authors' views are explicitly stated in their respective passages, and they are directly opposite in their attitudes about jury nullification.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  The answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The author of the passage argues that, although some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable.
The author also claims that patents could spur basic research because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
Option A describes a reason why scientists might have freely shared research materials in the past, but it does not address the main argument of the passage.
Option B is not supported by the passage since the author argues that a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement exists, and the patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon

  The predictions were not borne out, so they hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan.
  However, Vulcan was never found.
  Some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error and that there might be a disturbing force at play.
  In other words, there might be an additional factor affecting Mercury's orbit, and this could be a "disturbing force."
  Therefore, the answer is D: Mercury.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes how Mercury's orbit did not match the predictions made by scientists using Newton's laws.
  Scientists hypothesized the possibility of another planet called Vulcan near Mercury, but it was never found.
  When the general theory of relativity was introduced, the predictions based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions fit with Mercury's orbit.
  The passage mentions auxiliary premises that are required to derive a theory's predictions.
  It also mentions that an experiment not working out as predicted could have more than one explanation, and one possible explanation is the presence of disturbing forces.
  So, the answer must identify something that can interfere with the orbit of a planet and cause its path to deviate from the expected path.
Action: Answer("E") 
Response 2:
Thought:
  According to passage A, a disturbing force is an auxiliary premise that is needed to derive a theory's predictions.
  Passage B discusses how astronomers were making predictions about the orbit of certain planets with the help of auxiliary premises.
  In the passage, the astronomers found that their predictions were not accurate, leading them to change their auxiliary premise about the existence of other planets.
  Therefore, the answer choice that illustrates the auxiliary premise is the correct answer.
  The answer is D: Mercury.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The question asks about a concept described in Passage A (lines 26-28).
  According to that passage, one source of error in experiments is the presence of "disturbing forces."
  Passage B describes astronomers' attempts to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury.
  In Passage B, one possible explanation for the failure of predictions in the case of Uranus was a disturbance caused by another planet.
  Therefore, the factor described as a "disturbing force" in Passage A is best represented by the hypothesized planet that disrupted the orbit of Uranus.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  In passage B, the astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on auxiliary assumptions.
  One of the assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the prediction did not match the observation, the astronomers changed their assumptions.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune.
  Neptune was the cause of the disturbance force that affected the orbit of Uranus.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage explains how astronomers derived predictions about the orbits of Uranus and Mercury.
  Scientists used auxiliary premises to predict the orbits of Uranus and Mercury.
  The predictions were not borne out, which led scientists to hypothesize the existence of other planets in their vicinity.
  The premise that there were no planets in the vicinity of Uranus was an auxiliary assumption.
  The discovery of Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring the astronomers' calculations into alignment with their observations indicates that the auxiliary assumption about planets' existence was incorrect.
  The identification of another planet in the vicinity of Mercury using Einstein's theory is also an illustration of how auxiliary assumptions can be incorrect.
  The question asks for an example of a "disturbing force."
  None of the planets or the moon seem to be a "disturbing force."
  The sun is not a "disturbing force" either since it is the center around which all planets revolve.
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage explains the discovery of the planet Uranus and its orbit.
  The astronomers predicted the orbit using Newton's laws and some auxiliary assumptions.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the predictions were not correct.
  One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions, and specifically, the assumption that no planets existed near Uranus.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune.
  Therefore, Neptune is the answer as it clearly describes a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage describes the work of astronomers and their predictions about the orbit of planets.
  Passage A defines disturbing force, which is an auxiliary premise that is used in observational predictions.
  Passage B describes auxiliary assumptions, concerning among other things, the masses, orbits and velocities of other planets.
  Uranus, Neptune, and Mercury are all planets orbiting the sun.
  Therefore, the most likely answer choice would be a force not associated with a celestial body, such as the moon.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  In Passage A, the author describes auxiliary premises as additional assumptions required for deriving a theory's predictions, which could be related to the correct functioning of instrumentation or the absence of disturbing forces, etc.
  In Passage B, the author describes how astronomers made predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. However, when the observations did not match the predictions, one possible explanation was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. Hence, the correct answer must illustrate a disturbing force that caused the failure of predictions.
  Among the choices, only the moon is a celestial body that could cause destructive forces, which are regarded as disturbing forces in scientific research. Therefore, the answer is E: the moon.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  In passage A, "disturbing forces" can cause experiments to not work out as predicted, which can lead to more than one possible explanation.
  In passage B, astronomers made predictions about the orbit of Uranus based on auxiliary assumptions. One of the assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  However, the observed orbit was different and failed to match the predictions.
  The astronomers hypothesized that there was another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. 
  This suggests that a possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was an error in the auxiliary assumptions about the existence of the planet.
  Therefore, the answer is E: the moon, as it is the only one of the available choices that is not mentioned in Passage B and could potentially cause disturbances as a force.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?
Choices:
  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.
  B: The primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers aud haudheld devices for reading text.
  C: The growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
  D: Any book will sell more copies ifit is published digitally thau if it is published traditionally.
  E: Digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.

Response 1:
Thought:
The passage suggests that digital publishing will become more popular due to its economic efficiency and convenience. It also suggests that traditional publishers may be reluctant to embrace digital publishing, while upstart digital publishing firms may be able to take advantage of it. However, it does not imply that digital publishing will completely eliminate traditional publishing. Therefore, choice D cannot be correct. The passage also states that digital publication of a book involves no physical inventory, which eliminates the cost of warehousing, shipping, displaying books in retail stores and returning unsold books to publisher. Therefore, choice E is incorrect.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author argues that the new digital model of publishing will be more economically efficient and convenient for customers.
  The author also notes that established publishing houses, initially will be reluctant to switch to digital publishing.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.

  Dostoyevsky was a realist who believed that reality was the crucial source of literature, but his understanding of reality was deeper than the prevailing view that reality was simply what was tangible.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went beyond the tangible, and he believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a work of art must stand or fall on its artistic merits, and that artistry meant the ability to write well and express thoughts in characters and images.
  Dostoyevsky rejected the utilitarian claim that art must be useful to people and society.
  Based on the passage, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would most likely have disagreed with the view that art should further some societal end, so the correct answer is E: "It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end."
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky's view on the position that art should stand high above the present and everyday is not mentioned directly.
  However, it is implied that Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics who believed that art should only be useful.
  He believed that literature's crucial source was reality, but his understanding of reality went deeper than that of the radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky thought that the fantastic should be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.
  For Dostoyevsky, the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky did not agree with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  The answer is D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's view on the position that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position on the issue.
  The passage does not state that Dostoyevsky agreed with this view.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would most likely have disagreed with the statement that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  The answer is not A because the passage does not imply that Dostoyevsky believed that art should have a strong element of the fantastic.
  The answer is not B because the passage does not imply that Dostoyevsky agreed with the view that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  The answer is not C because the passage does not imply that Dostoyevsky believed that reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  The answer is not D because the passage implies that Dostoyevsky believed reality and fantasy are intertwined, so the distinction between them is meaningless.
  The answer is E because the passage implies that Dostoyevsky believed art should not necessarily serve a particular political view.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:
Thought:
  Legal scholars use the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle is the idea that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is determined by weighing the utilities of the possible outcomes, according to the likelihood of each outcome's occurrence, and adding up those weighted utilities.
  An individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  The two crime-deterrence methods (changing societal norms and institutions and increasing fines and penalties) have the same effect because both affect the utility equation.
  Each method affects the expected utility of committing a crime.
  The passage suggests that the use of the utility maximization principle is similar to an astronomer's use of a paradox.
  Therefore, the answer is A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies.

  The passage explains how the utility maximization principle reconciles two positions in the crime deterrence debate by making an individual's decision to commit a crime a rational economic choice.
  The passage does not mention any ancient cosmologists, or any paradox that an astronomer might use in a metaphor.
  The passage does not mention any law of optics from physics, or anything related to drawing instruction.
  The passage does not mention any legendary Olympic athletes, or anything related to botany.
  The passage does talk about legal scholars using an economic principle, the utility maximization principle, to understand how an individual might choose to commit a crime.
  The passage does not mention a judge using evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
  The passage does not mention a mediator using a quotation from a well-known novel to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at a negotiation.
  Therefore, the answer is D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  An individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice under this framework.
  The recommendations of both sides of the debate affect the utility equation.
  The passage does not discuss the use of any paradox, law of optics, quotation from a legendary athlete, evidence from anthropology, or quotation from a novel in the crime deterrence debate.
  Therefore, none of the choices is similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how legal scholars use the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  Utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, people will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The principle is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  This analysis shows that the two positions on crime deterrence, which are increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement, and increasing economic opportunities, are not fundamentally in conflict.
  The principle is used to show that both positions complement each other.
  Therefore, the scenario in the answer choice that is similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate should involve the use of a principle, metaphor, quotation, or evidence to demonstrate how two seemingly opposing concepts are complementary or interact in a surprising way.
  Among the answer choices, the only scenario that seems related to reconciling two opposing views is the judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
  Therefore, the answer is D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage talks about the use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their expected utility.
  A person will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  Thus, the expected utility of an action is determined by weighing the utilities of possible outcomes and the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass.
  This means that the use of the utility maximization principle is a way to analyze a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, the most similar scenario to the use of the utility maximization principle is a scenario where a principle or idea from one field is used to help analyze or explain a phenomenon in another field.
  The scenario in choice D, where a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case, is the most similar scenario.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how using the utility maximization principle helps reconcile the two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  It describes how the two positions are not in conflict and that both sides' proposed methods ultimately affect the expected utility of criminal activity.
  The question asks which scenario is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  None of the answer choices seem to involve a situation where a principle is used to reconcile two opposing views.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage explains the utility maximization principle, which explains that an individual will commit a crime if the expected utility of doing so exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  The use of this principle is similar to a scenario where a principle from one field of knowledge is used to make a point in a different field.
  Option A describes the use of a paradox in astronomy to help describe a phenomenon observed with new technologies, which is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the legal context.
  Option B describes a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other. This is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the legal context.
  Option C describes a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest, which is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the legal context.
  Option D describes a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. This is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the legal context.
  Option E describes a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session, which is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the legal context.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about how the utility maximization principle can help analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime.
  The principle compares the expected utility from doing an action to the expected utility from the outcome of that action.
  Two positions in the debate would be increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, or increasing the economic opportunities of the most economically alienated individuals.
  Both these positions affect the utility equation and make individuals less likely to commit deliberate crimes.
  This principle is similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in deterrence.
  None of the other scenarios seem to be related to the principle.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to reconcile the two positions regarding crime deterrence.
  The utility maximization principle is an economic principle that ascertains an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  Two methods of crime deterrence result in the same overall effect, decreasing expected utility from criminal activity.
  Increasing the expected utility from lawful activity also affects the utility equation.
  Legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle to reconcile the two positions regarding crime deterrence is similar to using one principle or theory from one field to solve a problem in another field.
  None of the given choices in the question resembles this scenario the most.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Legal scholars use the utility maximization principle in the debate over deterrence methods.
  The principle says rational people choose the action that maximizes their expected satisfaction.
  The principle can analyze crime as a rational economic choice by weighing the costs and benefits of criminal and lawful actions.
  Both sides of the debate may increase the expected utility from lawful activity or decrease the expected utility from criminal activity.
  The two positions are not fundamentally in conflict in deterring crime.
  There is no mention of any scenario similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage explains that scientists had compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission between 1934 and 1939 before Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection. However, researchers were not receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  There are a few factors that hindered the recognition of nuclear fission. One of them is the expectation that the products would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Another is the lack of precise chemical analyses due to the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials. 
  To reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split, one of the factors above should change.
  (A) is unlikely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split as using the same research techniques may not necessarily lead to faster understanding of the results.
  (B) is a possible choice as the expectation that the products would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition hindered the recognition of nuclear fission. If the physicists conducting the experiments did not have such expectations, they might recognize the significance of the research results earlier.
  (C) is less likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split as this information was known to theoretical physicists even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  (D) may not help to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split if the experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result.
  (E) is less likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split as experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium might produce different results that may not be relevant to nuclear fission.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage emphasizes the role of recognizing the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  The physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, if the physicists had been more aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, they might have recognized what they were witnessing sooner.
  The answer is C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage states that researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  The researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission could happen.
  One reason for this was the expectation that all the by-products would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data and submitted her conclusion for publication, coining the term "nuclear fission."
  More physicists concentrating on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium might have led to quicker realization of nuclear fission.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that the researchers were not receptive to the possibility of atomic nuclei being split by neutron-bombardment.
  The researchers were not even aware that the theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Meitner was able to connect the dots between the experimental data and the theoretical calculations made by earlier physicists.
  Therefore, if the researchers had been aware of the theoretical calculations indicating that in principle, atoms could be broken apart, they might have recognized the significance of their experimental data earlier.
  A, B, D, and E are not related to the awareness of theoretical calculations.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage explains how the physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing. 
  They did not expect the results that showed that they had split an atom. 
  Meitner's research provided the crucial theoretical connection between the experimental data and the concept of splitting an atom. 
  Therefore, if the physicists had not had certain expectations regarding the results of their experiments, they might have realized sooner that they were splitting atoms. 
  Choice B states this explicitly. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that physicists were not expecting uranium atoms to split when they first conducted experiments of neutron bombardment.
  Once uranium atoms were split, physicists realized that they had previously observed evidence of nuclear fission that they had not recognized before.
  If physicists conducting experiments had not held the common view that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse, then they might have been more receptive to the possibility that uranium atoms could be split.
  Option A, B, and D do not address the physicists' common view and do not seem likely to reduce the amount of time needed to realize that atoms were being split.
  Option E is not relevant to the neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Therefore, C is the most appropriate choice. If physicists had been aware of calculations indicating it was possible to split atoms, they might have been more receptive to the possibility of uranium atoms splitting, and could have more quickly recognized the evidence of nuclear fission that they were observing.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that physicists were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms during the neutron-bombardment experiments.
  The passage also notes that the Italian and German physicists were not able to identify the resulting products of their experiments with high precision, partly due to the minute quantities of those substances.
  Therefore, if the physicists had been able to identify their results more precisely, it may have reduced the amount of time it took for them to realize they were splitting atoms.
  Choice A, B, C, and E do not directly relate to this observation.
  Choice D suggests that more physicists conducting the experiments could have provided more data, but it is not clear whether this would have helped with the identification of the resulting products.
  Therefore, the answer is D: More physicists concentrated on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that the physicists failed to recognize the significance of the data because they did not have the right conceptual link.
  To reduce the amount of time it took to realize that atoms were being split, then, the physicists would have needed a way to make the right conceptual link sooner.
  Answer choice B suggests that the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, which means that they might have been more open to recognizing the significance of the data.
  Answer choice A does not seem relevant to the question.
  Answer choice C contradicts a point made in the passage: some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle, it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Answer choice D would not necessarily have led to researchers identifying the significance of the data.
  Answer choice E is not relevant to the question.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The question asks what would most likely reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  The passage explains that the researchers had increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved but they did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations and quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper co-authored with physicist Otto Frisch.
  Therefore, if the physicists had focused more on theoretical considerations or had fewer expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they may have realized that atoms were being split sooner.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage states that the evidence of nuclear fission was present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
  The physicists were compiling increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved before Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical link.
  The products resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified partly because researchers expected that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  The answer should identify a factor that would have improved the likelihood of physicists realizing that they were splitting uranium atoms.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question asks for an assertion from passage A that exemplifies the author of passage B's idea of evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory.
  Passage B suggests that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it attributes behavior to a hidden intention of propagating genes.
  Passage A describes how genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This idea of hidden intention aligns with the author of passage B's characterization of evolutionary psychology.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory".
  It criticizes the idea of explaining behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not acknowledge.
  Passage A suggests that genes promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This implies that there may be an interest that explains a particular behavior.
  Therefore, D: "Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish" is an assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and how it seeks to explain human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint.
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory in which an interest (gene propagation) is imputed to an agent's behavior without that agent being aware of it.
  The assertion that best exemplifies the perspective of passage B is the one that implies that evolutionary psychology attributes motives or interests to human behavior without acknowledging them.
  The assertion that most clearly exemplifies the perspective of passage B is that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The question requires us to find an assertion in Passage A that exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
Passage B claims that evolutionary psychology explains behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. 
Passage A argues that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother rushing to help her injured child. 
The author of Passage B might see this explanation of altruistic behavior, in which the urge to help one's child is ultimately motivated by the desire to propagate one's genes, as an example of a "conspiracy theory".

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" that imputes hidden interests to behavior.
  The example given in Passage B does not directly relate to the assertion made in one of the answer choices.
  The idea that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish fits in with the characterization of evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory".
  Therefore, the assertion in Passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A provides an explanation of how evolutionary psychology uses the theory of evolution to explain human behavior.
  Passage B criticizes the practice of explaining behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not acknowledge or is not aware of.
  This is what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory.
  Passage A gives an example of how genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This example best exemplifies the idea of imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not acknowledge or is not aware of.
  The answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory that explains behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not acknowledge.
  Passage A suggests that genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Therefore, D: "Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish" is the assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it explains behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge.
  The phrase "genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves" in passage B is an example of this.
  The answer choice that best exemplifies this feature is the one that describes evolutionary psychology as imputing an interest.
  Choice D describes how genes promote their own self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This is an example of evolutionary psychology imputing an interest to genes that individuals exhibiting the behavior do not openly acknowledge.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that human behavior is shaped by the interest of our genes in self-propagation.
  The author of passage B criticizes the idea that we should impute such interest to individuals who exhibit the behavior.
  Therefore, the assertion that most exemplifies passage B's criticism is the one that implies that evolutionary psychology baselessly attributes hidden interests to individuals.
  The idea that the evolution of altruism is thorny because it involves actions that do not appear to benefit oneself is a good example of how evolutionary psychology assumes hidden interests that shape behavior.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question asks for an example from passage A of what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
  According to passage B, evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it "explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of."
  This implies that evolutionary psychology imputes motives to humans that are hidden and manipulative, much like a conspiracy theory.
  The assertion in passage A that best exemplifies this is D, "genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish".
  This implies that human behavior is not entirely self-directed, but rather is subtly influenced by genetic motives that the individual is not consciously aware of, much like a conspiracy theory.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon
  C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  D: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to introduce the main topic to be discussed
  E: to introduce the main topic to be discussed to present a view that will be argued against
Response 0:
Thought:
  The purpose of mentioning the Solnick and Hemenway study in Passage A is to provide evidence that people are concerned about their relative position and their "reference group" when it comes to happiness.
  The purpose of mentioning the Solnick and Hemenway study in Passage B is to argue against the idea that we care most about one-upmanship and to provide evidence that earning more makes people happier because of a desire to create value.
  Therefore, Passage A and Passage B mention the Solnick and Hemenway study for different purposes.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A talks about how people compare their income with some norm and that the norm must be rising along with actual income, leading to two phenomena. One of these phenomena, rivalry, is described through Solnick and Hemenway's study.
  Passage B talks about why earning more makes people happier, and it refers to Solnick and Hemenway's study to argue for a specific explanation of the phenomenon.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B respectively mentioned the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon and to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
  The answer is D: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to introduce the main topic to be discussed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A presents research about the paradox of happiness and wealth. 
  It mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to explain the phenomenon of rivalry and how people compare themselves to others.
  Passage B presents a different view, which is that earning more money makes people happy because it makes them feel successful and that they have created value. 
  The authors mention the Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for this view.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A mention the Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon, and the authors of Passage B mention the Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in both passages A and B.
  We need to determine why each author used this study.
  Passage A uses the study to show that people compare themselves to others and care about relative status.
  Passage B uses the study to argue that the desire to create value and a sense of success is what ultimately brings happiness, rather than the desire for one-upmanship.
  Therefore, the authors of passage A and passage B mention the Solnick and Hemenway study to respectively provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon and to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A describes a research on happiness and wealth, which reveals two phenomena that push up the norm: habituation and rivalry.
  It also describes the importance of people's relative position on their happiness.
  Passage B presents an alternative explanation for why earning more makes people happier, arguing that it is the success—not the money itself—that provides happiness.
  The passage then references the Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for this explanation.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage B mention the study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon, while the authors of Passage A mention the study to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A and passage B have different perspectives on why earning more money makes people happier.
  The authors of Passage A mentioned the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for the role of relative prosperity in happiness.
  The authors of Passage B mentioned the same study to present a view that will be argued against, that earning more money is mainly about one-upmanship.
  Therefore, the answer is A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A describes how people compare their income with some norm.
  To support the idea of relative prosperity, passage A cites the study by Solnick and Hemenway showing that people prefer earning less money if their relative position improves.
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they have created value.
  To support this argument, passage B mentions the study by Solnick and Hemenway showing that earning more money makes people feel more successful.
  Therefore, the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon and to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A and passage B both mention the Solnick and Hemenway study.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in passage A to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in passage B to provide additional evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
  Therefore, the answer is C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The authors of passage A mention Solnick and Hemenway's study to provide evidence that people compare themselves with others to determine their happiness.
  The authors of passage B mention Solnick and Hemenway's study to argue against the theory that people care most about one-upmanship.
  The two passages serve different purposes in mentioning the Solnick and Hemenway study.
  The best answer is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A and passage B discuss different explanations for the correlation between income and happiness.
  Passage A introduces the study by Solnick and Hemenway to show that relative prosperity is crucial for happiness.
  Passage B mentions the same study to argue against the idea that people care most about one-upmanship.
  Therefore, the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon and to present a view that will be argued against.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author states that scientists conducting basic and noncommercial research are usually protected from patent infringement lawsuits.
  Therefore, the researcher is unlikely to be sued by the corporation holding the patent for patent infringement.
  However, the author also suggests that the corporation holding the patent may refuse to make the cell lines available unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken.
  Therefore, the researcher may face difficulties accessing the patented cell lines.
  The author does not suggest that the corporation will offer to fund the research.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that there is a tradition amongst judges to respect completely noncommercial research as an exception to patent infringement.
  Also, the author mentions that patents provide scientists with incentives to innovate.
  The passage also highlights that there is a perceived threat to basic research from restrictions on access to research materials.
  The passage argues that it is unlikely that a patent holder would be able to restrict noncommercial research.
  Therefore, it is most likely that the researcher would not be held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that researchers conducting basic, noncommercial research using patented materials may be able to do so without fear of legal action.
  While patent holders may charge fees for the use of patented materials, it is not clear that they will charge prohibitively high fees.
  Furthermore, judges have recognized a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Therefore, the author would most likely predict that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. 
  This means that patent infringement for noncommercial research is usually not done.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 0:
Thought:
The author criticizes the modular theory of mind.
The author explains how the subtractive method is used to create FMRI images.
The author believes that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
The passage does not suggest that the author agrees with the modular theory of mind.
The passage does not suggest that the author believes the results derived from the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications.
Choice B suggests that the subtractive method supports Uttal's view, but the passage only discusses how the method obscures general brain activity.
Choice C is incorrect, as the passage does not suggest that emotions are not seated in the amygdala.
Given the author's criticism of the modular theory of mind, the author is not likely to believe that the subtractive method supports modular theory.
Choice E is incorrect. The passage provides an explanation of the subtractive method.
Therefore, the best answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage explains that the subtractive method produces images of the brain and is a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain. However, it is problematic because it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions (baseline and cognitive task). The subtractive method subtracts out all the distributed brain functions, making it seem like the results are limited to specific areas. This gives the false impression of neat functional localization, which supports the modular theory of mind. The passage does not suggest that the subtractive method is invalid for medical applications, nor that it supports Uttal's view that mental processes are properties of a general mental activity. There is also no mention of the specific brain regions related to emotions. Given these points, the best answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage explains what brain scans can and cannot tell us about the brain.
  The combination of a baseline and cognitive task measurement using the subtractive method produces clear images of localized brain function.
  However, the validity of modular theory of mind, on which neuroimaging relies, is questionable.
  The passage does not suggest that empirical results from the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications.
  The passage does not suggest that the subtractive method supports Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of general mental activity.
  The passage does not discuss scans of emotions specifically.
  The passage argues that the subtractive method produces images that may support the modular theory of mind, creating an illusion of neat functional localization despite distributed brain functions.
  Therefore, the author would be likely to agree with D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage describes that the subtractive method provides neat functional localization but does not show the entire picture of brain activity.
The passage does not mention that empirical results from the method are invalid for medical applications.
The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind is not supported by the subtractive method.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage provides critical analysis of the modular theory of mind in relation to brain scans.
  It argues that brain scans do not straightforwardly support this theory.
  Rather, the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) creates an illusion of neat functional localization.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both control and task conditions.
  The reasoning behind the subtractive method is problematic, as it assumes that whatever remains after subtraction is solely associated with cognitive tasks.
  The author would likely agree that the subtractive method is flawed in this respect.
  Option A is incorrect as the passage does not suggest that empirical results derived using the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications.
  Option B is incorrect as the passage offers critique of the modular theory of mind and suggests that the subtractive method creates an illusion of neat functional localization.
  Option C is incorrect. It is inconsistent with the passage's argument that the amygdala is not the seat of emotion in the brain.
  The correct answer is D. The passage suggests that the subtractive method creates an illusion of functional localization, which could be seen as strongly supporting the modular theory of mind. However, as the author argues, this method does not necessarily reflect how the mind is truly organized. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage explains that the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work.
  It is also noted that the method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both control and task conditions.
  In contrast, Uttal argues that mental processes are not distinct entities located in particular brain regions.
  Therefore, the author would likely not view the subtractive method as strongly supporting the modular theory of mind.
  Based on this reasoning, the best answer is B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the subtractive method as a way to depict metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question by subtracting a baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
  The author criticizes the subtractive method for obscuring the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control condition and the cognitive task condition.
  The author does not suggest that empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  The author also does not suggest that brain scans produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  The author criticizes the subtractive method for creating an illusion of neat functional localization, which seems to support the modular theory of mind.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
 The passage discusses the shortcomings and limitations of the modular theory of mind and brain scans. The subtractive method is used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), which is a type of brain scan.

Option A is incorrect, as the author does not argue that the empirical results derived using the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications. 
Option B is incorrect, as the author does not suggest that the subtractive method supports Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity. 
Option C is incorrect, as the author does not discuss brain scans of individuals experiencing anger. 
Option D is incorrect, as the author argues that the subtractive method creates an illusion of functional localization and does not strongly support the modular theory of mind. 
Option E is incorrect, as the author does not argue that the view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
The best answer is D, as the author argues that the subtractive method creates an illusion of functional localization and does not strongly support the modular theory of mind. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
The author discusses the subtractive method used in FMRI scans and provides a critique of the method.
According to the author, the subtractive method does not provide a true reflection of the brain's functions because it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
The author does not seem to support the modular theory of mind and argues that the method used in the scans creates an illusion of localized brain functions.
Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that the subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the subtractive method as a way to interpret functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) results.
  The subtractive method involves taking a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task, and then subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
  One problem of the subtractive method is that it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions.
  The author does not argue that the subtractive method provides invalid empirical results for medical applications.
  The author does not argue that the subtractive method supports Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  The author does not argue that brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  The statement that the subtractive method strongly supports the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized is incorrect because the problem of the subtractive method is that it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is not a fundamental misconception of the method.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise that the validity of neuroimaging in psychology depends on.
  The modular theory of mind proposes that modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The critique by William Uttal claims that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  The subtractive method of brain scanning produces striking images of the brain but also obscures that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The FMRI measures the differential rate of oxygen use when a subject is performing some cognitive task.
  It is not the case that all cognitive tasks depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  The regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task still have a rate of oxygen use that is not close to zero.
  During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a higher rate of oxygen use than that of the rest of the brain.
  The subtractive method of brain scanning does not show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
  The passage does not mention anything specific about the brain scan subject experiencing anger.
  Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a method of analyzing the mind.
  According to the modular theory of mind, distinct mental processes are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  However, it is possible that mental activity is not decomposable in this way, and instead is a more general activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  Brain scans reveal well-defined areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks.
  The FMRI is a subtraction method that measures the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the modular theory of mind, which represents mental activity as a collection of independent modules in specific brain regions.
  However, the psychologist William Uttal challenges this theory by suggesting that mental processes are likely properties of general mental activity distributed throughout the brain.
  The passage also describes how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) produces a map of the rate of oxygen use in the brain, which represents metabolic activity.
  The first measurement is taken in the control condition, and the second measurement is taken during a cognitive task. 
  The baseline measurement is subtracted from the measurement during the cognitive task to reveal the metabolic activity associated solely with that task.
  Therefore, answer choice C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain is most strongly supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that the modular theory of mind is a premise that the mind can be divided into distinct modules and that these modules are located in the specific brain regions.
  The passage also explains that the critique of the modular theory of mind contends that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  The passage further explains that when we look at a brain scan, what we are seeing is actually the differential rate of oxygen use, and the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, it can be concluded that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. 
  Hence, the answer is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage doesn't support option A since it argues that mental activity is likely not decomposable into independent modules.
  Option B is incorrect since the passage doesn't mention anything about regions of the brain not engaged in specific cognitive tasks having a near-zero rate of oxygen use.
  Option C is directly supported by information given in the passage. During the performance of cognitive tasks, more active areas of the brain show a higher rate of oxygen use than other areas.
  Option D is incorrect since the passage doesn't provide any information about the baseline measurements of oxygen use showing some regions of the brain as having high metabolic activity at all times.
  Option E is incorrect since the passage doesn't mention anything about the specific regions of the brain involved in anger.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
- The passage talks about the critiques of the modular theory of mind.
- It also explains the logic behind the subtractive method in brain scans.
- The passage does mention that there are well-defined areas that "light up" in response to cognitive tasks, however, it also critiques the idea that mental processes are decomposable into independent modules.
- The passage explains that the entire brain is active in both conditions (baseline and on-task).
- The passage does not support choice A. There is a critique of the modular theory of mind presented in the passage.
- The passage does not support choice B. It is not mentioned anywhere that the rate of oxygen use of regions not engaged in a specific cognitive task is close to zero.
- The passage does support choice C. It is mentioned in the passage that "the FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity". It is also mentioned that "whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question".
- The passage does not support choice D. It is not mentioned anywhere that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
- The passage does not support choice E. Specifically, it is not mentioned anywhere that anger lights up several regions of the brain.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
The passage describes the use of brain scans and challenges the premise of the modular theory of mind. 
The modular theory of mind states that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is one of the methods used for brain scans, and it produces striking images of the brain at work based on a subtraction method.
The entire brain is active in both conditions used by the subtraction method.
Therefore, Option C appears to be the most strongly supported statement by the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the modular theory of mind as a premise for neuroimaging in psychology.
  The modular theory of mind holds that themind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  Psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  Brain scans in fact reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks.
  In the case of FMRI, the differential rate of oxygen use is used to illustrate metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  However, the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work but obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, based on the passage, statement C is the most strongly supported.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage explains that brain scans use a subtractive method for displaying areas of the brain that experience greater metabolic activity during a cognitive task, and that the theory of modular mind breaks down cognition into specific modules located in individual regions of the brain. However, the text explains that research indicates that mental processes are likely a property of distributed brain functions, and that clean separation of emotion and reason-giving generally makes a hash of human experience.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
The passage explains that the modular theory of mind may not be valid. The FMRI is a method that takes a baseline measurement and subtracts it from a second measurement when the subject is performing a cognitive task. The resulting image shows the differential rate of oxygen use, which is the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task. However, the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. 
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The best works of art improve with age.
  E: Some forms of art are superior to others.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author discusses the similarities between painting and perfume making.
  Both use natural and synthetic compounds to create complex combinations.
  The appearance of paintings changes over time, and similarly, perfumes change over time as they evaporate on the skin.
  Perfume making can create an imaginary world and bring about memories, similar to what a great painting can do.
  The author also criticizes the corporate interference in perfume making and marketing.
  The passage does not provide support for the superiority of one form of art over another.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage discusses the art of perfumery in comparison to painting and music.
The author notes the similarities between painting and perfumery, as well as music and perfumery.
The author argues that perfumes are undervalued due to the influence of corporations that replace rare, better ingredients with cheaper chemical compounds to increase profits.
The author also suggests that perfumes have the capacity to evoke memories.
The passage does not offer an exhaustive view of art, but rather focuses on the art of perfumery and its relationship to painting and music.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between traditional art forms like painting and newer art forms like perfume making. 
  The author argues that perfumes are just as capable of bringing about aesthetic experiences as other art forms. 
  The passage suggests that the lack of regard for perfumes as an art form may be due to the fact that they are produced for commercial purposes. 
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for choice A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage compares painting and perfumery and highlights their similarities in artistic techniques.
The passage also discusses the creation of a work of art in a way that is not motivated by commercial gain.
The comparison between painting and perfume is used to highlight the potential beauty of perfume as an art form, rather than arguing that one art form is superior to another.
Therefore, the passage provides the most support for choice A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume-making.
  Both painting and perfume-making involve combining natural and synthetic compounds to produce an aesthetic experience.
  Painters layer oil paint to create a painting, while perfumers layer olfactory elements to create a scent.
  The appearance of a painting changes over time due to the properties of oil paint, while the scent of a perfume changes over time due to the properties of its chemical compounds.
  Both painting and perfume-making can evoke memories and emotions.
  The passage does not discuss the superiority of one form of art over another or the commercial success of art.
  Therefore, the answer is neither D nor E, and the best answer is A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage compares the art of painting to the art of perfumery.
  Both involve combining natural and synthetic elements to produce a final product that can evoke sensory experiences.
  The passage also suggests that the commercialization of perfume has led to a decline in quality.
  Therefore, the passage does not support either option A or D.
  The passage does not make any value judgments about the relative merits of painting and perfumery, so option E is also incorrect.
  The passage does not make a statement about any work of art being destined to fail if created for commercial purposes, so option C is also not supported.
  The passage does suggest that in any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations and that a brilliant perfumer may devise an imaginary world no less powerful than a great painter or composer.
  Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the parallel between painting and perfume.
  Painters and perfumers employ similar techniques to create their respective art forms.
  Perfumers create an imaginary world of scents that can evoke memories.
  In calling on our capacity to discover a memory through scent, perfumers are in the same business as artists who create the illusion of life on canvas.
  Therefore, the passage supports statement A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
The passage discusses the parallels between perfumery and painting as examples of sister arts. 
It explains that both rely on the combination of various components that work together to create a final product, and that both can create powerful experiences. 
The passage also explains that the quality of perfumes is threatened by the increasing role of large corporations that prefer to substitute cheaper, less effective ingredients for the sake of profit. 
None of this suggests that one form of art is superior to another, nor does it suggest that creating a work for the sake of commercial success is inevitably doomed to failure. 
However, the passage does suggest that the memories evoked by a work of art can contribute to its inherent aesthetic value.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about the similarities between different forms of art, including painting and perfume, in terms of the combination of natural and synthetic elements to create an aesthetic experience.
  It also describes the way in which perfumes can evoke memories and create an imaginary world, and suggests that perfumers and artists are in the same business of creating an illusion of life.
  However, the passage does not make any explicit claims about the superiority of one art form over another, the commercial success of art, or whether art improves with age.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Thought:

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.
  D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he condueted.
  E: Though he composed and condueted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.
Response 0:
Thought:
The main point of the passage is the discovery of an entirely new class of infectious pathogens in the form of prions, capable of reproducing themselves without any genetic material and causing diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and the possible link of protein malformation to other neurological conditions.

  The main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has led to the discovery of prions, an entirely new class of infectious pathogens that can cause other degenerative neurological conditions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes research into identifying the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which led to the discovery of a protein pathogen called "prion".
  Prions are unique in that they lack nucleic acid and consist mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  Prions exist naturally in the body as proteins, and they possess the ability to convert their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape, leading to a cascade of transformations that produces a plaque in the brain, ultimately destroying nerve cells.
  Prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens, and they may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
  The main point of the passage is therefore about the discovery of prions as a new type of pathogen that is responsible for CJD and the possibility that it may be involved in other neurological conditions as well.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that all behavior is caused by the brain and questions the idea of moral responsibility.
  Passage B talks about determinism and soft determinism which suggests that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.
  Ayer argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources.
  Mental disorders such as kleptomania can cause constrained actions.
  Therefore, the concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A is Mental disorder.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that the operations of the brain alone cause behavior, which suggests that people may not be making truly free choices.
  Passage A suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms and abandon the idea of retribution.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.
  In Passage B, Ayer argues that free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will, and that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Mental disorder is mentioned in Passage B as an example of a mental condition that can cause constrained actions.
  Free choice is discussed in both passages.
  Causality is discussed in both passages.
  Self-delusion is discussed in Passage A.
  Moral responsibility is discussed in Passage A as the basis of the idea of retribution.
  Therefore, the answer is A: mental disorder.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A presents the idea that free and rational moral choices may not be truly free and rational since they are influenced by the brain.
  Passage A suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing bad people for their immoral choices.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.
  Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" suggests that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  According to Ayer, constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania.
  Therefore, mental disorder is the concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that what we perceive as free choice might not be so because our brains make decisions based on emotional responses instead of logic.
  Passage A suggests that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms, which means reducing the severity of punishment in some cases.
  Passage B discusses the concept of "soft determinism," which argues that a person can still act freely even in a deterministic world.
  Passage B distinguishes between free and constrained actions and argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Passage B suggests that actions originating from a disease-free brain are free.
  Mental disorder is mentioned in both passagess.
  Causality is mentioned in both passages.
  Self-delusion is mentioned in Passage A.
  Moral responsibility is mentioned in Passage A.
  The only concept mentioned in Passage B but not in Passage A is free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses recent findings in neuroscience that suggest that people may not be making free and rational moral choices.
  It proposes that, instead of focusing on retribution for bad actions, the law should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses how free will can coexist with determinism, using the concept of "soft determinism" and distinguishing between free and constrained actions.
  The concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A is the idea of "constrained actions".
  Passage B specifically discusses how constrained actions are caused by external sources and how free actions are those caused by internal sources.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that "you are your brain" and nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain, which implies that free will might be an illusion, and therefore moral responsibility is not the best justification for punishment.
  Passage B argues that even in a deterministic world, free actions caused by internal sources can still coexist with determinism, and the source of the cause determines whether an action is free, which implies that moral responsibility and free will are still valid concepts, especially when actions are not constrained. 
  According to the above analysis, the answer should be B or E.
  The concept of moral responsibility was explicitly discussed in passage A, so E is not the answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that behavior is caused by the operations of the brain.
  Based on neuroscience, the law should focus on deterrence instead of retribution. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of "soft determinism" and the possibility of free will in a deterministic world.
  The concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A is the concept of "free choice".
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
Passage A is about how neuroscientific findings may change how people think about the law, suggesting that bad people should be punished for the purpose of deterring future harms, instead of as retribution for their freely chosen immoral acts.
Passage B is about the possibility of free will in a deterministic world and the definition of free and constrained actions.
Passage A does not mention any concept related to the definition of free and constrained actions, which are the topic of Passage B. Hence, we can eliminate choices B, D, and E.
Passage A talks about the behavior of rational or irrational people, caused by brain operations, whereas passage B discusses free and constrained actions originating from a healthy brain or mental disorders. Hence, a mental disorder is only relevant to passage B.
Choice A: mental disorder
Choice C: causality
The argument of both passages involves causality as they both discuss the impact of brain operations on behavior, although they do so in different ways. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that the operations of the brain cause behavior, suggesting that retribution should be abandoned in favor of deterrence.
  Passage B argues that actions can still be free even in a deterministic world, meaning that actions caused by one's own will are free.
  Passage A does not discuss "free choice" as a concept, but Passage B argues that free actions are caused by internal sources, by one's own will.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that humans are not free and rational when making moral choices.
  Therefore, passage A suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution and instead focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.
  Passage B defines free actions as those caused by internal sources, by one's own will.
  Passage B distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
  Therefore, the concept of free choice plays a role in passage B but not in passage A.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

  However, the author notes that it was only after Lise Meitner made a crucial theoretical connection in 1939 that the relevant evidence was identified.
  Later, the author describes the specific evidence that led Meitner and Frisch to conclude that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms: the fact that the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.
  Therefore, the answer is D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The "relevant evidence" in the passage refers to the data which scientists had been amassing regarding the splitting of uranium atoms, without realizing that they were witnessing nuclear fission.
  The author states that the evidence had been present for some time, but had lacked the right conceptual link.
  None of the previous options accurately describes the "relevant evidence".
  Only choice A correctly identifies the evidence as the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which had provided numerous similar results in the production of radioactive substances, but was not understood as nuclear fission at the time.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The author refers to "the relevant evidence" in line 62.
  The discovery of nuclear fission happened because "the relevant evidence" was finally recognized and given the right conceptual link.
  The author mentions a few key pieces of evidence that were discovered over time, but the evidence that led to the ultimate realization of fission is most likely the one referred to as "the relevant evidence."
  This evidence is described as something that had been present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The only answer choice that satisfies these conditions is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author mentions relevant evidence that had been present for some time.
  The relevant evidence is clearly defined as the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  This means the evidence proves the underlying theoretical concept.
  Meitner was the one who recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence is the data that proved nuclear fission was taking place in uranium, which had been observed by the researchers but was not recognized without the appropriate theoretical framework.
  This means that the relevant evidence is best represented by the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted between 1934 and 1939.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The relevant evidence was present for some time.
  The author explains the evidence earlier in the passage.
  The evidence consists of the radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Among these substances, barium was identified, which led to the realization that uranium atoms were being split.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence (line 62) is the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  The answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
The phrase "the relevant evidence" (line 62) refers to something that has been present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link. 
This evidence led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
Lines 55-61 provide a detailed description of the evidence, which is the identification of barium as a product of neutron bombardment of uranium. 
Therefore, the answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The relevant evidence the author talks about is the evidence that was present for some time, but they lacked the right conceptual link to understand it.
  In the last paragraph, it is mentioned that the scientists rushed to corroborate the findings after Meitner recognized the significance of the data.
  This indicates that the relevant evidence was something that could be corroborated by the scientists after Meitner's conclusions.
  Out of the given choices, only the evidence mentioned in option C fits the criteria.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The "relevant evidence" that the author refers to must have been present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was made by analyzing the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  However, the discovery was not made until 1939, after Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  Hahn's discovery of barium being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium was a surprising result, but it provided clear chemical evidence of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" that was present must refer to the evidence that was key in recognizing nuclear fission.
  The key evidence was the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The relevant evidence that the author is referring to is something that had been present for some time. 
  The author mentions that Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, but Hahn provided the clear chemical evidence of what had happened.
  Thus, the relevant evidence must be the clear chemical evidence of barium's production.
  The answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The author uses the phrase "the relevant evidence" (line 62) to describe the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission is discussed in the passage.
  The discovery of nuclear fission occurred when researchers split uranium atoms.
  Meitner recognized that the researchers had been splitting uranium atoms.
  Meitner coined the term "nuclear fission."
  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" (line 62) is the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission, which is the results of the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art.
  The passage points out that Lichtenstein's work conveyed a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody.
  Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it.
  Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
  Lichtenstein's work exuded a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in some other pop artists.
  The answer choice which would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein is the one that contradicts or invalidates one or more of the above points.
  Answer choice A does not necessarily affect the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer choice B is not consistent with what the passage describes of Lichtenstein's attitude toward abstract expressionism.
  Answer choice C does not necessarily affect the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer choice D is not consistent with what the passage describes of Lichtenstein's attitude toward emotion in painting.
  Answer choice E, if true, would challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, for it states that Lichtenstein criticized pop artists for producing paintings void of emotion, which contradicts what the passage describes as Lichtenstein's intentional "deliberate naivete." 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as a painter who combined popular genres with fine art, and conveyed both parody and realism in his work.
  To challenge the author's characterization, we need to find a statement that contradicts or weakens these aspects of his work.
  Option A is not relevant to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Option B suggests that Lichtenstein appreciated emotional paintings, which does not contradict the author's characterization of his work.
  Option C is also not relevant, as it refers to an early generation of abstract expressionists and not the second generation that Lichtenstein rebelled against.
  Option D refers to emotional paintings made by a pop artist, which again does not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Option E could potentially challenge the author's characterization, but it suggests that Lichtenstein criticized paintings without emotion, which is not the same as saying that he did not convey true feeling in his own work.
  Therefore, none of the options significantly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a rebellion against abstract expressionism.
  The passage suggests that Lichtenstein's work is not aloof from or ignoring abstract expressionism, but rather in dialogue with it.
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein's work as having a deliberate naivete and inner sweetness.
  The question asks which one of the following would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer choice A is plausible, but it's unclear how frequently attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters would contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer choice B is also plausible, but Lichtenstein praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting would not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer choice C could actually reinforce the author's characterization of Lichtenstein by suggesting that he values emotional paintings.
  Answer choice D would not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein since criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings would be consistent with Lichtenstein's work having a deliberate naivete.
  Answer choice E would also not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein since criticizing a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion would be consistent with Lichtenstein's work having an inner sweetness.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein's work as displaying "an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life."
  The author also characterizes Lichtenstein's work as possessing a "kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists."
  Therefore, any answer indicating that Lichtenstein did not believe that contemporary life should be depicted, or that he did not think that there was too much sophistication in art, would challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer choice D and E are not valid because Lichtenstein criticizing someone for producing emotional paintings void or full, is not related to the author's characterization.
  Answer choice A and B are not valid because Lichtenstein attending exhibitions or praising someone for producing atypically emotional paintings does not directly challenge the author's characterization.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein as a painter who combined popular genres with the forms and intentions of fine art. He conveyed a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. So, any statement that contradicts the above-stated points would challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Analysis:
  A: Attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s would not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as it does not relate to his intentions in creating his artwork.
  B: Praising a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting might show that Lichtenstein had a liking for emotional paintings, but it does not directly contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  C: Praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings would also not directly contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  D: Criticizing a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings is not significant enough to challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  E: Criticizing a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion also does not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
Conclusion:
  None of the above options would directly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. However, option B suggests that Lichtenstein valued paintings with emotional depth, which is indirectly related to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a merger between popular genre with forms and intentions of fine art that convey a seriousness of theme.
  Lichtenstein's work was part of general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it.
  Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
  Lichtenstein's work exuded a kind of deliberate naivete intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists.
  Therefore, if Lichtenstein praised an abstract expressionist for producing an emotional painting or criticized a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion, it may challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein as merging popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art to make art that conveys a seriousness of theme that enables it to transcend mere parody.
  It also states that he rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism with a deliberate naivete intended as a response to the excess of sophistication.
  Choice A does not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as it only states that Lichtenstein attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, which could be for many reasons.
  Choice B, praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting, does not challenge the characterization either because Lichtenstein might appreciate emotional paintings of any style.
  Choice C, praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, does not challenge the characterization of Lichtenstein's work as a response to the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism's later generation.
  Choice D, criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings, does not challenge the characterization either since Lichtenstein's work is described as displaying an impulse toward realism and an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
  Choice E, criticizing a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion, somewhat challenges the author's characterization as Lichtenstein's work is described as having a deliberate naivete intended as a response to the excess of sophistication, suggesting that Lichtenstein might value emotion in art. 
  Therefore, choice E is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of comic book style and fine art, that conveyed both a seriousness of theme and a nostalgia for contemporary life.
  The author argues that Lichtenstein's work was a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  The author states that if Lichtenstein's work only parodied previous art, it would only possess reflective power.
  A, B, and C are related to Lichtenstein's view of abstract expressionism, which the author suggests was losing its emotional power by the time pop art appeared. Therefore, they wouldn't necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  D is not related to Lichtenstein's work and doesn't challenge the author's characterization of it.
  E contradicts the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work. If true, it would challenge the author's characterization of deliberate naivete and sweetness in Lichtenstein's work, which was intended as a response to the excess of sophistication in some other pop artists.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as a painter who merged popular culture with fine art and conveyed a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody.
  The author also emphasizes that Lichtenstein's work exudes a deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but also in some other pop artists.
  Correct answer choice would contradict or challenge these characterizations.
  Answer choice A does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer choice B does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer choice C does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer choice D is incorrect because Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it, as mentioned in the passage.
  Answer choice E does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  None of the answer choices contradict or challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation
  D: outline the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution as it was encoded using wampum
  E: give evidence of wampum's effectiveness as a means of ensuring compliance with the law of the Haudenosaune Confederacy

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:

Response 0:
Thought:
  The author of passage A thinks that a functioning stock market relies upon people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves.
  The author of passage A thinks that stock prices reflect a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value.
  The author of passage A appears to not support a law that prohibits the use of nonpublic information to make trading decisions.
  The author of passage B thinks that insider-trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence.
  The author of passage B emphasizes the importance of transparency in the stock market.
  The author of passage A does not seem to oppose all laws regulating insider-trading.
  Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A argues that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  The author thinks that insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions based on information that you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company, but trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have is not part of the very definition of a functioning stock market.
  The author of passage B believes that one of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time.
  The author of Passage B argues that insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. That unfairly compromises the market.
  Among the given choices, the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of Passage A but not that articulated by the author of Passage B is the law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
  The author of Passage A believes that trading based on knowledge that many others don't have (such as analyzing a stock, deciding that it is overvalued, and selling it) doesn't make you a criminal, while the author of Passage B disagrees with this idea.
  Furthermore, neither the author of Passage A nor the author of Passage B supports the legalization of trading based on inside information. 
  Therefore, answer B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of Passage A but not that articulated by the author of Passage B. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author of passage A argues that insider-trading laws should be reconsidered.
  The author of passage B believes that a transparent market is necessary for the stock market to function fairly.
  The author of passage A believes that it is acceptable to trade based on knowledge that is not shared by everyone, as long as that knowledge is acquired legally.
  The position articulated by the author of passage A is closest to a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author of Passage A argues that there should be a distinction between insider trading and insider nontrading.
  The author thinks that insider nontrading is okay and happens every day.
  The author thinks that to ensure accurate stock prices and a transparent market, people should be able to act on accurate information about a company's value.
  The author of Passage B argues that a transparent market is one where everyone has the same chance of making good investment decisions and that insider trading undermines investor confidence.
  The author thinks that transparency is important to ensure that people believe they can make money in the stock market and to prevent widespread financial repercussions.
  The author of Passage A would most likely support a rule that permits trading based on analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company because this distinguishes between insider trading and insider nontrading and allows for accurate stock prices while retaining transparency in the stock market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading restrictions don't allow the market to function at maximum efficiency since everyone in the market should have all available information about a company, and it helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. There's a focus on transparency.
  In passage B, the claim is made that insider trading gives some individuals an unfair advantage because they have access to information that others don't have, and this damages investor confidence in the market.
  Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated in Passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B is the one that focuses on transparency and that allows those with accurate information to act so that stock prices reflect them. The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should be relaxed since it brings relevant information to the market.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading law is important to maintain market transparency and investor confidence.
  The question asks for a law that is closest to the position in passage A but not in passage B. 
  Passage A argues that it should be permissible to make stock transactions based on information that others don't have.
  However, passage A specifies that this information should not be obtained through one's special position within a company. 
  Choice A is not accurate since it would prohibit transactions based on accurate information obtained through careful analysis.
  Choice B partly matches passage A but does not exclude transactions based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
  Choice C matches passage B and is therefore incorrect.
  Choice D is not accurate since it would still prohibit buying based on inside information even if it could reasonably be expected to lead to a more accurate assessment of the stock's value. 
  Choice E also contradicts passage A since it would legalize trading based on inside information without specifying how that information was obtained.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that people using information to the advantage of themselves or their clients is not a crime, and it helps the stock market operate more effectively.
  Passage B argues that insider trading harms the stock market, and fair investing and confidence in the market can only occur when information is available to all on an equal basis.
  The question asks which law conforms most closely to the position articulated in passage A but not passage B.
  A and C are contradicted by passage B because they prohibit some form of trading in order to assure equal information.
  D is not discussed in either passage, so it cannot be the answer.
  E is contradicted by both passages, both of which argue that insider trading undermines investor confidence and harms the stock market.
  B is consistent with passage A, which argues that trading based on knowledge acquired from analysis of a stock is not a crime, but also supports the limitation on using insider information.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading should be permitted, because it helps ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading should be prohibited, because it unfairly compromises the market and causes a loss of investor confidence.
  Passage A supports the idea that insider trading should be legal as long as the relevant information is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  Passage B supports the idea that transparency is one of the basic principles of the stock market.
  Choice A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which is also supported by passage A.
  Choice B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is similar to the position articulated in passage A.
  Choice C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is supported by passage B.
  Choice D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not supported by either passage A or passage B.
  Choice E legalizes trading based on inside information, which is not supported by passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that trading based on information that everyone doesn't have is a normal part of a functioning stock market.
  However, insider-trading law prohibits making transactions based on information obtained through one's special position within a company.
  Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position in Passage A would permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author of passage A argues that stock markets work best when information is disseminated quickly and widely.
  The author of passage A thinks that insider nontrading is a far more widespread practice and doesn't think people should be locked up for it.
  The author of passage B thinks that insider trading is unfair and compromises the market by denying others access to inside information, causing a loss of investor confidence.
  The question asks for a law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that of passage B.
  Answer choice B would permit trading based on analysis of a stock but prohibit trading based on inside information, which is in line with the author of passage A's argument.
  Answer A, C, D, and E are not in line with the author of passage A's argument.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes the discovery of a new class of infectious pathogens called prions.
  Prions are proteinaceous pathogens that are not composed of DNA or RNA.
  Prions possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous, abnormal shape.
  The abnormal prions are infectious as they are able to reproduce themselves by inducing normally shaped prions to transform themselves.
  The cascade of transformations produces a plaque that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  The body does not produce an immune response when prions are present because they occur naturally in the body as proteins.
  CJD is inevitably fatal and there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
  There is a possibility that Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may be caused by a similar process of protein malformation, but the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves are not completely understood.
  
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement by the passage is that if they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes the discovery of a new type of pathogen called prions.
  Prions are able to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way.
  The formation of prion plaques in the brain leads to the destruction of nerve cells and causes diseases such as CJD.
  Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins.
  Prions have the ability to convert normal proteins into abnormal, pathogenic prions.
  The body does not produce an immune response to prions.
  The link between prions and CJD is now supported by subsequent research.
  Prions may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but this has yet to be fully explored.
  Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is that prions cause CJD by converting normal proteins into pathogenic prions, leading to the formation of plaques that destroy nerve cells.
  The answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:

  The passage describes the discovery of a new type of infectious pathogen called prions that are composed mainly or exclusively of protein, lack nucleic acid, and reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  
  The cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves causes the formation of a plaque of thread-like structures which collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins and can convert their structure into abnormal shape, but the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. 
  
  The discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, but subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.
  
  The article mentions that Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s may involve a similar process of protein malformation but this possibility has yet to be fully explored, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.

  Based on this, the most strongly supported statement is that "If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD". Therefore, the answer is C.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the discovery and characteristics of prions, a new type of protein pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  Prions are unusual in that they lack nucleic acid and consist mainly, if not exclusively, of protein, and unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, so the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  The prion is infectious and capable of reproducing itself in an unexpected way by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  The abnormal prion conformation produces a plaque that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  Researchers believe that prions may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, but this possibility has yet to be fully explored.
  The passage does not discuss the transmission of CJD through injection, so A is incorrect.
  The passage clearly states that not all infectious diseases are caused by prions, and that viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites can also cause infection. Therefore, B is incorrect.
  The passage provides evidence to support that if abnormally shaped prions were unable to reproduce themselves, they would not cause CJD. Therefore, C is correct.
  The passage does not support the claim that Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD. Therefore, D is incorrect.
  The passage does not discuss the relative speed of progression of prion diseases compared to diseases caused by other known pathogens. Therefore, E is incorrect.

  Prions possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape, which creates a plaque that collects in the brain and destroys nerve cells.
  The passage suggests that prions are a new class of infectious pathogens and that they may cause other degenerative neurological conditions.
  The passage does not suggest that CJD can only be transmitted through the injection of abnormally shaped prions, nor that most infectious diseases previously caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  The passage suggests that abnormally shaped prions cause CJD because they are able to reproduce themselves.
  The passage suggests that the prion pathogen that causes CJD is different from that which might cause Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease.
  The passage does not suggest that prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen, and their role in causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  Prions normally exist as harmless proteins in the body but can convert into an abnormal shape, reproducing themselves and causing the destruction of nerve cells in the brain.
  The passage does not mention anything about the transmission of CJD through injection or the prevalence of other diseases caused by prions.
  The passage does mention that protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
Action: Answer("D")

  Option C is supported by the passage as it mentions that prions reproduce themselves in an unexpected way and that this causes CJD.
  Option D is not supported by the passage. It only mentions that protein malformation may be involved in other neurological conditions but does not specify that they are caused by the same prion pathogen.
  Option E is not supported by the passage. The passage only mentions that there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses, but does not compare it to other diseases caused by known pathogens.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called prion, which causes CJD.
  The pathogenic prion lacks nucleic acid but is able to reproduce and cause cell destruction.

  The passage describes prions as a new type of protein pathogen.
  Prions cause the degenerative form of dementia in humans called CJD.
  Prions are proteins that can convert their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape and infect other normally shaped prions.
  Prions exhibit a newly discovered form of self-replication that is not found in other pathogens.
  There is evidence to suggest that prion-like mechanisms may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
  The passage does not support answer choices A, B, E, and D.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes the discovery of a new type of pathogen, the prion, which causes CJD.
  Prions lack nucleic acid and reproduce by causing normally-shaped prions to convert to the abnormal shape.
  Prions occur naturally in the body, do not produce an immune response, and are inevitably fatal.
  While prions have been linked to CJD, the passage does not mention that prions are responsible for most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens.
  The passage also does not suggest that prions are transmitted only through the injection of abnormally shaped prions.
  The passage states that abnormal, pathogenic prions are able to reproduce themselves, suggesting that the answer is C.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading can actually help to make the stock market more efficient by quickly disseminating accurate information; it also notes that insider nontrading is a more widespread practice that no one would think to criminalize.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the market and undermines investor confidence, which makes it harder for companies to access the funds they need to grow.
  The authors in both passages seem to disagree on the ethical and legal ramifications of insider trading.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  The author mentions insider nontrading to show that it also happens every day and no one would be locked up for it, which suggests that the author is not in favor of regulating insider nontrading.
  Passage B argues that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market, which denies companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful and ultimately leads to widespread financial repercussions.
  The author argues that the basic principle of the stock market is transparency and that everyone should have access to the same information so that success is based on individual merit and skill.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely agree that it is not appropriate for insiders to use nonpublic information to make trades and that all information should be available to all market participants at the same time to maintain a transparent stock market and investor confidence.
  The answer is B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A advocates for a more liberal approach to insider trading, suggesting that it can help the stock market reflect all relevant information and evaluations of a company's value.
  Passage B argues that insider trading violates the basic principle of transparency that governs the stock market and unfairly compromises it.
  Both passages agree that investor confidence is important for the healthy functioning of the market.
  However, Passage A argues that insider trading should not be considered a crime while Passage B suggests that insider trading undermines investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible.
  The author of Passage A also notes that selling a stock because of inside knowledge can help spread knowledge about a company's value, making stock prices more accurate.
  On the other hand, Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence and that a transparent stock market is necessary for success based on individual merit and skill.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely agree that having access to inside information when making investment decisions gives some people an unfair advantage, which undermines investor confidence.
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading that spreads accurate knowledge should be allowed.
  Passage B states that the stock market works best when information is available to all market participants at the same time.
  Both passages discuss the importance of transparency in the stock market.
  However, Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws inhibit the functioning of a stock market. It suggests that insider trading should be allowed because it helps ensure that stock prices reflect changing circumstances. 
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that insider trading should be prohibited because it undermines investor confidence in the stock market. It believes that the market should be based on transparency, where all market participants have the same chance of making a good investment.
  The question asks what the authors would most likely agree on.
  Given these two passages, A and B, it is likely that the authors agree on the importance of transparency, which is the principle emphasized in Passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when information about a company is spread as widely as possible.
  It further contends that someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping.
  These actions help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that in a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time.
  The authors of passage B believe that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market and ultimately deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful.
  From this, the answer must be A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.

Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is being compared with a set of relationships.
  The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  The secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  The primary substance is to the growth of the plant, similarly secondary substances are to the taste and smell of the plant.
  Thus, among the given choices, B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them is the most appropriate analogy to describe the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances can be likened to the relationships between a plant's internal chemical processes and the plant's characteristic tastes and smells.
  Both the internal chemical processes and primary substances in plants are necessary for growth and proper functioning.
  However, only secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Therefore, the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances can be likened to the relationship between mechanical components such as engines and transmissions, which are necessary for automobiles to run, and features such as paint and taillights, which give a car its distinctive look.
  Choice B describes this set of relationships.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage talks about the chemical composition of plants and how these chemicals give plants their taste and smell.
  Primary substances are necessary for the growth and proper functioning of plants.
  Secondary substances are the chemicals that give plants their distinctive taste and smell.
  The secondary substances may have arose by genetic mutations and serve to attract pollinating insects or to deter insects from feeding on the plants.
  Option A is about providing a backup source of electricity to hospitals, which is not analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Option C is about the different components required for the operation of clothing factories, and does not have any relationship with primary and secondary substances in plants.
  Option D is about the braking system of trains and the various components involved, which is also not analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Option E talks about the word processing programs that run on computers, which is not a suitable analogy either.
  Option B best describes the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances. 
  Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run, similar to how primary substances are necessary for the growth and proper functioning of plants.
  Features such as paint and taillights, which can give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, are similar to how secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
Action: Answer("B")

Response 4:
Thought:
  The relationship between the primary and secondary substances in plants is being compared to a set of relationships.
  The primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The relationship that most closely matches this is likely to involve two categories of components, one of which is required for basic functioning and one of which is responsible for properties that distinguish one item from another.
  Among the options, option B fits this description.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is described as two categories of chemical substances where primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning, and secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Based on this relationship, the best analogy is one in which there are two categories of something where one category is required for the core functioning, and the other is optional and mostly serves an aesthetic or sensory function.
  Choice B is the only one that meets these requirements. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The primary and secondary substances of a plant are similar to the basic and characteristic components of other things.
  The primary substances of a plant are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants, like basic components are necessary for the structure of things.
  The secondary substances of a plant are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism and give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, like characteristic components of things that give them their distinctive look and features.
  Among the given choices, only B describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

  The secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. 
  Secondary substances have arisen by mutation and were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects.
  The analogy should describe a relationship between two categories of components, where one category is necessary for the proper functioning, and the other category is not necessary but provides distinctive characteristics or functionalities.
  The analogy should also explain that the components without direct function have arisen or have been preserved by some selection process.
  Option B describes a similar analogy where mechanical components are necessary for the automobiles' functioning, while other features such as paint and taillights are not necessary but provide distinctive look and functionalities.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances are described.
  The primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Taruskin is mentioned as one of the sociohistorical critics who deal with how art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  The analysis of this kind of art requires the elite to have a recognizable identity and consensus about their worldview.
  The taste of the aristocracy and upper middle class does not always produce lasting art; sometimes more talented artists had to find a place on the margins of the establishment.
  Some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  The sociohistorical critic must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware of this.
  The passage does not suggest that Taruskin's position commits him to any of the choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage describes Taruskin's position regarding art produced by and for political and social elites.
According to the passage, Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics deal with art produced for elites that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
However, their analysis must assume that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
The passage does not suggest that Taruskin's position commits him to thinking that the most talented artists throughout history have been those who embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways or those who subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
The passage does imply that high art that undermines the ideology of the elite can endure despite the elite's disapproval.
Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage discusses the production of art by and for political and social elites.
It notes that there were two ways this occurred, but critics like Taruskin focus on the second way.
For this kind of analysis to work, it cannot be the case that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
The passage discusses the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class and notes that it has not always produced enduring art.
The sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must claim that art that went against the grain of elite values still embodied elite ideals in hidden ways.
Therefore, the passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to choice C: if it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two different ways art was "produced by and for political and social elites".
  The first way was for an elite member to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
  The second way was to create a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  Taruskin and others prefer to deal with art produced the second way because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic or governing class and the well-to-do middle class.
  The passage does not support any of the options exactly as written.
  Option A is not supported because the passage does not suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  Option B is not supported because the passage discusses historical art and does not provide information on the most successful artists working today.
  Option C is not supported because the passage does not suggest that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  Option D is partially supported because the passage indicates that historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic or governing class and the well-to-do middle class.
  Option E is not supported because the passage does not suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
  Therefore, the best answer choice seems to be D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two ways that art was produced for the elite, either by commissioning work or by creating work that reflected one's ideals.
  Art produced for the elite by commission was done to reflect one's taste, regardless of the artistic value.
  Art produced expressing and mirroring one's ideals was analyzed by sociohistorical critics for it embodied the ideology of the elite.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always produced an enduring art.
  Some of the art that went against elite ideals endured, allowing sociohistorical critics to claim that such art embodied the elite's ideals in hidden ways.
  Taruskin is a sociohistorical critic who deals with the latter type of art.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position is that art produced by the elite that reflects and mirrors one's ideals embodies the ideology of the elite in some way, even if it appears to undermine it.
  The answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two ways that art was produced by and for political and social elites.
  The second way enables a subtle analysis of how such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  Successful art that endures may have been paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin must engage in an analog of Freudian analysis to claim that such art embodied the ideals of the elite in hidden ways.
  The passage does not suggest that Taruskin's position commits him to view A, B, D, or E.
  Only view C reflects the idea that Taruskin's position commits him to. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses Taruskin's view that high art is produced by and for political and social elites.
  The passage also discusses Taruskin's preference for analyzing art that expresses and mirrors the ideals and way of life of the elite.
  However, the passage notes that for this analysis to work, the identity of the elite must be recognizable and there must be no possibility of artists subverting the patron's ideals for their own reasons.
  The passage does not suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite.
  The passage does not suggest that the most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  The passage suggests that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite may actually support that ideology in some way.
  The passage notes that historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic or governing class and the well-to-do middle class.
  The passage suggests that the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
  The passage notes that some of the art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  However, because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two ways in which art was produced for political and social elites.
  The sociohistorical critics prefer the second way, which expresses and mirrors the elites' ideals and way of life.
  Taruskin is a sociohistorical critic who thinks that the high art is produced by and for political and social elites.
  Taruskin believes that the high art reflects the ideology of the elite class, whatever the identity of the artist.
  The passage suggests that the sociohistorical critic has to engage in an analog of Freudian analysis to claim that the art that went against the grain of elite values embodied the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:

  Taruskin and others prefer to analyze the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  The passage suggests that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin must engage in a Freudian analysis to claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, which the elite were unaware of.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Response 3:
Thought: 
  The peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
  According to the passage, dance had been neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists didn't understand dance techniques and experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Therefore, it can be inferred that the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been likely to agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  The passage doesn't suggest that most social scientists have misinterpreted dance or that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  The passage describes Dunham's approach to research as diverging from the methodology that prevailed at the time, but it doesn't suggest that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  The passage doesn't suggest that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that dance had been neglected as an area of social research before Dunham's work.
  Dunham's research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms were critical to her success.
  Colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, but she generally participated in the dances herself.
  Dunham's prolonged immersion in the dances enabled her to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices and learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others.
  The passage does not suggest that peers would have been likely to agree with A, C, D, or E.
  Social scientists not familiar with dance were not able to obtain reliable data about dance traditions, according to the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage describes how dance was previously neglected as an area of social research
  It suggests that most social scientists were not trained in dance and thus were unable to understand dance techniques.
  It mentions that Dunham's success was due to her approach to research which was different from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  It suggests that her success was due to her prolonged immersion in the dances she was observing.
  The passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that most social scientists agreed with any particular statement.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The peers in line 22 are most likely social scientists.
  The passage states that dance was neglected as an area of social research.
  Social scientists did not have expertise in dance.
  They did not believe that effective data gathering could and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  The passage does not suggest that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance have misinterpreted it.
  The passage also does not suggest that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the previous neglect of dance as an area of social research.
  The passage suggests that this neglect was due in part to the belief that dance research was not scientifically rigorous.
  Therefore, the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would most likely agree with statement B: social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage describes the challenges of studying dance as an area of social research.
  The peers in line 22 advised Dunham to detach from her observations because they believed that data gathering should be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  This advice suggests that the peers may believe that data gathering in dance is difficult.
  Therefore, the likely answer is C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the lack of interest in dance research among social scientists due to their preference for other areas of study that are considered more scientifically rigorous.
  It also notes that lack of understanding among social scientists and dance experts prevented the study of dance as a cultural practice.
  The passage suggests that effective data gathering and understanding of dance requires the researcher to have both knowledge of the techniques of dance and training in the methods of social research.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 may have recognized the lack of interest in dance research as a reflection of the view that dance was not a suitable area of study for social scientists, and that effective data gathering can only be achieved through detached observation.

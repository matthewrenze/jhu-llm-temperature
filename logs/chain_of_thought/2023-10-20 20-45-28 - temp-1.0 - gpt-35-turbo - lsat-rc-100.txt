### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B provide explanations of why people compare their income with others.
  The idea that people want to make more money than their neighbors is discussed in Passage A as the phenomenon of rivalry.
  The authors of Passage A describe "wanting to have more than others" as "an ignoble tendency."
  In contrast, the authors of Passage B suggest that "wanting to have more than others" is evidence of a desire to create value.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B are likely to use different pairs of terms to describe a person who wants to make money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A explains that people compare their income with some norm.
  In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemeenway, people were asked to choose between two options that affect their relative income and they were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved.
  Passage B explains that people generally view themselves as successful when they earn more, but the success, not the money provides the happiness.
  Therefore, both passages explain that people want to make more money than their neighbors, but for different reasons.
  The answer should reflect this difference.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A describes the Solnick and Hemenway study about how people's incomes relate to their happiness and level of satisfaction. It explains that people compare themselves to a frame of reference, and how they compare to "those most like them" is crucial for happiness.
  Passage B is a counter-argument to the idea that people's motivation for wanting more money mostly results from the urge to demonstrate superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects. Rather, earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel they are successful, that they have created value.
  Neither passage describes a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "misguided" or "primitive."
  The authors of passage A and passage B provide positive connotations, suggesting that a person's motivation for wanting to make more money than their neighbors mostly results from the desire to create value.
  Therefore, the term that would most likely be used by the authors of passages A and B to describe a person who wants to earn more money than his or her neighbors is "admirable."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that people's relative wealth is important to the level of their reported happiness.
  Passage B argues that wanting to earn more than others is a sign of wanting to create value rather than one-upmanship.
  The authors are not likely to describe someone who wants to earn more than others as "cosmopolitan" or "primitive" since neither term is related to the idea of relative wealth or prosperity.
  While the authors suggest that wanting to create value benefits society, they do not suggest that it is inherently "altruistic".
  The authors do not mention whether the person is "happy" or "miserable" in either passage.
  The authors of passage B are more likely to describe someone who wants to earn more than their neighbors as "admirable" for their desire to create value.
  Therefore, the answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:  
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the phenomenon of people comparing their income to that of others. 
  The authors of Passage A discuss how people are adjusting to a rising norm of income which leads them to always want to earn more. 
  The authors of Passage B argue that wanting to earn more is a way for people to feel successful and that they have created value. 
  The authors of neither passages are likely to use the terms "altruistic" or "egocentric". 
  They would also not use the terms "insular" or "cosmopolitan" because neither passage is discussing how much people interact with others. 
  In Passage A, people appear to be somewhat "misguided" in their belief that earning more money will bring them long-term happiness, but the author of Passage B sees this desire as "admirable" because it creates value. 
  The authors might not use the terms "happy" or "miserable" because both passages discuss how money affects a person's relative happiness without taking an absolute value judgment. 
  The most accurate answer is therefore D: misguided, admirable. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A and B discuss the relationship between income, happiness, and relative prosperity.
  Passages clarify that material wealth is used to show others that a person has created value.
  According to passage B, a person wants to make more money than his or her neighbors because he or she wants to create value and feels successful.
  This behavior is not ignoble, but admirable.
  The reasoning in Passages A and B does not provide negative descriptions of individuals who desire to make more money than their neighbors.
  Therefore, none of the pairs of terms fit the question.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B are both discussing the phenomenon of wanting to have more money than neighbors to be happy, but they are offering different viewpoints.
  Passage A discusses habituation and rivalry as major causal theses, while Passage B argues that people want to create value and feel successful from their earnings.
  It does not seem that the authors are using any of the terms in the choices to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A mentions the phenomenon of rivalry, where people want to make more money than their neighbors.
  Passage B discusses how earning more makes people feel successful and that it is the success that provides happiness.
  Neither passage uses terms like "misguided" or "primitive" to describe wanting to make more money than one's neighbor.
  The word "altruistic" has a positive connotation, and "egocentric" has a negative connotation, but it is unclear from the passages whether the authors would use those terms.
  The passages do not discuss the concepts of being "insular" or "cosmopolitan," or how those terms relate to wanting to make more money than one's neighbors.
  The passages suggest that wanting to make more money than one's neighbor is evidence of a desire to create value and can benefit society.
  Therefore, the authors of passage A and passage B would most likely describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "admirable."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A and passage B describe people who compare their income with that of their reference group.
  The authors describe wanting to make more money than one's neighbors as a desire to create value.
  The authors do not suggest a negative connotation to wanting to make more money than others.
  Therefore, they would most likely describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as admirable.
  The answer is D: admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A addresses two phenomena - habituation and rivalry - that push up the norm against which people compare their income.
  People compare their income with some norm and that norm must be rising along with actual income.
  Rivalry phenomenon is about comparing oneself with others, the reference group. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries.
  Passage B states that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value.
  People use material wealth to show not just that they are prosperous, but that they are prosperous because they create value.
  Wanting to create value is not an ignoble tendency. Instead, it is evidence of a desire to create value and it benefits society while bringing happiness.
  
  None of the given pairs of terms directly match the explanation given in both passages. However, the idea presented is more aligned with 'admirable' than 'misguided'. Therefore, the answer is D: "misguided, admirable".

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: The information in the passage most helps to answer a which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: What laboratory experiments were conducted by Molina or Rowland in their research on CFCs?
  B: What was the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1 987?

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

  C and D have opposing views, but they do not seem to be discussing the same topic as each other.
  E does not seem to be presenting an opposing view to Passage A, and the topic is not the same.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Cameras in the Courtroom: A Perversion of Justice? "The Pros and Cons of Televising Courtroom Proceedings". 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that jury nullification can be problematic because we don't know how it is used, jurors often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned decision, and juries are not elected legislators. 
  Passage B argues that the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide if a case is too trivial or the circumstances are too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. Sometimes, a jury nullifies because they do not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant or because they believe that a law is unjust. 
  From the answer choices, only B seems to have two passages that may be related.
  The titles of Passage A and Passage B differ in terms of their perspective on Jury Nullification.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the use of patent protection in biotechnology research.
  Biotechnology researchers and industries in favor of patenting believe it is necessary for commercialization.
  However, questions have been raised regarding how patenting and commercialization affect basic research by restricting access to research materials.
  The passage argues that patenting does not necessarily inhibit basic research and that it actually provides an incentive to innovate.
  The passage does not argue that the patent system is unfair or penalizes academic researchers or commercial interests.
  Therefore, A, B, and C are incorrect.
  The passage addresses the opposition of some academic researchers to biotechnology patents but ultimately concludes that their concerns are largely misguided.
  E is only partially correct; while the passage does mention the cost of litigation, the main point is not that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The passage talks about the division of chemical substances in plants i.e. primary and secondary.
Secondary substances are responsible for the taste and smell of plants.
Some secondary substances attract insects for pollination while others defend against insects and even cause unpleasant symptoms or death.
Plants have developed these secondary substances as an evolutionary advantage in competition with insects for survival.
Insects have also evolved to circumvent these defense mechanisms of plants.
Choice A states that some chemicals that are not directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants. This seems to be supported by the first paragraph. However, the paragraph does not indicate that these chemicals have a role in "various kinds of plants" but rather talks about secondary substances in general.
Choice B states that most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses. This seems to be partially supported by the passage - while it is true that insects have evolved ways of circumventing defense mechanisms, the passage does not indicate that "most plants" are still used as food by a wide variety of insects. 
Choice C states that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell. The passage contradicts this statement when it mentions that insects eventually evolve the ability to identify plants by characteristic tastes or smells.
Choice D states that many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species. The passage supports this statement when it talks about how secondary substances help plants in their competition with insects for survival.
Choice E states that some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances. This seems to be a likely inference as the passage talks about plant chemicals that are not secondary that are still toxic to insects and it also states that some toxic secondary substances have evolved in correlation with other secondary substances. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes the chemical composition of plants and the role of secondary substances in attracting pollinating insects or defending against insects.
  The passage also describes the evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects, through which plants develop defenses and insects evolve ways to circumvent those defenses.
  The passage does not provide support for inferring that secondary substances that are toxic to insects evolved independently in unrelated species of plants but survived in few species.
  The passage does not suggest that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  The passage provides support for inferring that some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants. The secondary substances, which have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, "give plants their distinctive tastes and smells." They help attract pollinating insects or defend against insects.
  The passage does not support inferring that most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Secondary substances are a multitudinous array of chemicals that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Some of these secondary substances serve as biochemical defenses against insects.
  Some of these defenses harm insects; others repel insects without doing any direct harm.
  Insects that survive the plants' defenses can identify them by their characteristic tastes or smells.
  Insects are able to evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses.
  Therefore, Choice B is an accurate prediction of what the passage provides support for.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the role of primary and secondary substances in plants.
  Secondary substances in plants give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances have arisen due to genetic mutations.
  Secondary substances can signal the presence of nectar and attract pollinating insects but others can be a defense against plant-eating insects.
  Insects have evolved ways to either detoxify, store out of the way, or avoid harmful substances.
  Insects become associated with narrowly defined groups of plants.
  None of the answer choices directly states the information presented in the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
The passage explains that secondary substances in plants have a variety of functions, including genetic mutations that became advantageous because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms, defensive substances against insects, and characteristic smells that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. There is evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects, and as a result, species of insects have tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants. 
B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses aligns with the passage's explanation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how secondary substances in plants have evolved due to natural selection.
  Some secondary substances are scents that attract pollinating insects.
  Some are biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects that lead to unpleasant symptoms or even death in insects.
  Some warn insects that they contain harmful substances.
  Insects have evolved to circumvent the defenses of these plants and identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors or by other means.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 6:
Thought:
  Secondary substances are diverse, don't play any role in plant's internal chemical processes, and give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Natural selection of secondary substances is based on attracting pollinating insects, being biochemical defenses against insects or being characteristic flavors or odors that deter insects from feeding.
  Insects evolve ways to circumvent plants' defenses that make them suitable sources of food.
  Species of insects become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
  The passage supports the inference that secondary substances that are toxic to insects may have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in a few species.
  The choice that best reflects this inference is D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning of plants.
  Secondary substances lend taste and smell to plants and act to protect them from insects.
  Certain secondary substances are favorable to natural selection because they signal the presence of nectar to attract pollinating insects.
  Some secondary substances act as chemical defenses against insect enemies and cause damage or even death to insects.
  Some plants evolved secondary substances that warn insects of harmful substances in the plant.
  The competition between plants and insects has led to the evolution of reduced plant sources.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about secondary substances that are chemicals that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, and that they have no known role in internal chemical processes of growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances in plants are important in defense systems against insects, may cause them symptoms and dies if they attempt to feed on those plants.
  Some insects have evolved ways to circumvent these defenses and can recognize these plants by characteristic flavors or odors. 
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for inferring that secondary substances are chemicals that play a vital role in the lives of various kinds of plants, especially in their defense strategies against their enemies, the majority of which are insects. 
  Answer (A) captures this idea.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
The passage talks about i) primary and secondary chemical substances, ii) evolutionary competition between plants & insects, iii) secondary substances as defenses against insects, and iv) how insects have evolved to circumvent these defenses. 
Choice (A) is not fully supported by the passage since it states "play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants", which is not mentioned, so it is incorrect.
Choice (B) is mentioned in the passage; most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses. So, this is a possible answer.
Choice (C) is incorrect since the passage talks about the importance of characteristic taste or smell in identifying plants. So, it is not supported by the passage.
Choice (D) is mentioned in the passage; although many secondary substances that are toxic to insects evolved independently in unrelated species of plants, but, have survived only in a few species. So, this is a possible answer.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The concept of increasing returns to scale emphasizes that the bigger the operation, the more efficient it will be.
  To illustrate this concept, one needs to give an example where bigger size leads to greater productivity per worker or unit.
  Only option B explains how a larger bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, enabling the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The concept of increasing returns to scale is described as a situation where bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  Therefore, the illustration that best fits this concept would be the one where the business achieves lower costs and more productivity as it grows.
  Option A is incorrect because it does not illustrate an increase in productivity as the business grows but a decrease.
  Option B is incorrect because it doesn't seem to represent any growth of the colony or increase in productivity as it grows.
  Option C is incorrect because it portrays an increase in capacity through time sharing but doesn't focus on increased productivity as the size of the school grows.
  Option D is incorrect because the advances in technology do not seem to increase returns to scale since the same number of traps is used.
  Option E is incorrect because it is an illustration of productive growth by splitting and diversification; it doesn't illustrate the efficiency gains achieved when firms grow bigger.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The Pin Factory illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  The Pin Factory's employees are able to produce far more than they could if each worked independently.
  There are increasing returns to scale— the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore, the more pins the factory can produce per worker.
  The idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  Therefore, the correct answer choice should illustrate the Pin Factory's concept of increasing returns to scale.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale -- the bigger the factory, the more specialized employees can be and the more productive they can be.
  Option A describes a decrease in the number of editors and does not relate to increasing returns to scale, so it can be eliminated.
  Option B describes a process where the bee colony is able to collect more nectar and process it more efficiently by the use of specialized bees responsible for guarding the nectar. It is unrelated to the idea of increasing returns to scale.
  Option C describes that the school district is able to increase the capacity of a single building by switching to year-round operation. Although the productivity increases, this does not achieve the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option D describes a situation where the same number of traps can catch more lobsters due to advances in technology. This implies that the industry is experiencing greater returns as it is producing more per the same resources, which is similar to the increasing returns to scale discussed in the passage.
  Option E describes ant colonies growing in number, but it does not relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale. 
  Therefore, the answer should be D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  According to the passage, the increasing returns to scale are achieved by increasing the size of the organization, leading to specialized workers and greater productivity.
  Among the given options, option B describes how a larger organization (bee colony) can divide the work and achieve increased efficiency.
  Therefore, B is the best illustration of the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that as production increases, the cost per unit decreases and output per worker increases.
  The Pin Factory that Smith described is an example of this, with more specialized workers producing more pins per worker.
  Diminishing returns to scale mean that as production increases, the cost per unit increases and output per worker decreases.
  To recognize increasing returns, there must be a bigger facility and tightly scheduled operation.
  A and C are about reducing the staff and students respectively which means there is not a bigger production process indicating decreasing returns. So, they are eliminated.
  D is about the advances in technology rather than creating a bigger facility to improve production, so this is not an example of the Pin Factory.
  B is about a bee colony using its resources more efficiently but there is no specialization or anything indicating a bigger production process, so it is eliminated.
  Only E describes a process where a large colony divides to create smaller colonies with more ants than in the larger original colony. This illustrates an increasing return to scale.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  "Increasing returns to scale" means larger companies can operate more efficiently than smaller ones, due to specialization, resource pooling, etc.
  The choice that best illustrates this concept will show how a company's resources (workers, capital, etc.) become more productive and generate more output as the size of the company increases.
  Choice A shows the opposite: a company's resources are stretched too thin, causing reduced productivity.
  Choice B is an example of division of labor but doesn't mention size increase or greater efficiency.
  Choice C shows an increase in capacity but not increased efficiency.
  Choice D mentions increase in output, but the reason for this is advances in technology, not increased scale.
  Choice E best shows the concept of increasing returns to scale by showing that the smaller colonies operate more efficiently than the larger one. When the larger colony is divided into smaller units, each unit becomes more efficient, and the end result is a larger population of ants. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The concept of increasing returns to scale is about how the larger the organization, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more products or services the organization can produce per worker.
  Only one choice describes how improving an organization's efficiency fueled the growth of the organization to an extent that was not possible before. (A) is about reducing the number of editors needed for publication which is not an example of increasing returns to scale. (B) is about how a larger bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, but does not necessarily illustrate increased productivity. (C) is about accommodating more students in a single building through year-round operation, which is not an example of increased productivity. (D) is about technology advancing, which does not illustrate economies of scale and increasing returns to scale. (E) is about splitting a colony into two, but does not necessarily illustrate an increase in productivity. 
  Therefore, E is the closest example to increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph. A large group divided into smaller groups able to produce more than they could as a one large group.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The question asks for an example of increasing returns to scale.
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as the phenomenon where larger firms tend to have lower costs than smaller firms.
  The example that best illustrates this phenomenon is one where larger size results in lower costs.
  Among the options, option B is the best example of this because a larger bee colony can better divide up the work of processing nectar, resulting in more efficient use of its resources and lower costs per bee. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Increasing returns to scale refer to how production efficiency increases as the scale of production increases.
  The example of the pin factory in the passage illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale where the workers are able to produce more pins per worker when they specialize in specific tasks.
  The answer choice that best illustrates this is the option that describes how the industry is able to produce more output with the same number of resources through the use of technology, specialization, or similar methods.
  Option D best illustrates this concept.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author discusses the writing system used in ancient Mesopotamia and how abstract symbols were used instead of pictographs.
  The sign for "sheep" is an example of an abstract symbol used. It is a circled cross rather than an image of a sheep.
  The author does not suggest that the symbol could have been replaced by any other sign or that it gets its meaning in a radically different way from the sign for "metal."
  The author does not discuss the origin of the symbol in relation to the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to
Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work
  B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work
  C: acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works
  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works
  E: explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage states that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was not limited to the tangible, and that the task of the writer was to expand the boundaries of what was considered real.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit, not on its usefulness.
  Dostoyevsky defined artistry as the writer's ability to express their thoughts in characters and images so that readers can understand their thoughts.
  Based on this, the answer is most likely D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage explains Dostoyevsky's attitude towards radical critics.
He doesn't agree with their view that art must be useful and serve a political view.
He believes a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit.

Hence, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that the radical critics maintained that art should only exist if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society, whereas Dostoevsky's realism went deeper than theirs in understanding reality. Thus, Dostoevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would likely soften if they acknowledged the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage describes how Dostoyevsky's views on literature differed from radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky believes reality is literature's crucial source but that it is more than just the tangible.
  He believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it and that the task of a writer was to explode the boundaries of the real world.
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with radical critics' requirement that art must be useful to people and society.
  The passage does not suggest anything about how Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work, acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works, or explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is.
  The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky would be most satisfied if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's view of literary criticism.
  The radical view was that literature should be useful and have sources in concrete reality.
  Dostoyevsky's view was that reality was literature's crucial source and that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Dostoyevsky believed that the writer's task was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world, and the radical critics' claim that art must serve a particular political view was the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit, and that utilitarian claims of usefulness were unsatisfactory.
  Therefore, the answer must relate to Dostoyevsky's belief in artistic merit over usefulness.
  The only choice that mentions the full significance of artistic merit is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
The passage describes Dostoyevsky's concern with literary realism and his criticism of the radical critics' view of literature. 
Dostoyevsky emphasizes that a literary work must have artistic merit and stands or falls based on the quality of its writing and not on whether it serves a political view or a useful purpose. 
The question asks what would soften his attitude toward the radical critics' view.
If the radical critics were to value artistic merit as Dostoyevsky does, then that would reduce his criticism against them.
Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage explains Dostoevsky's position on literary criticism.
  Dostoevsky believed that reality was the crucial source for literature, but he had a deep understanding of reality that went beyond the prevailing view.
  Dostoevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person experiencing it, so the demand to depict reality "as it is" was meaningless.
  Dostoevsky believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Dostoevsky believed that literary works had to stand or fall on their artistic merit, not their usefulness to society or a political view.
  Dostoevsky defined artistry as simply the ability to write well and to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader has fully understood the author's thoughts.

  The passage highlights Dostoyevsky's opposition to the radical critics' view.
  Dostoyevsky found the radical critics' requirement that art must be useful to people and society dissatisfactory.
  Dostoyevsky believed that artistry is simply the ability to write well.
  Dostoyevsky believed that fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.
  Dostoyevsky opposed the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear; Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.
  Therefore, the answer should be the one that relates to recognizing the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's opposition to the radical critic's views.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was more than just what was tangible and that the fantastic should be intertwined with reality.
  He thought that a literary work should stand or fall on its "artistic merit," rather than being useful to society.
  Therefore, if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their views would be most softened.
  So, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage talks about Dostoyevsky's disagreement with the radical critics' attitudes towards art. 
  According to Dostoyevsky, reality is more than just what we see. It is shaped by the individual who experiences it.
  Dostoyevsky also argues that art must not be confined to political ideologies.
  His primary focus is on art and its ability to convey the author's thoughts and ideas to the reader.
  Therefore, it can be concluded that Dostoyevsky would be most softened if the radical critics were to emphasize the importance of artistic merit while evaluating literary works.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The author is arguing that Toni Morrison's "Jazz" is the first instance of a novel structured around jazz music.
The author contrasts "Jazz" with other African American novels that incorporate music thematically but not structurally.
The author is making a specific argument about the way music and literature intersect in African American literature.
The claim is not about novels of nonliterary arts in general, but specifically about African American literature.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The assertion is that prior to Morrison, no writer had used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  The question asks which statement, if true, would most challenge this assertion.
  Choice A states that Morrison intentionally tries to simulate a style of jazz performance, which supports the assertion.
  Choice B mentions the blues, not jazz, so it is irrelevant to the assertion.
  Choice C is too general and applies to all art forms, not just literature and music.
  Choice D is also too general and not specific to the music form being used as a structuring principle for a novel.
  Choice E mentions the number of African American writers who have written about music but does not address the use of musical genres as structuring principles.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The author asserts that Toni Morrison is the first to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  In addition to the plot, the novel's structure also embodies the connection to music.
  The connection to an art form has been employed in literature by African American writers.
  The author contrasts the way the narrative is constructed in Jazz with the way a jazz composition is constructed.
  The musicians' improvisations are performed within the composer's frame, just like the characters' sections in Jazz are set off by quotation marks.
  The author claims that Morrison has achieved a similar effect in Jazz, that is, the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  Hence, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if the option claiming that an earlier African American novelist sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music is true, instead of Toni Morrison being the first to do so in Jazz.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author discusses Toni Morrison's reliance on jazz in the structure of her novel Jazz.
  The author suggests that Morrison has found a way to create the effect of an ensemble performing individual and unique works under a fixed and collective narration.
  The author discusses how Duke Ellington composed his works and allowed musicians' individuality while constraining them to his defined structure.
  The author implies that Morrison structured her novel similarly to Ellington's style.
  The author supports Morrison's attempt to use jazz structure as a unique and innovative work.
  None of the choices mention Morrison's use of jazz, except for A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its similarity to a type of music called jazz.
  The text mentions that Morrison is the first author to use a musical genre as a structuring principle for an entire novel and that her novel Jazz is a literary rendering of a composition style that Duke Ellington developed around the time in which the novel is set.
  The passage also discusses the way in which Jazz is narrated and how it is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 can be best called into question if it is false that no other writer before Morrison had used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  The answer is B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how Toni Morrison uses the structure of jazz as the structuring principle for the novel, Jazz. 
  The author compares the structure of the novel to the playing of a jazz hand. 
  The author believes that Morrison is similar to Duke Ellington in how she interweaves individual voices in her work while maintaining control over the narrative. 
  The question is looking for an assertion about the passage from lines 11-16. 
  Lines 11-16 indicate how Toni Morrison has found a novel way of using 'the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity'.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Morrison's use of jazz as the structuring principle for her novel.
  The use of jazz as a structuring principle allows Morrison to create a sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a collective narration.
  The author emphasizes how Morrison's writing in Jazz simulates the style of jazz.
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that Morrison uses the structuring principle of jazz to shape the form of Jazz, which is reflected in the way the story is told.
  Therefore, if the answer choice is not expressing the same idea, it is not the correct answer.
  (A) supports the author's assertion, but it is already discussed in the passage.
  (B) and (E) discuss other African American novelists, but their ideas are not directly related to Morrison's Jazz.
  (C) is an over-generalization and not supported by the passage.
  (D) is only partially true but not connected to the author's assertion.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
The author claims that no African American writer has attempted to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel before Toni Morrison did with Jazz.
The author then explains how the structure of the narrative in Jazz is similar to the playing of a jazz hand that intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances.
The author is making a comparison between the improvisation of jazz playing and Toni Morrison's narrative structure.
The question is asking what the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if one of the following were true.
Action: Answer("B") 
Based on lines 11-16, the author is making a statement about the structure of novels's form. Option A is incorrect because the author has already made that claim. Options C, D, and E make general statements about novels and literature as opposed to specific claims about the form used in Jazz. Option B gives an example of African American writers who have used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel. This contradicts the author's statement in lines 11-16. Therefore, Option B would most call into question the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author argues that Jazz is the first novel to draw upon music as the structuring principle.
  The narration of Jazz is analogous in structure to jazz music, in which individual musicians perform within the composer's frame.
  Morrison has created the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  The author discusses how Morrison has simulated the style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  Therefore, the most closely related answer to the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how it mimics the structure of jazz music.
  The author argues that none of the other African American writers preceded Toni Morrison in structuring an entire novel around a musical genre.
  Therefore, the author's assertion is not about all novels, but just about novels that are based on a musical genre structure.
  Choice A is a correct restatement of the author's assertion, but choices B,C, D, and E are either beyond the scope or contrary to the author's argument.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two sides of a debate on how to deter deliberate crimes.
  One side believes changing societal norms and institutions will reduce crime.
  The other side believes increasing fines and penalties, along with strong law enforcement, will reduce crime.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced an economic principle that reconciles the two positions.
  This principle reflects a rational economic choice: people will commit a crime if doing so has a greater expected utility than engaging in lawful activity.
  Both positions ultimately affect the expected utility of criminal acts or lawful activities.
  The passage concludes that the most effective approach to crime deterrence would involve both deterrence strategies.
  This organization is best described by answer choice A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a debate about deterrence of deliberate crimes.
  The debate involves two positions. 
  One position suggests changing societal norms and rehabilitating those convicted of deliberate crimes.
  The other position suggests increasing fines and penalties and improving law enforcement.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced an economic principle, utility maximization, which explains that both positions have the same overall effect in deterring crime.
  Therefore, the passage is primarily organized around describing the two sides of the debate and then using an economic principle to reconcile them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a debate between two sides that have different beliefs about deterring deliberate crimes.
  The scholars who believe in societal norms and institutions suggest changing individuals' beliefs and increasing their access to economic institutions.
  The scholars who believe in individual choice suggest increasing fines/penalties and better law enforcement.
  The passage introduces the economic principle of utility maximization to show that these two positions can complement each other.
  The passage then explains how both of these methods can impact the rational decision for people to commit crimes.
  Therefore, the passage describes two sides of a debate and applies an economic principle to resolve the conflict between them.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a debate between two sides about the most effective way to deter deliberate crime.
  The first side suggests changing societal norms and institutions and rehabilitating convicts, while the other side suggests increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced an economic principle, utility maximization, to reconcile the two sides and show that they complement each other.
  The principle of utility maximization shows that an individual's decision to commit a crime is a rational economic choice.
  Both sides of the debate are shown to influence the utility equation and affect an individual's expected utility for committing a crime or engaging in lawful activity.
  Therefore, the passage is best organized as describing two sides of a debate and applying an economic principle to decide between them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage presents two sides of a debate regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, versus impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion.
  The passage describes that the debate involves scholars with two different beliefs.
  One side believes that changes in societal norms and institutions will reduce the crime rate, while the other side believes that increasing the fines and penalties is the best deterrence method.
  The passage introduces the economic principle of utility maximization that reconciles the two positions.
  The passage explains how the two deterrence methods have the same effect within the framework of utility maximization.
  The economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  Therefore, the organization of the passage is that it presents two sides of a debate and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  The answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage describes a debate between legal scholars about the best way to deter deliberate crimes.
  The debate is between two sides with different beliefs and recommendations.
  A recent legal scholarship introduced an economic principle that reconciles the two positions.
  This principle uses expected utility to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  The principle shows that the two positions are complementary and not in conflict.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage starts with describing a problem currently being debated in the legal community.
  The debate is between two sides of the scholars with different opinions about the best approach to deter deliberate crimes.
  One group believes that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms, and institutions on individuals, they suggest that changing people's beliefs, increasing access to economic institutions, and rehabilitating offenders will reduce the crime rate. The other group believes that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. And they suggest increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method.
  However, some recent legal scholarship has introduced an economic principle of utility maximization that reconciles the two positions by analyzing the decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  The economic principle holds that given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility, and the expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action.
  Within this framework, the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. Both recommendations of the debate affect the utility equation. The passage concludes by demonstrating that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  
  The organization of the passage describes a problem and discusses a debate between two beliefs to solve the problem, followed by the introduction of an economic principle that reconciles both positions. The principle is used to demonstrate that both deterrence methods have the same overall effect, and the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a debate between two sides regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  Initially, opposing beliefs about crime deterrence are described.
  However, recent legal scholarship changed the debate by introducing the economic principle of utility maximization.
  This principle allows analyzing the individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  It demonstrates that increasing penalties for crimes and improving law enforcement as well as increasing economic opportunities can lower the expected utility of criminal activity and make people less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime.
  It shows that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  Therefore, the most accurate description of the passage organization is A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses a problem in legal scholarship regarding how to deter deliberate crimes.
  There are two sides of the debate: one side believes societal norms affect individuals, while the other thinks it's primarily an individual's choice.
  A recent legal scholarship has introduced an economic principle called utility maximization that suggests both positions complement each other.
  Utility maximization states that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The author argues that both the suggestions complement each other and the optimal approach is to use elements from both.
  Therefore, the organization of this passage is describing two sides of a debate and applying an economic principle to decide between them.
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  In the passage B, astronomers hypothesized the existence of an unknown planet, Neptune, based on the incorrect orbit of Uranus.
  Later, they discovered the planet in the precise location they had predicted.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is when a unknown planet was hypothesized based on an erroneous prediction but later discovered in the precise location.
  The episode that fits this criteria is option D, Bernard Brunhes discovering rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field, hypothesized that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past, and later evidence supporting this hypothesis was discovered.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The discovery of Neptune occurred due to inconsistencies in the orbit predicted by astronomers and the actual orbit observed for Uranus.
  They hypothesized that another planet's existence was causing this inconsistency.
  They predicted the position of this planet and found Neptune in that position.
  Similarly, in option C, Walter Alvarez observed a high level of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples and postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Later, evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dated to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  This indicates that option C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The discovery of Neptune corresponds to failing predictions in the orbit of Uranus.
  The predictions were based on Newton's laws and auxiliary premises.
  The failure of predictions leads to new auxiliary premises.
  The new premises help predict an observation that leads to the discovery of Neptune.
  The analogous scientific episode should involve the failure of predictions, the introduction of new premises, and correctly predicting observations.
  Option A is about galaxy tides, and it is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option B is about the discovery of a galaxy, which is not related to the prediction failures or new premises related to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option C is about the extinction of dinosaurs due to an impact, which is not remotely related to the prediction failures or new premises related to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option D discusses the past reversal of the magnetic field, which is not related to the prediction failures or new premises related to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option E is about the introduction of an undetected particle to predict the conservation of energy, which is not related to the prediction failures or new premises related to the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe. (This is incorrect as it's nothing to do with the passage's question, the correct answer is None of the Above)
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage B describes astronomers' prediction of a planet based on existing auxiliary assumptions used to calculate the orbit of another planet.
  They hypothesized the existence of this planet based on their predictions and auxiliary assumptions.
  They later discovered the planet which brought their calculations in line with their observations.
  The question asks which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to this.
  Galileo's theory of tides is not related to the discovery of a planet based on auxiliary assumptions.
  Edwin Hubble's observation of variable stars and his discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy is unrelated to this.
  Walter Alvarez's postulation about the extinction of the dinosaurs is unrelated.
  Bernard Brunhes's discovery of rocks magnetized in the opposite direction is unrelated.
  Wolfgang Pauli's postulation about a third undetected particle during neutron decay is unrelated.
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The astronomers initially predicted Uranus's orbit based on auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun, the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets, and the existence of other planets near Uranus.
  When the predicted orbit was incorrect, they hypothesized the existence of another planet that would bring their calculations into alignment with observations.
  They named this hypothetical planet "Vulcan", but it was never found.
  Scientists then discovered Neptune in the position that Vulcan was supposed to occupy.
  This demonstrates how the discovery of Neptune was the result of scientists hypothesizing the existence of a previously undiscovered planet to explain an anomaly in the orbit of Uranus.
  The episode that is most analogous to this is the discovery of Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh, who hypothesized the existence of a ninth planet to explain anomalies in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.
  The answer is not A, C, D or E.
  The answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The discovery of Neptune in Passage B was based on incorrect predictions about the orbit of Uranus. The astronomers hypothesized another planet nearby to explain the discrepancies and then later discovered Neptune in the same location. 
  None of the other options describe incorrect predictions about a celestial object's orbit that led to the discovery of another celestial object.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, or D. 
  The discovery of a third undetected particle based on Pauli's postulation in E is unrelated to the discovery of Neptune. 
  Therefore, the most analogous scientific episodes to the discovery of Neptune in passage B is not listed among the options.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The discovery of Neptune was based on observing the orbit of Uranus and realizing it did not match predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The scientists hypothesized another planet and it was later discovered.
  Choice A describes a theory that makes an incorrect prediction about the number of high tides per day, which is a simpler discovery than the discovery of Neptune.
  Choice B describes a discovery about the nature of Andromeda as a galaxy, which is a different type of scientific discovery than the discovery of Neptune.
  Choice C describes a discovery about the cause of extinction of the dinosaurs, with evidence of a large impact crater, which again is a different type of scientific discovery than the discovery of Neptune.
  Choice D describes a discovery about the reversal of the Earth's magnetic field, which is not too similar to the discovery of Neptune.
  Choice E describes the discovery of a third undetected particle during a neutron decay, which is much more narrow in scope compared to the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above as no choice is directly analogous to the discovery of Neptune.  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers observed Uranus and its orbit, made predictions based on Newton's laws plus auxiliary assumptions, and then discovered an error in their assumptions, leading them to predict and discover the planet Neptune.
  None of the other scientific episodes have a similar progression of observations, predictions based on assumptions, and discovery of an alternative explanation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage B describes an episode where astronomers hypothesized another planet to explain observed orbit irregularities.
  The planet Neptune was later discovered in the predicted location.
  Among the choices, C does not have anything to do with predicting and discovering a celestial object.
  A, B, D, and E describe scientific discoveries that do not have any similarity with the discovery of Neptune in Passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  In passage B, astronomers predicted the orbit of Neptune based on Newton's laws and other auxiliary assumptions.
  The prediction was not borne out and astronomers hypothesized the presence of another planet.
  The planet was later discovered in the precise position necessary to bring the calculations into alignment with observations.
  The question is asking which of the following scientific episodes is most similar to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option A is about a false prediction made by Galileo's theory of ocean tides.
  Option B is about Edwin Hubble's discovery that Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right.
  Option C is about Walter Alvarez's postulation about the cause of the dinosaur extinction.
  Option D is about the discovery of the reverse direction of Earth's magnetic field in the past by Bernard Brunhes.
  Option E is about Wolfgang Pauli's postulation about a third particle produced during the decay of neutron.
  The closest analogy to the discovery of Neptune is option C where, based on observations of high levels of the mineral iridium, Alvarez postulated an asteroid impact as the cause of the dinosaur extinction. Later evidence of a large impact crater was found in the Yucatan Peninsula, validating Alvarez's hypothesis.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not clear-cut.
  People may consider a risk to be voluntary or involuntary based on factors other than its actual voluntariness.
  The author believes that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors underlying judgments about voluntariness.
  The question asked which statement the author would be most likely to agree with.
  We can eliminate choice C because the article does not provide evidence to support it.
  Since the author argues against making distinctions between voluntary and involuntary risks, we can eliminate choices A and D.
  We can eliminate E because the author does not discuss the issue of natural disasters.
  That leaves B. The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not clear-cut, so it's likely that the author would agree that policy experts should not consider the voluntariness of a risk to be entirely irrelevant to decisions about regulating its safety.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
The author discusses the idea of voluntary and involuntary risks.
The author emphasizes that there is no magic distinction between the two kinds of risks.
The author argues that policy decisions should not be based on the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
A: People should not be protected against the risks incurred through dangerous activities serves no socially useful purpose, but the author does not take this position.
B: The author states that policy expert tend to focus on aggregate value of lives at stake but laypeople care about whether the risk is undertaken voluntarily. There is no clear evidence in the given passage that the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed irrelevant by policy experts.
C: The given passage does not support this statement.
D: The author argues that regulations should not be guided by the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks, precisely because drawing this distinction is difficult and often confused.
E: The passage does not support this statement.
Therefore, the correct answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The author argues that judgments about the voluntariness of risks often stem from confusion rather than being of practical use in guiding policy decisions.
  The author believes that the government should attempt to save as many lives as possible, considering limited public and private resources.
  The author makes no statement in support of an activity that endangers people and serves no socially useful purpose.
  The author does not specifically mention the probability of occurrence or probability of resulting death or injury for plane crashes.
  The idea that a risk is voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice is mentioned as being confusing and selective.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The author argues that voluntariness is not a good criterion for guiding policy decisions. 
The author advocates for regulatory policies that save as many lives as possible.
Choice A suggests that people should not be protected against the risks incurred through dangerous and useless activities like skydiving. The author did not state this, in fact, they argue that regulators should attempt to save as many lives as possible.
Choice B suggests that policy experts generally do not take into account that individuals voluntarily choose to take risks like flying when deciding on government regulations. The author did not state this, but rather, they argue that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake.
Choice C states that both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers. There is no evidence to support this in the passage.
Choice D states that public policy should deem a risk voluntarily incurred only if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. This statement seems to align with what the author believes; however, it is incomplete. The author believes that voluntariness is not a good criterion for guiding policy decisions.
Choice E suggests that the only category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster. There is no evidence to support this in the passage.
The best answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. 
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The author seems to be advocating for policy decisions that aim to save lives, regardless of whether the risk is voluntary or involuntary.
  The author also argues that judgments about whether a risk is 'voluntary' or 'involuntary' often stem from confusion and selective attention.
  The author thus seems to reject the argument that risks incurred voluntarily should not be protected against.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may not be of much value in guiding public policies.
  Instead, public policies should be guided by identifying more specific considerations that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  The author also argues that the decision on whether a risk is voluntary or involuntary is often not straightforward and may be based on selective attention and confusion.
  Therefore, public policies should focus on saving as many lives as possible given the public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Answer A, B, C, and E are not consistent with the author's argument.

  The author believes that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can subject to public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  The author would be most likely to agree with the statement that is consistent with this argument.
  Option A might not be accepted because there might be other social useful purposes for such dangerous activities.
  Option B is not supported by the passage. The author argues that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, and laypeople care about voluntariness.
  Option C is not mentioned in the passage.
  Option D is a correct statement based on the passage, but it is not expressing the opinion of the author.
  Option E is a statement that is not explained in the passage.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The author states that there is no special magic in the notions of ingoing voluntary and involuntary risk.
  Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  The author talks about the voluntary nature of a particular risk.
  It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that for public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  Therefore, the answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage discusses the difficulty in distinguishing between "voluntary" and "involuntary" risks. The author believes that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. 
Option A is discussed but not necessarily supported in the passage. The passage does not discuss whether or not skydiving should be allowed. 
Option B is not something that the author would be likely to agree with because policy experts should care if people are choosing to incur a particular risk. 
Option C is not discussed in the passage. The passage doesn't compare the probabilities of risks associated with plane crashes and those associated with other kinds of risks incurred by airline passengers. 
Option D is similar to the author's belief that policymakers should have a better understanding of the factors that influence judgments about voluntariness. This is the correct answer. 
Option E is not supported in the passage. The passage does not discuss natural disasters as a risk incurred involuntarily. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention.
  The author suggests that such judgments are of little utility in guiding policy decisions.
  The author opines that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Therefore, the author would probably agree with the statement that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?
Choices:
  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.
  B: Researchers' funding is often contingent on whether they can produce a patentable product.
  C: Researchers see no incompatibility between unfettered basic research and the granting of biotechnology patents.
  D: Researchers increasingly believe their intellectual labor is being unfairly exploited by universities that partner with for-profit corporations.
  E: Most researchers prefer a competitive model of scientific research to a communal model.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage states that the depletion of the ozone layer can result from the release of CFCs which chemically react and release chlorine, which reacts with the ozone, depleting it. The depletion results in the reduction of ozone and lessening of its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. The depletion of the ozone layer puts individuals at increased risk of skin cancer from excessive absorption of ultraviolet radiation. As such, reducing the use of CFCs could lower the incidence of skin cancer by reducing people's exposure to ultraviolet radiation. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer and how it causes damage.
  It mentions that chlorine and ozone react in a way that destroys the ozone layer and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  The depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs was recognized as a pressing environmental threat, and two Nobel Prize-winning scientists advocated for it.
  The resulting increase in ultraviolet radiation due to ozone depletion contributes to skin cancer.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs would directly lower the incidence of skin cancer.
  The best answer is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage explains how the ozone layer works and how it is depleted by CFCs.
  The passage also discusses the work of Molina and Rowland to raise awareness about the depletion of the ozone layer and the resulting international agreement to ban ozone-depleting gases.
  The passage does not provide enough information to support A, B, or E.
  D is the most reasonable choice because while the passage does not make a direct connection between regulating the use of CFCs and lowering skin cancer rates, it does explain how the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs leads to greater exposure to UV radiation, which is a known cause of skin cancer. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The article states that the presence of pollutants in the atmosphere (mainly CFCs) can chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The depletion of the ozone layer is a factor in the contributing of skin cancer, which is also mentioned in the context.
  Public policy makers developed an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases
  Answering the question: The statement most strongly supported by the information in the passage is "Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer." which is mentioned in the context that excessive exposure to UV light is associated with skin cancer and depletion of the ozone layer contributes to increasing the exposure of the human body to UV radiation. The paragraph is discussing in detail the impacts of CFCs on the depletion of the ozone layer, which led to the policy changes regarding CFCs and development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals, but the answer to this question is only mentioned briefly in one section of the context.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the relationship between CFCs, chlorine, and the depletion of the ozone layer.
  The passage also mentions that the ozone layer protects against ultraviolet radiation, which is linked to skin cancer.
  The passage doesn't say anything about little or no ozone destruction occurring naturally, so A is incorrect.
  The passage mentions skin cancer and ultraviolet radiation, but it doesn't say that skin cancers occur primarily due to excessive absorption of UV light, so B is incorrect.
  The passage indicates that CFCs release chlorine into the upper atmosphere, but it doesn't say that few compounds can do so, so C is incorrect.
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer leading to increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which increases the risk of skin cancer, so D is correct.
  The passage says that a hole in the ozone layer was discovered over Antarctica, but it doesn't say that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica, so E is incorrect.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage states that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  Molina and Rowland showed that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer allows more ultraviolet radiation to reach the earth, which can lead to an increase in skin cancer.
  There is no indication that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present. 
  Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the information in the passage is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.

  The most strongly supported statement is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage states that without pollutants, stratospheric ozone levels should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium.
  Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer by releasing chlorine in the stratosphere.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules.
  The depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  CFCs have been banned in many countries including the US, leading to the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
  The passage does not provide evidence to support statements A, B, E.
  The passage says that natural production and destruction of stratospheric ozone should be in equilibrium, so the depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs is not natural.
  The passage also mentions that the depletion of the ozone layer exposes people and the environment to more dangerous ultraviolet (UV) radiation of the sun.
  Therefore, the regulated use of CFCs can reduce the depletion of ozone layer gradually and contribute indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.

  There is no information to suggest that no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere or that few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  The passage does suggest that the ban on CFCs can indirectly contribute to lowering skin cancer incidences. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the relationship between CFCs and the ozone layer.
  CFCs, when subjected to ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere, break down into constituent elements, including chlorine.
  Chlorine reacts with ozone to destroy it and regenerate the chlorine atoms.
  This means that the increase in the concentration of chlorine, due to CFCs, is devastating to the ozone layer.
  CFCs can take several years to diffuse and break down in the atmosphere, causing the depletion of the ozone layer to continue for years or decades even if production and use of CFCs cease immediately.
  The depletion of the ozone layer would reduce its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  As there would be less screening of UV radiation, it could lead to an increased incidence of skin cancer.
  The international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases contributed to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lower the incidence of skin cancer.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

  The third paragraph begins by identifying two classes who were able to commission art, the aristocratic class, and the middle class.
  The paragraph then explains why it was difficult for talented artists to find a place in the establishment.
  Finally, the paragraph highlights that art that went against the ordinary values of the elite was sometimes commissioned unwillingly and with misgivings, but some of that art endured.
  The main function of the third paragraph is to present additional information that is relevant to the topic discussed in the second paragraph.
  It identifies two classes that historically commissioned art and explains the difficulties that artists faced trying to create art that was accepted by the establishment.
  Thus, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The third paragraph begins by contrasting the two ways that art is produced by and for elites. Then, the paragraph discusses how sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced the second way over the first. Finally, the paragraph discusses the historical social classes that were able to commission art and how their tastes have influenced the art produced. 
The paragraph does not reject a possible response to the argument made in the first paragraph, identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph or offer additional evidence for the conclusion reached in the second paragraph. 
Action: Answer("B") 
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The third paragraph starts by outlining how the wealthy classes often commissioned art.
  Then, it suggests that the taste of these elites did not always lead to enduring art.
  The author then argues that some influential art may have gone against the values of the establishment.
  If that is the case, sociohistorical critics, like Taruskin, must engage in a type of Freudian analysis.
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to provide additional evidence  for the conclusion reached in the second paragraph.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph starts with "Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way...". 
  The paragraph explains that for this analysis to work, there are certain prerequisites that must be met.
  The prerequisites that are required are explained in detail.
  Therefore, it seems like the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
  The answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The third paragraph presents an argument on the taste of aristocracy and the middle class.
  It identifies the two social classes that could commission art.
  Moreover, it supports the argument made in the second paragraph that art produced by and for political and social elites embodies the ideology of the elite.
  However, it also highlights a limitation of analyzing art produced for and by elites - the possibility that the artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph begins by clarifying how art was produced for the elites (either by engaging a well-known artist or by creating a work themselves) and how sociohistorical critics prefer the latter. 
  However, to sustain this kind of analysis, two conditions must be met--the elite should have a recognizable identity and consensus, and artists subverting the ideals of the patron should be eliminated. 
  To strengthen this argument, the paragraph further explains the two social classes that commissioned art, their tastes, and how sometimes artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment. 
  Finally, the paragraph concludes that because some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment with misgivings, the sociohistorical critics must make an analog of Freudian analysis to reveal that such art embodied the elite's ideals. 
  The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.

  The paragraph's intention is to clarify possible objections to the arguments made in the first and second paragraphs, so the correct answer should reflect this.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph starts with "Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way ...", which indicates a contrast with the situation presented in the first way presented in the previous paragraph.
  It goes on to say that for this kind of analysis to work, two conditions need to be met and mainly focuses on the taste and characteristics of the elite social classes.
  It also mentions that sometimes great artists had to operate outside the establishment because the taste of the rich and powerful wasn't always a reliable indicator of enduring art.
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph and to provide additional context for the kind of art that elites would commission. 
Action: Answer("B")

Thought:
  The third paragraph examines the social classes that are able to commission art. 
  It discusses how the taste of those social classes has not always produced enduring art.
  It explains that talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment, and some art that is against the grain of elite values has endured.
  It concludes that sociohistorical critics must engage in an analysis to claim that art embodied the ideals of the elite, which they were not aware of.
  Thus, the main function of this paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")

The paragraph discusses the difference between how art was produced for "political and social elites" with different ways. The second way is to create a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments. The paragraph further explains the reason why sociohistorical critics prefer analyzing this second type of art. This example seems to support the hypothesis that some art embodies the ideals of the elite. Therefore,
Action: Answer("A") to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.
Response 7:
Thought:
The article discusses two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." 
The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. 
The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
The example of "Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments commissioned by Pope Julius II" (lines 18-19) is used to discuss the second way of producing art. 
Therefore, the answer is A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
  C: a hypothetical situation supporting a statement reported by the author in the earlier lines
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Lines 7-11 describe the idea that some legal scholars believe defense lawyers should not judge defendants.
  Lines 28-31 describe the reason why defense lawyers who are convinced their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  The reason given is that guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation.
  This supports the idea in lines 7-11 that defense lawyers should not express personal opinions, and instead act as advocates for their clients.
  The two sets of sentences are complimentary, with one explaining why defense lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate their client's innocence if they believe they are guilty.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 are talking about the same topic as the sentences at lines 7-11. 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 follow from what's been said at lines 7-11, but they add more nuance to the discussion of what defense lawyers' obligations are. 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 are a response to the position that lawyers have no right to judge defendants and that their job is to represent the defendant before the court. 
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 to that in the sentence at lines 7-11 can be most accurately described as an expansion and qualification of a position expressed earlier in the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
- Lines 29-30 describe the lawyer's obligation to the court and society. 
- This is in addition to their obligation to defend their clients. 
- The lines 29-30 shed further light on the expectation that lawyers not present false claims. 
- The sentence at lines 7-11 argues that lawyers should provide the best defense possible, leaving it up to the court to judge the guilt or innocence of the defendant. 
- Lines 29-30 might be seen as clarifying this by adding that lawyers are subject to higher obligations to the court and society, which may limit their ability to defend their clients.
- The sentences at lines 29-30 are not an opinion opposing the earlier argument nor supporting it. 
- They supplement the point made earlier by adding more information about the complexity of the lawyer's obligation.
- The sentences at lines 29-30 do not disagree with the earlier argument.
- Therefore, the answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 state that lawyers who know that their clients are guilty should not try to demonstrate their innocence and instead try to seek leniency for their client. 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 present the idea that defense lawyers do not have to believe that their clients are innocent but rather provide the best defense they are capable of.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 agrees that a defense lawyer should provide the best defense they are capable of but adds that in cases where they know their clients are guilty, they should seek leniency instead.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information is that they agree on the general principle but differ on the particulars.
  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Lines 28-31 discuss the obligations of the defense lawyer when they know a defendant is guilty
  Lines 7-11 discuss the obligations of defense attorneys when it comes to representing a client 
  Both sets of lines refer to the obligations of defense attorneys but under different circumstances.
  Lines 28-31 appear to provide a counter to the popular argument that defense lawyers have no right to judge their clients
  Instead, they argue that a defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the society at large.
  Therefore, there is an identifiable relationship between the two sets of sentences as they both discuss the obligations of defense lawyers, albeit under different ciircumstances.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 7-11 explains that some legal scholars believe that the lawyer's obligation is to provide the best defense to their client and not to judge defendants.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 explains that lawyers who believe that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 contradict the idea put forward in the sentence at lines 7-11 that lawyers should provide the best defense to their client without expressing or acting on personal opinions.
Action: Answer("B") -> the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 states that legal scholars believe a defense lawyer's job is to represent their client best without judging them.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 express that if a defense lawyer knows their client is guilty, they should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 specifically apply the principle from the sentences at lines 7-11 in cases where the lawyer has certainty their client is guilty.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 add clarification to the principle in the sentences at lines 7-11.
  Choice B is incorrect because the author does not provide an opposing opinion.
  Choice C is incorrect because there is no hypothetical situation.
  Choice D is incorrect because there is no general agreement with the earlier position.
  Choice E is incorrect because the sentences express a specific situation, not equivalent assertions from different perspectives.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 is discussing the obligation of defense lawyers to provide the best defense they are capable of, and present facts to construct sound arguments in favor of the defendant.
  The second sentence at lines 28-31 discusses the duty of defense lawyers to not present false assertions, and to recognize that their duty is to the court and society as well as the defendant.
  The second sentence does not oppose the earlier stance that the obligation of a defense lawyer is twofold: to the defendant, and to society. This second sentence is an explanation of what the duty to society entails.
  Therefore, the relationship can be best described as agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 7-11 discusses legal scholars' view on the lawyer's sole obligation. 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 discuss the lawyer's duty when knowing the client is guilty, how the lawyer should handle the client's case, and the lawyer's obligation to the court and society.
  These sentences provide specific details on what a lawyer should do depending on their knowledge of the client's guilt or innocence. 
  Therefore, the relationship between the information in the two sentences is agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
The passage argues that defense lawyers should provide the "best defense" for their clients within the limits of their duty to the court and society. 
The author argues that lawyers who know their clients to be guilty should not actively argue against guilt but should instead present facts and arguments in the client's favor and appraise the case in their client's favor. 
Lines 28-31 state that in cases where there is uncertainty, lawyers should try to prove their clients to be innocent.
Given this, Lines 28-31 provide further clarification on the author's position on what lawyers should do when uncertain about their client's guilt or innocence.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?
  C: What kinds of messages and pieces of wisdom are most often communicated by proverbs in the English-language tradition?
  D: In what other ethnic groups besides Mexican Americans do proverbs function to maintain ties to the traditions of those groups?

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: The author of the passage refers to "self, life, and writing" (lines 12–13) most probably in order to
Choices:
  A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas
  B: define a word that had a different meaning for early Native Americans than it has for contemporary Native Americans
  C: illustrate how words can undergo a change in meaning after their introduction into the language
  D: posit a fundamental similarity in the origins of a concept in both European and Native American cultures
  E: explain how the assumptions that underlie European-style autobiography arose

Thought:
  The author discusses the assumptions and concepts that underlie the English word "autobiography"
  The author explains that the concept of self, life, and writing that underlie the English word "autobiography" did not exist in the same way in many pre-contact Native American cultures.
  Therefore, the author refers to "self, life, and writing" in order to explain how the assumptions that underlie European-style autobiography arose and the differences between European and Native American concepts of self, life, and writing. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author talks about how the idea of self was markedly inclusive in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures.
  The concept of self, life, and writing seems to be different for Native Americans than it is for Europeans.
  The author seems to discuss Native Americans' mode of communication for personal history.
  Therefore, the author most probably refers to "self, life, and writing" in order to identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
  The answer is A: identify concepts about which Europeans and Native Americans had contrasting ideas.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how the ideas of self, life, and writing had different meanings for early Native Americans and Europeans.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  According to the passage, FMRI scans show the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain; it subtracts the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
  The passage argues, however, that this method oversimplifies the brain by assuming all other brain functions are subtracted.
  The answer choice that best describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is analogous to the example in the passage.
  Answer choice A is not analogous because there is no subtraction of one element from another.
  Answer choice B is not analogous because the advertising campaign is not subtracted from the overall number of shoppers.
  Answer choice C is not analogous because the drought does not subtract water from the system.
  Answer choice D is not analogous because there is no subtractive process.
  Answer choice E is not analogous because cheetahs are inherently limited in their abilities, while the FMRI scan does not inherently exclude brain activity.
Considering the passage, the most analogous answer is A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage explains how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is used to interpret brain scans. 
FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain. 
This stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
The basis of this approach is to subtract the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to identify the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
One problem with this approach is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
To summarize, the FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting the baseline measurement from on-task measurement to identify the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted using a subtractive method.
  The baseline measurement is subtracted from an on-task measurement to reveal the portion associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, therefore giving an inaccurate impression of neat functional localization.
  The question asks which of the following is most analogous to the method of interpretation for FMRI scans.
  A, B, C, and E do not involve a subtractive method to determine something unique to a particular condition in the same way that FMRI scans do.
  Choice D may be analogous as it involves a comparison to determine the origin of peaks in Internet traffic, similar to how the on-task measurement is compared to the baseline measurement in FMRI scans.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage explains how FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to reveal the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The differential brain scans only show areas "lighting up" in response to specific cognitive tasks.
  FMRI scans are not showing the entire brain is active, it is just the end result of a subtractive process.
  The question asks for an analogy for how FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  Answer choice A shows how winning an election was only possible with a single district's votes.
  Answer choice B explains how an increase in advertisements during the summer only affected shoppers during that season.
  Answer choice C explains how water usage heavily impacts the agricultural sector during droughts.
  Answer choice D explains how most Internet traffic during peak hours originates in homes.
  Answer choice E explains how cheetahs are the fastest land animals, but only over short distances.
  None of the choices seem to be related to the interpretation of FMRI scans in the context of the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
The passage describes that the FMRI scan measures the metabolic activity of the brain when the brain is under a cognitive task deduction method by subtracting the baseline measurements, the interpretation of the rate of oxygen use is a measure of metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task. 
Option A describes that a particular district voted for the mayor by an unusually large margin, and the victory of the mayor could not be possible without that district, which is not analogous to how FMRI scans are typically interpreted.
Option B refers to a situation where a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign but had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisement affected only the summer shoppers, which is dissimilar to FMRI scans interpretation.
Option C states that more water supply is used by agricultural customers than residential customers, so the agricultural sector is affected more severely during droughts, which is not similar to how the FMRI scans are interpreted.
Option D describes that internet traffic is highest during the evening hours and most traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings, which is not analogous to FMRI scans interpretation.
Option E explains that the cheetah is the world's fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances, which is dissimilar to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Therefore, none of the given options is analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans, so I will choose the most likely option, but my answer will not be "None of these." So, the answer is E: none of these.
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The last two paragraphs discuss the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity.
  The scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use between a control condition and a cognitive task.
  The differential rate of oxygen use is taken to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The question asks for what is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans are typically interpreted.
  Answer choice A discusses the importance of a particular district in an election, but it is not directly analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Answer choice B discusses the effects of advertising on shoppers, but it is also not directly analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Answer choice C discusses the impact of droughts on water use, but it is also not directly analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Answer choice D discusses the origin of Internet traffic during peak hours, which is not related to FMRI scans.
  Answer choice E discusses the running ability of cheetahs, but it is also not directly analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  None of the answer choices seem to accurately describe an analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  FMRI produces a map of oxygen use rate in different parts of the brain.
  The map shows the differential rate of oxygen use between baseline and on-task measurements.
  The method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The FMRI method can produce striking images, but suffers from false impression of a neat localization of function.
  The question asks for the analogy with the FMRI interpretation method.
  Therefore, the answer should also deal with the interpretation of measurements or data that involves calculating a difference between two sets of measurements.
  Choice A is about a district in the city that heavily influences election results.
  Choice B is about advertising campaign having an impact only in the summer.
  Choice C is about water supply being used more for agriculture than for residential purposes.
  Choice D is about most internet traffic originating from homes rather than from office buildings in the evening.
  Choice E is about cheetahs outrunning other land animals over short rather than long distances.
  None of the choices describe a similar method of interpretation to FMRI.
  However, choice B is the most similar as it deals with interpreting differences in data, as FMRI does, to find the cause for a particular outcome.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the way FMRI scans are interpreted and notes that what is seen on the scan is actually the result of subtraction.
  The baseline measurement is taken in the control condition and a second measurement while the subject performs a cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  This results in displaying only the differences between the two measurements, not the entire brain activity.
  The question is asking which scenario is most analogous to this method of interpretation.
  Choice A, B, C, and D are all about comparing two different conditions of some process.
  But none of them describe a process of subtraction or a difference between two states.
  Choice E compares the speed of cheetah with a distinction.
  Therefore, the most analogous choice to the FMRI interpretation is A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a result of a subtraction to get the difference in brain activity during the control condition and during a cognitive task.
  The subtraction obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  There is a problem in the method used to interpret FMRI.
  To which of the following is this most analogous?
  Option A, talking about a district in the city that helped a mayor win by an unusually large margin, doesn't seem to match with the problem identified.
  Option B talks about a store that launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, implying the advertisements only affected the summer shoppers. This does not match with the problem identified either.
  Option C is about how the agricultural sector is impacted most severely when droughts occur due to the fact that more water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers. Again, this does not match with the problem identified in the passage.
  Option D, which states that most Internet traffic during peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings, is not a good match. 
  Option E is about cheetahs being the world's fastest land animal only for short distances, conveying that most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances. This option is not analogous with the issue identified.
  Therefore, none of the options seem to match with the issue in question. Since we need to select the most likely answer even if we think the answer is none of the above, we have to choose the option that most closely matches the problem. Based on this analysis, we can say that 'None of the Above' is the most likely answer. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage explains how FMRI scans measure brain activity.
  The FMRI measures the differential rate of oxygen use by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during cognitive tasks.
  What remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  The subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  This method produces striking images of the brain at work while giving a false impression of neat functional localization.
  All of the answer choices involve separating distinct components.
  Choice B involves separating the impact of advertisements on customers who only shop in the summer.
  This choice is similar to the FMRI scan because the FMRI scan involves separating the metabolic activity associated solely with cognitive tasks.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Thought:
The second paragraph highlights the opinions of critics regarding the examination and study of non-Western cultures by Western scientific methods. They argue that adopting Western scientific heritage does not provide a complete view of other cultures. It is necessary to adopt nonscientific perspectives and methods of other cultures to achieve genuine understanding. 
Option A directly talks about the differences in understanding that can arise due to value disparities between cultures, but this does not address the criticism explicitly mentioned in the passage. 
Option B is mentioned as a view of proponents in the passage and is not related to the criticism discussed in the second paragraph. 
Option C is not related to the second paragraph's criticism, which talks about different methods of understanding non-scientific cultures from Western perspectives. 
Option D is also incorrect as the criticism suggests that Western scientific methods cannot be used to understand other cultures that have different values. 
Option E connects with the criticism introduced in the second paragraph by stating that the values of liberalism cannot be understood through Western scientific methods alone. 
Therefore, the answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 1:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph states that using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures is a distorted view and can be seen as an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
The objection seems to suggest that understanding of a culture cannot be achieved without adopting the perspectives and methods of that culture.
Therefore, option E aligns with this objection as it states that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if approached solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
The critics of the second version of multicultural education argued that the Western scientific heritage is already value-laden. They have a problem with trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science. They suggest that trying to understand another culture using only the lens of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Therefore, they would most likely agree with the following statement:
"The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science."
The answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The objection raised by critics in the second paragraph is that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if we approach them using Western scientific methods.
  The objection states that these methods are already value-laden and involve a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. 
  Critics argue that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied is necessary for real understanding.
  The answer should reflect this idea.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
The objection raised in the second paragraph is that genuine understanding of a culture is impossible if it is studied solely through the methods of Western sciences.
The objection argues that to understand another culture, we should adopt the perspective and methods of that culture.
Choice E accurately represents the objection raised against the second version of multicultural education.
Hence, the answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that real understanding of other cultures cannot be achieved by examining them only from within the Western perspective. According to this objection, one needs to adopt the perspectives and methods of other cultures to understand them genuinely. 
Option A is contrary to this objection, as it implies that people can only understand their culture's values.
Option B is mentioned in the paragraph, but it is not necessarily the main point made by the objection raised about the second form of multicultural education.
Option C is not mentioned in the paragraph.
Option D is also not mentioned in the paragraph.
The paragraph argues that the second form of multicultural education adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and uses Western scientific perspectives to study other cultures, which is critiqued. Therefore, it is not about the understanding of liberalism through Western scientific methods.
Therefore, the most likely answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The objection to the second form of multicultural education suggests that studying other cultures through the Western scientific perspective involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity, which may not reveal the full picture.
  According to this objection, it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  Therefore, critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would most likely agree with B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is approached solely through the methods of Western science because non-Western cultures often have different dominant forms of thought and language.
Therefore, it is most likely that the critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would agree with E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
The objection raised by critics of the second version of multicultural education is that it is distorting to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science.
They view this attempt as an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism, and favor adopting the methods of the cultures studied in order to achieve real understanding. 
Therefore, they are likely to believe that it is important to approach other cultures through their own methods and perspectives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
The critics believe that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. They also argue that cultures cannot be understood if approached solely from within the majority culture's perspective. Thus, they would agree that the historical and social circumstances of a culture play an important role in the development of that culture's values.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage discusses how plants contain primary and secondary substances, and how secondary substances are responsible for the distinctive taste and smell of a plant. Insects have played a significant role in the development of secondary substances in plants, and these substances serve to defend against insect damage. Over time, plant and insect interactions have become more specialized. 
Choice A: Accurately conveys that secondary substances help defend against insect damage, but does not extensively discuss the evolutionary relationship between plants and insects.
Choice B: Accurately conveys the overall narrowing of plant and insect interactions, but does not address why this narrowing happened.
Choice C: This choice accurately conveys the evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects, and how the specific secondary substances present in different plants allows for different tastes and smells.
Choice D: Accurately states how secondary substances have become numerous and diverse in plants, but the piece about similarities among related species is not the main point of the passage.
Choice E: Accurately conveys how plant mutations have affected the relationship between plants and insects, but does not fully convey the overall evolutionary competition that exists between them. 

The main point of the passage is that the particular tastes and smells of plants are due to evolutionary interaction with insects, whereby secondary substances act as a defense against insect damage. So, the most accurate choice is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage explains about the chemical composition of plants, which consists of primary and secondary substances.
  Secondary substances are responsible for giving plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Insects play a significant role in shaping the secondary substances and, consequently, the taste and smell of plants.
  Plants have undergone an evolutionary process of interaction with insects, where certain secondary substances increased the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing.
  This competition between plants and insects led to the narrowing of the range of secondary substances and specialized insect-plant associations.
  Choice A is partially correct, but its scope is limited to secondary substances being defensive against insects.
  Choice B is also partially correct but doesn't address the evolutionary aspect.
  Choice C accurately expresses the primary point of the passage.
  Choice D mentions the similarity between secondary substances among closely related plant species, which is not the main point of the passage.
  Choice E also touches on the evolutionary aspect of the competition but doesn't sum up the idea of the whole passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how the taste and smell of plants are related to their chemical composition in primary and secondary substances.
  Insects play a crucial role in plants having the secondary substances they have today.
  The competition between plants and plant-eating insects has led to the evolution of secondary substances in plants to defend themselves against insects and insects to circumvent plants' defenses.
  The passage emphasizes the relationship between the characteristics of plants and insects and the evolutionary process over hundreds of millions of years.
  The best answer choice that accurately expresses the main point of the passage is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage discusses how plants have primary substances and secondary substances. Secondary substances give each plant its distinctive tastes and smells. Insects have played a major role in developing secondary substances. These substances can attract insects or be a biochemical defense against them. As plants develop defenses, insects also evolve ways to adapt and eat those plants, leading to a narrow range of food sources for insects. The main point of the passage is the relationship between plants and insects, how that has led to evolutionary changes, and how it impacts the types of secondary substances found in plants.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and how it leads to their distinctive taste and smell. Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. Primary substances are essential, while secondary substances are not required for internal chemical processes, but they give plants their distinctive flavors. Insects play a significant role in the development of secondary substances through natural selection, which either attract insects to the plant or provide biochemical defenses against plant enemies. As plants develop defenses, the range of insect food sources become narrowed down. Therefore, the passage's main point expresses the interplay between plants and insects in the evolution of secondary substances. The most appropriate answer would be (C) The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Passage B differs from passage A in that analogous displays an attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more
Choices:
  A: engaged
  B: dismissive
  C: detached
  D: ironic
  E: skeptical
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that neuroscience findings change the way we think about the law and explains the implications of these changes.
  Passage B discusses a theory of determinism called "soft determinism" which allows for free will within a deterministic world and expands upon what determines whether an action is free or constrained.
  Passage A does not provide any interpretation or opinion about other philosophical ideas whereas Passage B expresses an opinion about Ayer's theory of soft determinism and makes an analogy to the role of the brain in determining whether an action is free.
  There is no indication that Passage B is dismissive, detached, ironic or skeptical towards the theory of soft determinism and Ayer's ideas.
  Therefore, the answer is A: engaged.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that we should abandon the idea of retribution and focus on deterring future harms in the criminal justice system using neuroscience research.
  Passage B discusses the coexistence of free will and determinism and introduces the theory of "soft determinism."
  It presents a different viewpoint from Passage A, which suggests that free will exists to some extent and that it can coexist with determinism.
  Therefore, Passage B is not dismissive of the ideas discussed in it.
  Rather, it provides an alternative perspective that is different from the deterministic view presented in Passage A.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that neuroscience research undermines the concept of free will, and advocates a consequentialist approach to justice.
  Passage B discusses the compatibility of free will and determinism, and argues that actions caused by internal sources are free, even though they may be determined.
  Although Passage B disagrees with Passage A about the relationship between determinism and free will, it does not express an attitude toward Passage A's ideas.
  There is no evidence in Passage B that it is dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical about the ideas in Passage A.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that neuroscience radically changes the way we think about the law.
  Passage A suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of punishment.
  Passage B suggests that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.
  Passage B suggests that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Passage B suggests that one's own will from a disease-free brain is free.
  From these observations, it seems that Passage A and Passage B adopt different views.
  The tone used in Passage A seems to be engaging and questioning.
  The tone used in Passage B seems to be skeptical and informative.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that neuroscience research shows that humans do not have free will and the law should abandon retribution.
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that the existence of free will is compatible with determinism.
  Both passages seem to discuss ideas that fundamentally challenge long-held beliefs.
  However, while Passage A appears to be more skeptical or critical of these ideas, Passage B puts forth a counterargument and engages more with the questions raised by the concept of free will.
  Therefore, the answer is A: engaged.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage B discusses the relationship between free will and determinism differently from Passage A.
  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism.
  Passage B's tone towards the ideas it discusses is more positive and objective rather than skeptical.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  In Passage A, the author argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the criminal-justice should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing individuals. 
  In Passage B, the author argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism. 
  The question asks how Passage B differs from Passage A in terms of the attitude displayed toward the ideas that it discusses. 
  From reading the passages, there is no indication that Passage B displays an attitude toward the ideas that is more dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical than Passage A. 
  However, Passage B provides a counterargument to the viewpoint presented in Passage A, suggesting that actions can still be considered free even though they are caused by events beyond one's control. 
  Therefore, Passage B displays an attitude that is more engaged in the sense that it challenges the author's claim in Passage A. 
  The answer is A: engaged.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A tells that the neuroscientist view "radically changes" the way we think about the law and suggests abandoning the current way of thinking (retribution) and adopt a new approach.
  Passage B, instead of abandoning the current way, argues that a person can still act freely in a deterministic world and actions are free as long as they are not constrained. Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" is presented, which concludes that actions are free if they are caused by internal sources.
  The passage does not show a skeptical or ironic view, as it presents Ayer's theory and discusses the concept of free will. It briefly mentions that Ayer did not discuss the brain's role, but it does not mean that the passage opposes neuroscience.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  To answer this question, we need to understand the tone or attitude of Passage B. 
  The passage presents an alternative to determinism, which is soft determinism. 
  The passage argues that soft determinism allows for free will despite being deterministic. 
  There is a discussion of actions that come from internal sources being free, and actions that come from external sources being constrained. 
  The passage explains that the source of causation determines whether an action is free, not the existence of the cause of that action. 
  Throughout the passage, the tone seems neutral, analytical, and explanatory.
  The tone does not seem dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
The question asks for how the attitude of passage B differs from passage A.
Passage A discusses "recent findings in neuroscience" and focuses on how it changes our perspective on the law. It is critical of the idea that people are completely responsible for their actions.
Passage B discusses how determinism and free will can coexist, using Ayer's theory of "soft determinism". It does not explicitly discuss neuroscience or make any claims about the law.
Therefore, passage B is more 'detached' in its attitude than passage A.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the attitude of Matthew Arnold toward the aristocratic and middle classes can best be described as one of
Choices:
  A: respect
  B: empathy
  C: indifference
  D: disappointment
  E: scorn

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Thought:
The criticism of the second version of multicultural education mentioned in the passage is that it is essentially no different from the first because its methods are Western in origin and therefore value-laden.
We are looking for an answer that presents a strong objection to this criticism.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that genuine understanding can't be achieved because the Western scientific heritage based on certain values is still applied.
  To provide the strongest objection, we need to show that adopting another culture's perspectives and methods is possible and can lead to genuine understanding.
  Therefore, we need to find an option that supports adopting another culture's approach without distorting the culture and providing "real" understanding.
  Option A doesn't help because it claims the opposite.
  Option B is irrelevant.
  Option D is incorrect because it is talking about understanding one's own culture, not understanding another culture.
  Option E is an indirect inference of the criticism and doesn't provide any objection.
  Option C suggests using a non-Western value system for studying different cultures than their own, which will allow a genuine understanding of that culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The second version of multicultural education is criticized for using exclusively Western scientific methods for the study of non-Western cultures.
  The criticism argues that this approach is not only distorting but also an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  The objection is that to achieve real understanding, the perspectives and methods of the studied cultures should be adopted.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would have to argue that adopting non-scientific Western approaches is not necessary for obtaining genuine understanding of non-Western cultures.
  Choice B only talks about value systems and does not address the adoption of Western scientific methods.
  Choices A, C, D are also irrelevant to the approach taken in the second version of multicultural education.
  Choice E does not provide a strong objection to the criticism since it only states that genuine understanding is necessary but does not address the issue of using a Eurocentric approach to achieve that understanding.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is still a value-laden approach because it utilizes Western methods of examining cultures.
  The strongest objection to this criticism is a statement that illustrates a way in which the second version of multicultural education is not value-laden and does not involve a commitment to Western values.
  Choice A is irrelevant as it does not address the issue of value-ladenness.
  Choice B is also irrelevant as it does not address the issue of Western value-ladenness.
  Choice C does not address the objection that the second version of multicultural education is value-laden, but is instead proposing a different approach to multicultural education.
  Choice D is also irrelevant. The passage does not discuss the role of Western scientific investigations in understanding Western achievements.
  Choice E is not a statement, but rather a restatement of the importance of understanding another culture.
  
  None of the choices directly address the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. However, choice C is the most relevant to the subject and therefore is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage presents criticisms of the second version of multicultural education.
  The criticism is that the Western scientific heritage is value-laden and distorting when used to study non-Western cultures.
  The question asks for the strongest objection to this criticism.
  If non-Western cultures also adopt scientific methods to study cultures, then the criticism is weakened and the second version of multicultural education is not necessarily distorting.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The second version of multicultural education holds that the values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged, and that each culture should be taken on its own terms.
  Critics of this version argue that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in Western social sciences are value-laden.
  An objection to this criticism would be that Western social scientists can adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures they study to avoid this problem.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage mentions an objection against the second version of multicultural education that argues that the approach still adopts Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures, which are based on the values of the Western scientific heritage.
  The strongest objection to this criticism would be an argument that shows how the second version can adopt non-Western perspectives and methods in examining cultures.
  Choice C states that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, indicating that it is possible for the second version of multicultural education to adopt non-Western perspectives and methods.
  Therefore, C provides the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The second version of multicultural education is criticized for approaching other cultures from within the Western scientific perspective and heritage.
  Critics suggest that the methods used to understand other cultures should derive from the cultures themselves.
  Therefore, the answer should provide a reason to support the second version of multicultural education that derives its methods from Western scientific heritage.
  Among the choices, only C provides such a reason, suggesting that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that its methods for studying other cultures are value-laden and derived from the Western scientific heritage.
  The objection to this criticism is that it is possible to adopt the perspectives and methods of the culture studied.
  Choice A suggests that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture, which weakens the objection to the criticism rather than strengthen it.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the objection to the criticism.
  Choice C supports the objection to the criticism but it doesn't provide a stronger objection.
  Choice D pertains to understanding Western achievements and is not relevant to the discussion regarding multicultural education.
  Choice E is related but it is too general to provide a strong objection. 
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought: The passage argues that the second version of multicultural education is criticized for attempting to analyze nonscientific cultures using Western scientific methods. An objection to this criticism would argue that applying Western scientific methods is appropriate for understanding non-Western cultures.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes how Schoenberg's music pushed the boundaries of traditional music, but delved into emotional states that were previously unexplored which made his work profound and significant.
  The answer choice that is most analogous to this would involve someone who pushes the boundaries of their craft and explores new territory in order to express something profound and thought-provoking.
  Among the answer choices, only B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, does this.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The article mentions that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Therefore, we are looking for something that similarly expresses new, and perhaps uncomfortable, emotional states.
  Option B is about a comedian who shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, this is similar to Schoenberg's music in that both allow the listener to confront uncomfortable or unacknowledged emotions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  According to the passage, what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. 
  The passage also states that some of his work remains disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
  Therefore, something that could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54 is something that unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage states that some of Schoenberg's work remains disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths, while simultaneously recording recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. 
  Answer choices (A), (C), (D), and (E) do not make sense as analogues because what makes Schoenberg's work essential isn't that it is ear-splitting, shrill, or incoherent, but rather that it expresses unflinchingly emotional states while pioneering new musical concepts.
  (B) is closer to the answer because it suggests a comedian whose humor does not shy away from difficult subjects and human nature in a similar manner wherein Schoenberg's music is unflinching in its depiction of emotional states. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  The answer choice that is most analogous to this is the one that does something similar in another form of art - comedy.
  Answer choice A describes a comedian whose material relies heavily on vulgar humor, but it doesn't necessarily describe the type of comedy that precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states.
  Answer choice B describes a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore. This answer choice is most analogous to the way Schoenberg's music is disturbing (and thereby essential) because it deals with difficult truths.
  Answer choice C describes a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians. This answer choice is not analogous.
  Answer choice D describes a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy. This answer choice is not analogous.
  Answer choice E describes a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience. This answer choice seems to be concerned with the comedian's technique rather than the substance of the comedy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage argues that Schoenberg's music is essential because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Therefore, music that is most analogous to the way Schoenberg's music is disturbing is music that illuminates difficult truths.
  Choice B is a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
  Therefore, the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage explains why Schoenberg's music is disturbing because "it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before." 
  The passage does not provide evidence for any other category of disturbing things like vulgar humor, political philosophy, or being unfamiliar.
  The passage suggests that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it is innovative and emotionally powerful.
  Option B seems to be most in line with the passage’s suggestion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses Schoenberg's music as disturbing because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  The correct answer should reflect the idea of something that unflinchingly faces difficult truths and enables people to see things they would rather ignore.
  Of the options, choice B, a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, aligns best with the idea of displaying difficult truths.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how Schoenberg's music became more difficult to follow and disturbing.
  The disturbing aspect of Schoenberg's music does not come from it being "incoherent, shrill, and ear-splitting," but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
  This implies that whatever other thing is disturbing should be able to unflinchingly face difficult truths, not just be incoherent or shrill.
  The passage does not mention anything about vulgar humor, material composed of material already made famous or an unfamiliar style of humor being disturbing in a way that is analogous to Schoenberg's music.
  The passage does suggest that Schoenberg's music delineated recognizable and disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. 
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore seems to be the best match for the analogy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The question is asking for an answer choice related to what makes Schoenberg's music disturbing according to the passage.
  According to the passage, what makes Schoenberg's music essential and disturbing is its ability to precisely delineate recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education.
  According to the passage, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second type of multicultural education are identifiably Western.
  Critics of this version argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are value-laden and that trying to understand nonscientific cultures by Western science methods is chauvinistic.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the second type of multicultural education.
  The answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph discusses a second version of multicultural education that aims to examine different cultures neutrally but still uses Western methods of examination such as anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology.
  Critics argue that these methods are already value-laden and that trying to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science is distorting and not genuine understanding.
  This means proponents of the third proposal are likely to find it objectionable if a study uses Western scientific methods to investigate a non-scientific culture.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The third version of multicultural education believes that each culture should be taken on its own terms.
  However, the methods used to examine cultures in this version of education are Western.
  The Western scientific heritage values objectivity, empirical evidence, and logic.
  Some non-Western cultures do not prioritize these values.
  Critics argue that using Western scientific methods to understand nonscientific cultures is distorting and an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, using the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would be objectionable.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
The third paragraph is discussing the objection to the second proposal of multicultural education.
According to this objection, the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures involve a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version is not essentially different from the first.
The objection is about the attempted understanding of a 'nonscientific culture' by the Western science methods.
Therefore, the study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses critics who object to the second version of multicultural education.
  These critics argue that the Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are already value-laden.
  These methods are based on a scientific heritage that prioritizes objectivity, logic, and empirically verifiable data over other ways of knowing and understanding cultures.
  Critics argue that this approach to understanding cultures is not different from the first version of multiculturalism.
  The first version advocates for teaching about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture.
  The objection is to insisting on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science.
  Therefore, the most objectionable study for proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would be one that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph think that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective and argues that adopting a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures offers a solution.
  The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western, which involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that to insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.
  It means that the third version of multiculturalism would probably object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph refers to a version of multicultural education that insists on adopting the non-scientific perspective of the cultures studied.
  It is considered an objection to this version of multicultural education if Western scientific methods are used to distort the understanding of nonscientific culture.
  Choice A is not objectionable as it merely involves the study of moral codes, which can be examined through the Western scientific perspective.
  Choice B is not objectionable as it involves the study of a given culture's literature to assess that culture's preferences and values.
  Choice D is not objectionable as it involves the examination of literature using literary theories.
  Choice E is not objectionable as it involves using the Western scientific methods to criticize Western culture.
  Therefore, the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The third paragraph discusses the objections of critics regarding the second version of multicultural education. 
These critics suggest that multicultural education needs to adopt a non-Western perspective and methods to understand other cultures. 
Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture, as mentioned in choice C, would likely be objectionable to proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education.
  The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version involve Western methods such as those of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology.
  Critics argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and involve a commitment to certain values such as objectivity that may not be applicable to non-Western cultures.
  Using Western science to try and understand nonscientific cultures is distorting and an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would most likely be considered objectionable by the proponents of the second version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses an objection to the second version of multicultural education that advocates for a neutral stance on different value systems.
  Critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that the methods of social scientific examination are value-laden, and that using such methods to study other cultures involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  This means that using a scientific approach to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is distorting and is an expression of an attempt to maintain Western cultural chauvinism.
  Thus, proponents of the second version of multicultural education would most likely object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage defines CJD as a degenerative disease that is inevitably fatal.
  The passage explains that prions reproduce without nucleic acid and cannot be stopped from causing damage.
  The text does not support the idea that some patients will recover from CJD.
  The answer must be B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the discovery of prions as a new type of protein pathogen that can cause a degenerative form of dementia called CJD.
  It states that prions reproduce and cause cellular destruction by converting their structures into a dangerous, abnormal shape that initiates a chain reaction in normally shaped prions.
  It also states that because prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, they do not produce an immune response when present.
  The passage does not suggest that patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  Therefore, the author would be LEAST likely to agree with choice B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal and that the body does not produce an immune response to the prions responsible for the disease.
  Therefore, the author is unlikely to agree with an answer choice that suggests that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal. Thus, the author would disagree with any statement suggesting a cure or widespread recovery from the disease. (Choice B suggests that some patients recover from CJD.) 
  The author also argues that prions are an entirely new class of pathogens that differ from other disease-causing agents. The author also highlights that prions are infectious agents that cause disease. Thus, the author would agree that the presence of abnormally shaped prions is a sign of neurological disease. (Choice A)
  The author makes several arguments supporting the idea that prions can be infectious even though they do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction. The author would agree with statement C.
  The author also highlights that the body does not produce an immune response when prions are present. Thus, the author would agree with statement D.
  The author also points out that the mechanism by which prions reproduce themselves is not completely understood by scientists. Thus, the author would agree with statement E.
  Therefore, the author would be LEAST likely to agree with choice B, Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, and there is no cure.
  The discovery of a prion link to CJD was initially met with skepticism, but is now widely accepted.
  The passage describes that prions can cause neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's.
  The author would agree with prions being a cause of neurodegenerative diseases.
  The author would not agree with "Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease."
  Therefore, the answer is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage states clearly that CJD is fatally degenerative and that there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves. Thus, patients currently infected with CJD are unlikely to recover from the disease. 
  The passage also states clearly that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction, so this statement is true.
  The passage emphasizes that prions are a new type of pathogen, which do not produce an immune response when they are present in the body. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author would disagree that the body has no natural defense against CJD.
  The passage also emphasizes that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood. Thus, it is likely that the author would agree with the statement that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
  Therefore, the author would be LEAST likely to agree with choice B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that CJD is inevitably fatal and there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that the author would be agreeable with the idea that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  The other options are mentioned in the passage and align with the author's statements.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage describes the process by which prions reproduce and cause cellular destruction, leading to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  The passage does not mention any cure for the disease.
  The author describes CJD as inevitably fatal and outlines the mechanism of prion-mediated destruction of nerve cells.
  The author may least likely agree with a statement that contradicts the key points the author makes in the passage.
  Among the given options, Statement B contradicts the author's description of CJD and its outcome.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the fatal nature and lack of therapy for CJD caused by prions.
  It also describes the lack of an immune response to prions in the body.
  The author would likely agree with A, C, D, and E because they are accurate statements based on the information provided.
  It is mentioned in the passage that CJD is inevitably fatal, so the author would not agree with B, which implies that some patients will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage states that prions are pathogenic and are responsible for the development of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
  The passage also states that prions exist naturally in the body as proteins and are not recognized by the immune system.
  C is true as the passage states that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D is also true as the passage states that the body does not have any natural defense against CJD.
  A is true as the passage states that abnormally shaped prions cause cellular destruction in the brain.
  B is false as the passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal and there are no effective therapies for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
  E is also true as the passage states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be fully understood.
  The author is least likely to agree with B as false information is presented i.e. some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that, according to the utility maximization principle, a rational individual will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is calculated by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the probability of each outcome occurring, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  The passage also explains that this economic framework can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described response to economic incentives and disincentives would be any response that does not follow the principles outlined above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  According to the utility maximization principle, a rational person weighs the possible outcomes of a given action, and then chooses the action that maximizes their overall satisfaction.
  The question asks for the least appropriate response to incentives.
  Choices A and B both demonstrate rational responses to incentives, which are likely to be deterred by laws.
  Choice C suggests that the cost of the legal action being threatened is less than the cost of the legal requirement, leading to a rational choice to commit the crime.
  Choice D suggests that this person believes that the unprotected income from bribery is larger than her government's inadequate salary and thus risks prosecution.
  Choice E suggests an emotionally-driven response in retaliation against former supervisor.
  Therefore, the least appropriate response would be the emotionally-driven response.
  The answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:

  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities
  An individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  It implies that people would choose to commit a crime only if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. 
  The question asks for the least appropriately described option from some scenarios.
  Option A shows the waiter responding rationally to economic incentives, concealing a large part of his tip income from the government to reduce his taxes. 
  Option B shows the motorist responding rationally to economic disincentives by avoiding speeding on a certain stretch of road to avoid losing her driver's license, knowing that it is heavily patrolled. 
  Option C shows the industrialist responding rationally to economic disincentives as the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegal discharge of the pollutant.  
  Option D shows the government official taking a risk to solicit bribes rationally, as rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  But, option E explains the worker physically assaulting his former supervisor. This action will lead to several consequences like being arrested, losing his job if not already lost, being charged with physical assault, and being legally penalized. This is not a rational economic choice that a person might make under the principle of utility maximization. 
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that individuals respond rationally to economic incentives or disincentives.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of the action.
  The action that produces the greatest anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility is considered to be rational.
  The passage suggests that the least appropriate example of a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives would be an action that does not produce the greatest anticipated overall satisfaction or utility.
  Therefore, the answer is C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
First, we should understand the utility maximization principle explained in the passage; given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
Choice A describes a waiter scamming the government to reduce his taxes. Even though unethical, it is still a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Choice B describes a motorist that avoids speeding on a heavily patrolled stretch of road in order to not lose her driver's license. It is also a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Choice C describes an industrialist that illegally discharges pollution into a river because the cost of treatment exceeds the fine. It is also a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Choice D describes a government official that solicits bribes because she is underpaid. It is also a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Choice E describes a worker that assaults his former supervisor because he was dismissed unfairly. This is not related to financial incentives, and therefore seems to be the least appropriate answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage introduces the utility maximization principle, which states that a rational individual will make a choice that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The expected utility of an action is based on determining the utilities of the potential outcomes of that action, weighing each outcome according to its likelihood, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  All of the answer choices are rational individual responses to economic incentives or disincentives, except one.
  Option A is an example of a rational response because the waiter is trying to reduce his taxes and believes that the probability of being caught is very small.
  Option B is also a normal response to incentives because the motorist avoids violating the speed limit because she fears losing her driver's license.
  Option C is an example of a rational response because the industrialist decides that continuing to pollute is cheaper than cleaning up and facing the fine.
  Option D is also a plausible answer because the government official faces inflation and low wages and faces the risk of being caught.
  Option E is an impulsive act that is not a response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage is discussing the economic principle of utility maximization.
  The utility maximization principle states that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is determined by weighing the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action according to the likelihoods of each outcome's coming to pass and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described response will be the one that does not take into account the expected utility of an action and therefore does not consider the possible outcomes of that action.
  Choice E describes a response that is driven by emotion and does not take into account the expected utility of an action.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job, and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described rational response to economic incentives and disincentives should be one where a person's decision does not maximize their overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  Answer choice A describes a waiter concealing his income to reduce his taxes, which he believes is unlikely to be detected, and thereby achieve a financial gain.
  This is a typical example of a rational response to economic disincentives, as the waiter seeks to maximize his anticipated overall satisfaction.
  Answer choice B describes a motorist who avoids speeding to avoid the loss of her driver's license and thereby maximize her satisfaction from having a valid driver's license.
  Answer choice C describes an industrialist refusing to treat dumping polluting waste for a lesser penalty. This decision maximizes the industrialist's overall satisfaction as the cost of treatment exceeds the fine likely to be imposed, and therefore does not disproportionately deter the industrialist.
  Answer choice D describes a government official soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate. While it is an illegal act, the decision is a rational response to economic incentives as the salary is inadequate to support her and her family.
  Answer choice E describes a worker who physically assaults his former supervisor. This is an impulsive physical crime and not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives.
Conclusion:
  Answer choice E describes behavior that is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives as required by the utility maximization principle. Therefore, the correct answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage explains the utility maximization principle in economics.
  The principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The expected utility of an action is calculated by estimating the utilities of the possible outcomes of the action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's occurrence, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  Therefore, a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives will be an action that maximizes the expected utility.
  Any action that does not maximize the expected utility cannot be considered rational.
  Option E does not seem to be a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives, but a response to a personal, emotional situation. Therefore, E can be eliminated.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The question asks for the least appropriate response to economic incentives/disincentives.
  The principle of utility maximization suggests that people take rational decisions that maximize their utilities (anticipated overall satisfaction).
  The economic principle of utility maximization applies to rational individuals with a choice of actions.
  The principle works by weighing the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  The economic framework of crime deterrence can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, the least appropriate response to economic incentives/disincentives would not be a rational economic choice.
  A, B, C, and D present scenarios in which individuals weigh the utilities of actions and then choose accordingly, and all seem to operate under the principle of utility maximization.
  E presents a scenario of impulsive behavior - the physical assault of a former supervisor. 
  Impulsive responses to economic incentives/disincentives do not follow the principle of utility maximization.
  Therefore, E would be the least appropriate response to economic incentives/disincentives.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses different ways in which art was produced by and for the elite, and how different classes of the elite commissioned art. The sociohistorical interpretation is also discussed in the context of analyzing art of the elite. Finally, the idea of art endured even if it went against the elite's values is highlighted. 
  The passage seems to convey that there have been two ways in which members of the elite class commissioned art, and it is not necessary that the art reflected the taste of the elites. The sociohistorical critics analyze the art to explain the elite's values. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:

  The more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment.
  Art that went against the grain of elite values was sometimes paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Sociocultural critics engage in a kind of Freudian analysis to claim that even such art embodies the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is about the different ways art was produced and interpreted historically by the elite and the limitations and complexities of sociohistorical analysis of such art.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: The passage discusses the ways in which art was produced for and by the elite classes, the historical traits and values of these classes and the characteristics of the art produced by them. It also includes the challenges critics face when analyzing such art. The passage does not directly discuss the importance of reputation to patrons of the arts. Choice A is too narrow in scope, Choice B addresses only one part of the discussion, so does Choice D. Choice E is more general and broad, and accurately captures the main idea of the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage starts by exploring the concept of "high art" and how it is produced by and for political and social elites in two different ways. 
The first way is for the elite to engage a famous artist to produce something for display while the second way is to create a work that expresses and mirrors one's ideals and way of life. 
The second way of creating art is what cultural critics prefer to deal with, which is to identify how such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been appropriate to produce an art that endures. 
Moreover, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment and a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
The sociohistorical critics claimed that these art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are being revealed by works of art they overtly disapproved.
Therefore, the main point of the passage is:
The passage discusses two different ways in which members of the elite class have art produced for them and how this art embodies the ideology of the elite. In addition, the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been appropriate to produce an enduring art, and sociohistorical critics must engage in interpreting how such art embodied the ideals of the elite through a form of Freudian analysis.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
The passage talks about the historical dichotomy of producing art for political and social elites, the relevance and scope of sociohistorical critics in analyzing such art, as well as the class types who were financiers of artists.
  Therefore, the answer must capture the essence of these points.
  Choice A is too narrow and does not cover all aspects of the passage.
  Choice B is only concerned with describing the assertions of a certain group of critics. 
  Choice C is too broad as the passage does not provide evidence that this is the motivation behind all patrons of the arts. 
  Choice D is very specific and only describes the methodology of some critics who analyze art relating to elite classes.
  Choice E is accurate as it covers the dichotomy in producing art by and for political and social elites and the classes of patrons.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:

  The passage discusses the historical production of art by and for political and social elites.
  It explains the two distinct ways of producing art for the elite.
  It examines the flaws of sociohistorical interpretations of art produced by the elite.
  It discusses the challenges of analyzing this type of art.
  The main point of the passage is that the historical production of art by and for political and social elites was complex and cannot be reduced to simple sociohistorical interpretations.
  Choice B comes close, but it is too narrow. The key point is that there are two ways of producing art for the elite and that the historical context must be taken into account when interpreting such art.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The passage is comparing two different ways of how art was produced by and for political and social elites. 
The two ways are creating a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life and engaging a well-known artist to produce something for display. 
The sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with the second type of art, which is produced for expressing the ideals and way of life of elites. 
The sociohistorical critic needs to identify the identity of the elite and eliminate the possibility of the artist subverting the ideals of the patron or independently producing what contradicts the patrons' values.
Overall, the main point of the passage is about the two different ways in which art was produced by and for political and social elites and how sociohistorical critics analyze such art. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that there are two different ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  In the first way, a member of the elite engages a well-known artist to produce something for display.
  In the second way, the elite commissions or creates a work that expresses and mirrors the patron's ideals and way of life.
  The passage indicates that the second method of art production is preferred by sociohistorical critics, who see it as a reflection of the ideology of the elite class.
  The passage illustrates that the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been able to produce art that endures.
  It suggests that talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment with eccentric patrons.
  Moreover, the passage explains that the sociohistorical critic must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis to claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were not aware of those ideals revealed by the work of which they overtly disapproved.
Conclusion:
  The main point of this passage is that there have historically been two ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them, and that the sociohistorical interpretation of art produced for the elite class is that it reflects the ideology of the elite class rather than being a simple reflection of its tastes. 
  This meaning is most accurately reflected in option E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two ways in which art was produced for political and social elites.
  These two ways are not treated equally by sociohistorical critics.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
  The enduring art that conflicts with the values of the elite is analyzed by sociohistorical critics.
  They engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis in the hope of uncovering ways in which the art embodies the values of the elite, who may have been unaware of those values themselves.
  The passage argues that the complexity of these situations means that sociohistorical critics must engage in a more nuanced analysis.
  The main point of the passage is the complex relationship between elites, artists, and the production of art in history.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about the ways members of the elite had art produced for them.
  It also talks about how sociohistorical interpretations of art view art produced by and for political and social elites. 
  Historically, there were two ways that members of elite commissioned art. 
  The passage presents some of the opinions of cultural critics about the taste of the elite.
  The passage also mentions the difficulties facing sociohistorical critics in interpreting art.
  The main point of the passage is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites," and these ways impact the interpretation of art by sociohistorical critics.
  Therefore, the answer is E. "There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them."

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: The author refers. to the early days of biotechnology (line 38) primarily in order to
Choices:
  A: furnish a brief account of the evolution of academic biotechnology research
  B: establish that present competitive practices in biotechnology research are not entirely unprecedented
  C: express nostalgia for a time when biotechnology research was untainted by commercial motives
  D: argue that biotechnology research is considerably more sophisticated today than it was in the past
  E: provide a historical justification for opposition to biotechnology patents
Response 0:
Thought:
The paragraph talks about measures taken by early biotechnology researchers to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created.
The author specifically mentions that "the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model."
The author is arguing that the perception of biotechnology patents hindering basic research because of restrictions on access to research materials is incorrect.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)
  B: "highly diverse" (line 10)

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author suggests that increasing returns create a natural tendency towards monopoly.
  The author claims that the invisible hand works properly when there is competition in the market, and nobody can exert monopoly power.
  If there is a way to achieve increasing returns without leading to monopoly power, then the author's argument is undermined.
  Answer Choice C describes businesses colluding to set prices, which is still a form of monopoly power.
  Answer Choice A describes businesses that are geographically separated, so one region's monopoly power does not affect other regions' competition.
  Answer Choice B and E are irrelevant to the argument.
  Answer Choice D describes that the size to achieve returns to scale varies, which does not undermine the author's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns lead to a natural monopoly.
  Monopoly power is the opposite of what is needed for the invisible hand to work properly.
  Therefore, the connection between increasing returns and monopoly undermines the notion of the invisible hand.
  The author claims that increasing returns are resisted in economic thought due to the difficulty in representing the idea mathematically.
  To undermine this connection, we need to show that there is no necessary link between increasing returns and monopoly power. 
  Option A doesn't undermine the argument because it refers to regional monopolies, not monopolies due to increasing returns. 
  Option B does not undermine the argument because the lower salary of workers doesn't imply anything about monopoly power. 
  Option C reinforces the argument that monopoly power leads to higher prices and therefore undermines the idea that free markets can regulate prices effectively.
  Option D, if true, implies that not all businesses grow to monopolize their industry.
  Option E shows that there can be diminishing returns to specialization that prevent increasing returns from leading to monopoly.
  Thus, Option E would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The author mentioned that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency towards monopoly. 
  If an option states a condition in which a business can achieve increasing returns but it cannot reach a monopoly, that would undermine the link that the author draws between the two.
  Option A describes that larger businesses exist in the same industry in different regions but a business is able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region. But if there exists a larger business, then it wouldn't be a monopoly. Hence, it does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option B states that as tasks become narrower, workers aren't able to command high salaries as they were before. This is unrelated to the relationship between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option C states that when an industry is dominated by a few players, these businesses often collude to set prices like a true monopoly. This does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option D states that the size a business must reach to achieve economies of scale differs by industry. This is unrelated to the relationship between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option E states that there may be offsetting factors for any productivity gains achieved when workers become more specialized. This is unrelated to the relationship between increased size and monopoly power.
  None of the options undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The question asks which of the choices will undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  The author has explained that the connection exists because larger firms with increasing returns can achieve lower costs than smaller firms, thus driving smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players.
  Therefore, if there is a case that contradicts this idea, the connection between size and monopoly power is weakened.
  Among the choices, C is attractive as it describes collusion between big firms that dominate an industry to set prices high.
  However, collusion is a reflection of the dominant power of the big firms, not a case that contradicts the idea of the connection.
  D is also attractive as it states that the size that a business must reach in order to achieve increasing returns vary widely from industry to industry.
  This fact would suggest that it is not always true that larger firms can drive smaller firms out of business, and hence the connection between size and monopoly power is weakened.
  Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The author argues that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business.
  This is because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business, favoring bigger firms.
  However, for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, not just a few players.
  Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  If the size of a business needed to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry (D), then it would be difficult to draw a direct connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The question asks which answer would MOST undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  The paragraph explains that increasing returns tend to create a natural tendency toward monopoly, while the invisible hand requires many competitors in each industry.
  Answer choice A addresses only regional monopoly power, not the relationship between returns to scale and monopoly power.
  Answer choice B discusses worker salaries and does not address the relationship between returns to scale and monopoly power.
  Answer choice C acknowledges that businesses may collude to set prices but does not address the relationship between returns to scale and monopoly power.
  Answer choice D states that the size that businesses must reach to begin achieving increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it means that not all industries are suited to large businesses that have a monopolistic advantage. Therefore, larger size in some cases will not lead to increased monopoly power.
  Answer choice E discusses other factors that may offset increased productivity from specialization. Although this might impact the effectiveness of the pin factory, it does not address the relationship between returns to scale and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author argues that if returns to scale are increasing, then bigger firms tend to dominate smaller firms.
  The author also argues that for the invisible hand of the market to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that no one can exert monopoly power.
  Therefore, the author is making a connection between increasing returns to scale and the tendency toward monopoly, and conversely, between diminishing returns and many competitors.
  If one of the answer choices provides an alternate explanation for monopoly power in spite of increasing returns to scale, then that would undermine the author's argument.
  None of the answer choices appear to do so.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns can lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly because larger firms can achieve lower costs than smaller firms. The author suggests that the assumption of diminishing returns allows for free markets to work properly with many competitors in each industry. Therefore, to undermine this connection, we need a statement that shows that increasing returns do not necessarily lead to monopolies or that diminishing returns does not necessarily prevent monopolies.
  
A: This answers implies that even though larger businesses exist, they do not necessarily have the necessary power to drive out smaller player. This may support the idea that increasing returns do not always lead to monopolies. 
B: Although the information in this answer may be useful, it does not undermine the author's argument about monopoly power.
C: The answer supports the author's argument of the link between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
D: This answer only provides additional information about the assumption of increasing returns.
E: This answer does not address the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power.

Therefore, the answer is A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The article discusses a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand
  The Pin Factory demonstrated that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, creating a natural tendency towards monopoly, in part because larger firms tend to have larger economies of scale
  Increasing returns, which are strongly tied to the size of an industry, support the idea that firms have increasing rather than diminishing economies of scale
  The connection between increasing returns and monopoly power suggests that a business with the potential for increased returns on a large scale would naturally drive smaller rivals out of business, resulting in a monopoly.
  Choice A does not undermine the connection between increase returns, size, and monopoly. 
  Choice B does not challenge the notion that increasing returns are tied to the size of the firm
  Choice C reinforces the idea of monopolistic tendencies in businesses dominated by a few players, which would support the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power.
  However, choice D raises doubt because if the size at which a firm begins to produce economies of scale varies widely from industry to industry, then the connection between size and monopoly power might not be as straightforward as the article suggests.
  Choice E does not challenge the connection between increasing returns and size.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author's argument is that there is a contradiction between the idea of increasing efficiency through size and the need for many competitors so that there is no exertion of monopoly power.
  The idea of increasing returns is the concept of size affecting efficiency gains positively.
  If there are cases where large businesses can't exercise market power, then the argument fails.
  Therefore, the answer is A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society
  E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The radical critics believed that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and literature should be useful.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but reality was more than just the tangible. There was no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  The radical critics' demand that reality should be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for him, since reality was shaped by the person who experienced it. What may not be reality for you may be reality for me.
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. 
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' requirement that art must be "useful" to people and society as how can we know what will show itself to be useful.
  Therefore, the answer is D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage states that Dostoyevsky took a middle ground between two opposing directions of Russian literary criticism.
Dostoyevsky thought that reality is literature's crucial source and that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
Dostoyevsky believed that for a writer, the task was to explode the boundaries of the so-called, real-world because reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit, and artistry is the ability to write well.
The utilitarian claim that formal aspects of a work were secondary and it's the goal was good and purpose clear was a contradiction in terms, he said.
Dostoyevsky thought that the radical critic's requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society was unsatisfactory since one cannot predict whether a work will show itself to be useful.
Hence, Dostoevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed that reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's view of reality is different from radical critics'.
  For Dostoyevsky, there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The radical critics view on reality is meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  He believed that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms.
  Therefore, the answer is D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's philosophical view on literature and art.
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view regarding realism which maintains that art should be grounded in the representation of concrete reality in order to contribute to the creation of a new society. According to the passage, for Dostoyevsky, limiting art to the confines of concrete reality was meaningless. Thus, it must mean that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' definition of realism as a literary style that should be used to create a new and just society.
  The passage implies that for Dostoyevsky, reality was fluid and was constructed based on individual experiences.
  Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky took a specific position in the debate on Russian literary criticism.
  Dostoyevsky's view of reality is not the same as the shared view among radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky thinks that reality is shaped by the individual experiencing it.
  He does not agree with radical critics' view that art is only useful if it contributes to new society or political views.
  He believes art must stand on its own "artistic merit."
  Based on these thoughts, the answer must be one of the two options that talk about Dostoyevsky's view on "realism."
  Option C states that art should be elevated above reality, which is not the case based on the passage.
  Option E states that reality is not the crucial source of successful literature, which is contradicts the mentioned idea that reality is the critical source.
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky's view of reality is what sets him apart from the radical critics, and he does not go against realism as a whole.
  The answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage states that Dostoevsky took a different position than radical critics who believed that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but he understood the reality deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  According to Dostoevsky, there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  Dostoevsky never believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The radical critics insisted that art must serve a particular political view, and they required that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society, they seemed to Dostoevsky unsatisfactory.
  Therefore, from the given choices, the answer to the question is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: The passage stat es that the writing on clay tablets found in Uruk
Choices:
  A: was not deciphered by archaeologists until 1992

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A talks about Popper's philosophy of science, which includes theories that are testable by experiment.
  Passage B discusses attempts to predict an orbit based on theories.
  It also talks about auxiliary assumptions that are often used to derive predictions from scientific theories.
  These assumptions may need to be revised when a prediction is not borne out by evidence.
  Passage B, therefore, exemplifies how scientists revise a theory based on new evidence through the process of predicting a planet's orbit.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A mentions Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science.
  One of his main ideas is that scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them.
  Passage B mentions attempts by astronomers to predict the orbits of Uranus and Mercury.
  In each instance, the predictions were incorrect, and the astronomers had to revise their assumptions.
  In light of these considerations, the answer should be B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses Popper's philosophy of science.
  Passage B describes two instances where astronomers predict the orbit of a planet.
  In both instances, the predictions were not borne out, and the auxiliary assumptions had to be changed.
  This resulted in revising the theory and hypothesizing the existence of another planet.
  Therefore, the answer is B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A talks about Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science, particularly about negative evidence being important.
  Passage B talks about how observations of a planet's orbit affected astronomers' predictions of the orbit and ultimately led to a change in auxiliary assumptions.
  It shows the astronomers revising their theory based on the observations and changing assumptions.
  Therefore, the answer is B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the difference between positive and negative evidence.
  Popper believes scientific research involves searching for negative evidence.
  The example in Passage B shows how astronomy theories are developed and revised.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions to explain Uranus's orbit and predicted Neptune.
  They hypothesized another planet to explain Mercury's orbit but then later revised their theory using Einstein's.
  The astronomers' story in Passage B illustrates a scientific theory being revised based on new evidence or assumptions.
  The answer is B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A describes Popper's views on scientific research, while Passage B illustrates how astronomers discovered Neptune.
  In Passage A, generating bold theories and searching for confirmatory and, more importantly, negative evidence is a part of scientific research.
  In Passage B, astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The prediction turned out to be incorrect, leading the astronomers to revise their auxiliary assumption about the existence of other planets, and later they discovered Neptune.
  The astronomers also made predictions about the orbit of Mercury, which were also incorrect, and scientists hypothesized the existence of another planet (Vulcan) to explain the deviation.
  Finally, Einstein's general theory of relativity made successful predictions about the orbit of Mercury.
  Therefore, revising a theory to explain the deviation from the prediction made using auxiliary assumptions is the most appropriate answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A presents Karl Popper's contribution to philosophy of science.
  Passage B illustrates the process of how scientists predict the orbit of planets, revise their predictions, and hypothesize the existence of other planets to explain discrepancies between their predictions and observations.
  The question asks to find a process that is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B.
  Popper's use of negative evidence involves the process of revising a theory that has been disproved by negative evidence.
  Passage B illustrates the process of revising predictions based on a theory after receiving negative evidence in the form of inconsistent observations.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A talks about Karl Popper's philosophy of science, which includes the search for negative evidence in order to disprove theories. It also mentions that scientific theories must make testable predictions to be considered scientific. 
  Passage B describes the efforts of astronomers to predict the orbits of planets based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, and how their predictions did not always match their observations. However, by revising their assumptions and hypotheses, they were able to make more accurate predictions of planetary orbits. 
  It can be inferred that revising a theory is mentioned in Passage A and illustrated in Passage B. Therefore, the answer is B: revising a theory. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
    Passage A talks about Popper's view on the philosophy of science and the search for negative evidence in scientific research.
    Passage B discusses how scientists predicted the orbit of Uranus and Mercury by using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions only to find out that their predictions were incorrect, and how they had to revise their assumptions and search for other planets.
    The passage B clearly illustrates the process of revising a scientific theory using auxiliary assumptions when the theory's predictions do not agree with experimental results.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
Passage A mentions Popper's view that a theory only counts as scientific if it makes predictions that are testable. 
Passage B concerns theories that are tested by predicting a planet's orbit as in the case of Neptune. 
The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets when they observed that the orbit of Uranus was incorrect. 
Thus, the astronomers revised their theory when they hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they later discovered to be Neptune. 
Therefore, the answer is B: revising a theory.

Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

Thought:
  The passage discusses the degree to which the views of Mexican American Generation were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period.
  Garcia argues that a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared between 1930 and 1960 that were more acculturated and hence more politically active than their predecessor.
  However, the passage notes that it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists.
  The passage does not support that Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  The passage does not support that Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  The passage does not mention anything about the variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large.
  The passage seems to suggest that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness, as noted by the increase in proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States by 1930.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The passage discusses the increase of the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States during the period and Garcia argues that a more acculturated Mexican American population appeared, which was politically active than its predecessor in the period. However, without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of the Mexican Americans born in the United States results in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism. 
So, the passage suggests that the relationship between ethnic consciousness and nativity of Mexican Americans is not straightforward and requires a better understanding of the effect of variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
- The passage discusses the degree to which the views of activists of the Mexican American Generation were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States.
- The passage notes that one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
- The passage does not explicitly state that ethnic consciousness increases or decreases based on any of the factors listed in the answer choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage states that Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of the activists during 1930 and 1960 were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the U.S.
  The increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States did not necessarily result in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  The passage does not support A, C, and D.
  The passage supports the idea that ethnic consciousness might vary based on the variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage addresses the question of how representative the views of activists were of the broader Mexican American population during the 1930s and 1960s.
  The author suggests that it is not possible to draw conclusions about the Mexican American population's political activism based solely on the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States.
  The passage does not address explicitly whether ethnic consciousness increases or decreases under different circumstances.
  However, the author suggests that variables such as rates of immigration and naturalization could affect ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, the most accurate answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that Garcia argues that a new generation of Mexican American leaders were more acculturated and consequently more politically active than its predecessor, and these leaders were influenced by inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans.
  The passage also implies, to understand the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create.
  
Action: Answer("E") 
The best answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness, as this is directly mentioned in the passage as important variables in understanding ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the factors that can influence ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
  The passage notes that the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States increased from 1930 to 1960.
  The passage suggests that this new generation of Mexican Americans were more politically active.
  However, the passage also notes that it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists.
  Moreover, the passage explains that the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create must be considered.
  Therefore, the answer is not conclusive based on the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans during the 1930s to 1960s.
  The passage notes that Garcia claims a new generation of Mexican American leaders were more politically active than their predecessors, and were influenced by wartime rhetoric to achieve civil rights.
  However, the passage casts doubt on the representativeness of these leaders and their views for the entire ethnic Mexican population, given the changing patterns of immigration and naturalization.
  The passage suggests that a better understanding of these variables is necessary to understanding the extent and variation in ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
  The passage does not support the claim that an increase in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization alone leads to an increase in ethnic consciousness.
  The passage also does not support the claim that an increase in Mexican Americans born in the United States alone leads to an increase in ethnic consciousness or a decrease in ethnic consciousness as they assimilate.
  Instead, the passage suggests that these variables interact with other factors to contribute to variations in ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
  Based on this, the best answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage discusses how Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent.
Garcia's thesis that Mexican American activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s.
Garcia notes that a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor.
The passage also states that without a better understanding of important variables, one cannot assume that the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States resulted in an increase in ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Therefore, the passage supports that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage acknowledges the increasing number of Mexican Americans born in the US.
  Mario Garcia argues that this generation was more acculturated and more politically active than its predecessor.
  However, the passage also notes that the degree to which the views of these activists represent the Mexican American population as a whole is unclear.
  It is not clear if the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the US necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  Therefore, the passage does not explicitly support options A, C, D or E.
  The passage suggests option B as a possibility but does not explicitly support or deny it.
  Overall, the passage does not provide a clear statement about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The colleagues advised Dunham not to get too involved in the dances she was observing.
  They believed that effective data gathering could only be done from a position of complete detachment.
  The author describes the view as unrealistic.
  Therefore, the author would most likely disagree with the colleagues’ advice in regard to complete detachment.
  The answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The colleagues were advising Dunham not to be too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  They believed that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  The author implies that Dunham's approach of participating in the dances herself was more effective.
  Therefore, the author might most likely agree with the statement that the colleagues were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment.
  The answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The colleagues recommended that Dunham not become too involved in the dances she was observing.
  The colleagues believed that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Dunham, on the other hand, participated in the dances herself to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
  The passage does not indicate that the colleagues' approach was effective.
  The passage does suggest that Dunham's immersion approach was effective.
  Therefore, the author might agree with the statement that the colleagues were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The colleagues in anthropology were advising Dunham about her participation in the research of traditional Caribbean dance forms.
  They had concerns about the extreme physical demands of the dances and subscribed to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Dunham, because of her interest and her skill as a performer, generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself.
  The passage is not indicating the colleagues’ thoughts on injury during fieldwork, the skillfulness in performing those dances, scientific rigor of detachment, or the study of dance with scientific rigor.
  Answer C is the opposite of what the passage states.
  The correct answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that the colleagues advised Dunham not to participate in the dances out of concern for her well-being and to maintain objectivity during data collection.
  However, Dunham's success in incorporating traditional dance techniques into modern North American dance is attributed to her ability to immerse herself in the dances and learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others.
  The author challenges the view that effective research must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to get too involved with the dances she was observing.
  They were concerned about the physical demands of the dances and wanted her to maintain detachment during data gathering.
  The author refers to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  The author reports Dunham's approach diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at that time.
  The author does not mention whether Dunham's participation hindered her research or compromised rigor.
  None of the answer choices suggest that Dunham's colleagues were partly correct.
  Answer choices A and B are not supported by the passage.
  Answer choices D and E do not specifically address the concerns of Dunham's colleagues about detachment.
  Answer choice C accurately reflects the author's opinion based on the content of the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing. The reason was twofold: 1) the extreme physical demands of the dances, and 2) the view that effective data gathering must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. The passage suggests that Dunham eschewed this caution because of her interest and skill as a performer.
  The author does not suggest that injury sustained during fieldwork compromised Dunham's research.
  The author does not suggest that the colleagues changed their advice about the degree of Dunham's involvement in the dances.
  The author does not suggest that extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  The author does not suggest that dance cannot be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.
  The statement that the author is most likely to agree with is that the colleagues were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The passage mentions that Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
This was because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
However, Dunham's approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time, was deemed successful and critical to her success.
It follows that the author would most likely disagree with the colleagues' recommendation to increase detachment in fieldwork.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the advice given by colleagues in anthropology to Katherine Dunham.
  The colleagues advised caution and detachment during data gathering.
  The author of the passage expresses disagreement with the colleague's advice.
  The author suggests that Dunham's success is due to her immersion in the dances she was studying.
  Therefore, the author is most likely to agree with the statement that the colleagues were incorrect to advise Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  The answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  The colleagues believed that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  The passage doesn't suggest that the colleagues recommended that Dunham change her methods of data collection because of the possibility of injury during fieldwork.
  Although Dunham's skill in performing Caribbean dances improved with experience, the colleagues didn't advise her to exercise caution in participating in these dances because of this reason.
  Dunham's prolonged immersion in dance practices enabled her to comprehend them as complex cultural practices.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to disagree with the colleagues for underestimating the advantages of extensive personal investment in fieldwork.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:
Thought:
The phrase "whole categories of expense" is followed by examples of costs that are eliminated under digital publishing.
These examples include: storing inventory, shipping books, displaying books in stores, and returning unsold books to publishers.
Thus, the phrase "whole categories of expense" is used to refer to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Therefore, the answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Based on the context, the author seems to refer to the expenses that are irreverent when it comes to digital publication.

Thought: 
  The author states that the digital publication of a book online involves no physical inventory, thereby eliminating certain costs.
  In the following sentence, the author states that this eliminates "whole categories of expense."
  Therefore, the phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to costs that are specific to traditional publishing and which are eliminated through digital publication.
  Choice B refers to the cost of printing and binding, which is a category within traditional publishing that is eliminated through digital publishing.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author mentions the "categories of expense" that would be eliminated with digital publishing.
  These include warehousing, shipping, and displaying physical books.
  Therefore, "whole categories of expense" refers to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
  The answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
The phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to the costs that are eliminated in the digital publishing model, specifically related to the production, distribution, and selling of physical books.
This means Option B "the price paid to have books printed and bound" is the most suitable option.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author explains the advantages of digital publishing over traditional publishing.
  The digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory, thereby eliminating certain costs.
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to all the costs that traditional publishing incurs which are not relevant to digital publication.
  Choices A, C, D, and E are not relevant to the phrase "whole categories of expense."
  B is the correct answer, as the cost of printing and binding books is no longer present in digital publishing.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The author describes how digital publication eliminates various costs associated with traditional publishing.
The author mentions warehousing, shipping to wholesalers and retail stores, displaying physical books in stores and returning unsold books to publishers.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Thought:
  In Passage A, the author opposed jury nullification. The author argues that jurors are not legislators and shouldn't decide the effect of an acquittal on others. Furthermore, the evidence for nullification decisions is insufficient, and the potential for evil ends is great.
  In Passage B, the author is supportive of jury nullification. The author sees a role for juries in some circumstances, such as when a law is unjust or can be better served by nullification.
  The authors appear to disagree with each other on the significance of jury nullification in the judicial system.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A argues against jury nullification's power to circumvent the purpose of elected legislature and the potential problems caused by it.
  Passage B views jury nullification as a safety valve that can assist the legislature to see where laws can be clarified.
  There is a difference in opinion on the usefulness of jury nullification in the passages, but none of the choices seem to touch directly on their disagreements. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A argues against the power of juries to nullify and questions its appropriate use.
  Passage B supports the power of juries to nullify and its usefulness in certain circumstances.
  The authors would most likely disagree over a topic that is directly or indirectly addressed in both passages.
  The passages do not address the transparency of juries' reasoning or the likelihood of elected officials being more biased than jurors.
  Passage A posits that jurors are not legislators and, hence, it is not their role to interpret the law.
  Passage B argues that a jury can be viewed as assisting the legislature.
  The authors would most likely disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries to interpret the law.
  The answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B describe the power of jury nullification.
  Passage A raises concerns about the problems of jury nullification, including uncertainty about how often the power is used and whether juries use it for good or evil ends, insufficient evidence, and the lack of accountability and obligation to think through the effects.
  Passage B describes the potential benefits of jury nullification, including serving as a safety valve and assisting the legislature by scrutinizing and debating laws.
  The two passages seem to be in disagreement over whether jury nullification is a problematic power or a useful one.
  The answer should reflect this disagreement.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A argues against the power of jury nullification.
  Passage B argues in favor of the power of jury nullification.
  The authors of the passages agree that there is a power of jury nullification, but they disagree over whether this power is desirable or not.
  Therefore, they would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues against the power of juries to nullify laws because juries are not required to explain their verdicts, they might not have sufficient evidence to make a reasonable nullification decision, and because they are not legislators and not accountable. 
  Passage B argues in favor of the power of juries to nullify laws because it can act as a safety valve against overzealous police and prosecutors, it can help the legislature by identifying problems with a law, and because instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon and only occur when all twelve of the jurors agree.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree over whether juries have the power to interpret the law.
  The jury only has the power to apply the law, not interpret it.
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A is generally critical of jury nullification and argues that the jury should not have the power to nullify the law which is the job of the elected legislature.
  Passage B is more positive about jury nullification and argues that it can be a useful safety valve when the law is being applied too harshly or unfairly.
  The authors might disagree over whether jury nullification is a useful function of the jury when the law is unfair or being applied too harshly.
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that jury nullification entails negative impacts and should not be accepted.
  While, Passage B argues that jury nullification is necessary when the criminal justice system is overzealous or the circumstances make the prosecution unjust.
  The authors agree on the idea of scrutinizing and debating the laws.
  The authors do not discuss the role of elected officials and the purview of juries in interpretation.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree over whether it is necessary for police and prosecutors to have discretion in deciding which violations of the law to pursue.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A contends that the power of jury nullification is problematic due to three main reasons, one of which is that jurors are not legislators.
  Passage B sees jury nullification as a useful safety valve and legislature-assisting tool.
  The authors' disagreement is most likely to revolve around their views of the usefulness of jury nullification.
  Passage A would likely see jury nullification as problematic due to jurors overreaching their bounds as non-legislators.
  Passage B sees the act of nullification as a way to prompt the legislative branch to scrutinize and debate certain laws.
  Therefore, the authors' disagreement might be on whether or not jury nullification can play a role in making necessary changes to laws.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A argues against the power and use of jury nullification.
  Passage B defends the jury's nullification power as a useful function.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration
  D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  E: Some of the refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.

Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment is most useful in determining whether a chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage mentions that CFCs chemically deplete the ozone layer.
  The passage also mentions that the depletion of the ozone layer occurs when CFCs break down into its components such as chlorine when exposed to ultraviolet light.
  Therefore, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation is the most useful experiment in determining whether a chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The answer is E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question is asking about what kind of information is needed to determine if a chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that the problem with CFCs is that they react with and deplete the ozone layer.
  Therefore, a useful experiment would involve testing how the potential replacement chemical interacts with the ozone layer or its precursors.
  The answer is A since it tests whether the potential replacement chemical can react with other types of oxygen, like oxygen molecules, instead of ozone, which would indicate whether it is capable of reacting with and depleting the ozone layer like CFCs do.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question asks which information would be most useful in determining the safety of chemicals that could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage discusses how CFCs cause damage to the ozone layer by breaking down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which react with ozone and cause ozone depletion.
  Therefore, it would be most useful to test whether a new chemical has the ability to chemically react with chlorine in the same way as CFCs, which would help predict whether the new chemical would also damage the ozone layer.
  The best answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The question is asking which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, based on the passage.
  The passage explains how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer by breaking down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation.
  Therefore, a chemical that can replace CFCs should not have similar properties that cause the breakdown of the ozone layer, such as reacting with chlorine or breaking down into its components due to ultraviolet radiation.
  Testing whether the chemical would react with forms of oxygen other than ozone or whether the chemical would react with other chemicals commonly found in the lower atmosphere may not provide relevant information to determine if the chemical could replace CFCs without harming the ozone layer.
  Testing the chemical properties of the constituent elements is not as important as testing the chemical as a whole.
  Therefore, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation is the most relevant experiment to determine whether the chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a chemical would replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage discusses how CFCs chemically react and deplete the ozone layer.
  Therefore, we need to find an experiment that tests if a chemical can replace CFCs without causing the depletion of the ozone layer.
  Choice A and D are irrelevant to the problem as they do not directly test for ozone depletion.
  Choice B is too broad and does not directly test for the chemical’s effect on the ozone layer.
  Choice C is the most relevant answer because it tests whether the new chemical would chemically react with chlorine, which is causing the depletion of the ozone. 
  Therefore C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  In order to determine whether a particular chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, the chemical must not chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  Molina and Rowland showed that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that CFCs break down into their constituent elements when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation and cause an increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere.
  Therefore, testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be the most useful experiment in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.

  The question is asking what experiment would be most useful in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that CFCs cause damage to the ozone layer through the process of chlorine atoms breaking down ozone molecules and then continuing to destroy more ozone before becoming inactive.
  Therefore, an experiment that tests whether a potential replacement for CFCs would follow a similar pattern of breaking down or reacting with chlorine would be most useful.
  Choice C describes an experiment that fits this description.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment will determine if a particular chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage describes how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  Molina and Rowland discovered that chlorine from CFCs destroys ozone in the atmosphere.
  Therefore, an experiment that tests if the chemical reacts with chlorine would be the most useful in determining whether that could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question is asking which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer according to the passage.
  According to the passage, CFCs lead to the depletion of the ozone layer by chemically attacking and depleting the ozone layer and increasing the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere which terminates the natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium.
  Therefore, testing to see whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine, similar to how CFCs react, would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question asks about determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage describes how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) deplete the ozone layer.
  CFCs slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere and break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine.
  The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  Therefore, we need to determine whether a particular chemical has the same chemical properties as CFCs, such as the ability to react with chlorine.
  Testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine would yield the most useful information.
  The answer is D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Thought:
In Passage A, the author explains the concept of 'disturbing forces.' Disturbing forces are one of the auxiliary premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc.
In Passage B, astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
They hypothesized that there should be no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. Later they found an error in the auxiliary assumption that another planet exists in the vicinity of Uranus, which affected the prediction of its orbit.
It means there is a possibility of external forces/disturbing forces affecting the orbit of Uranus.
Action: Answer("E") 
Therefore, E: the moon is the most likely answer because the gravitational attraction of the moon can cause disturbances in the motion of planets that can affect their orbits.
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The disturbing force can cause deviations from expected results.
  Passage B deals with astronomers who attempted to predict the orbit of a planet. 
  One of the auxiliary assumptions made was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  However, the astronomers found that their predictions were incorrect, and the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  They changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets and concluded that another planet must be close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  In this case, the disturbing force can be a planet close enough to Uranus to produce an observed orbit, which was not previously considered as part of the auxiliary assumptions.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question refers to line 26 in passage A, where the term "disturbing forces" is introduced.
  In passage B, the astronomers had auxiliary assumptions in addition to Newton's laws.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of planets in the vicinity of Uranus when the predicted orbit was incorrect.
  The astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet, Vulcan, that was never found.
  It is most likely that a disturbing force is a factor outside of the relevant theory or hypothesis that can directly influence the system being studied.
  Uranus, the sun, Neptune, and Mercury are all part of the planetary system being studied.
  Only the Moon is a body outside of the planetary system being studied.
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The answer would be an instance of a disturbing force, as described in Passage A.
  According to Passage A, a "disturbing force" refers to another factor that influences the results of a scientific prediction or experiment.
  In Passage B, the astronomers made observations to predict the orbit of Mercury.
  They used auxiliary assumptions, which include factors such as instrumentation and the absence of disturbing forces.
  The astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Mercury, which was later determined to be incorrect.
  To explain the observation, they hypothesized the existence of another planet they called "Vulcan" which was also never found.
  Both the existence of "Vulcan" and the incorrect prediction can be attributed to a disturbing force.
  The most likely disturbing force is something that interfered with the orbit of Mercury.
  According to Passage B, this is exactly what happened. Einstein's theory of general relativity predicted Mercury's orbit, which led to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Mercury.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The question refers to a term mentioned in Passage A.
  In Passage A, disturbing forces were explained to be auxiliary premises which could affect the validity of a theory.
  In Passage B, the discovery of Uranus was based on auxiliary assumptions and predictions.
  One of these assumptions was the absence of planets near Uranus, and when the observed orbit was not in alignment with the predicted orbit, this assumption was changed indicating that a planet was in the vicinity of Uranus.
  Therefore, the planet discovered near Uranus is the best answer as it is an example of a disturbing force information that affected the orbit of Uranus.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The author describes auxiliary premises that appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc.
  In passage B, astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and other planets. The author mentions the possible existence of a disturbing force.
  One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions.  
  Therefore, the answer is likely to be the mass of one of the planets or the sun, which can cause a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Popper suggests that there are auxiliary premises and disturbing forces that could cause predictions to fail.
  In passage B, astronomers made predictions about Uranus's orbit based on auxiliary assumptions.
  They later found out that the orbit did not match what they predicted, leading them to assume that an unknown planet was affecting Uranus's orbit.
  Thus, it is more plausible that this unknown planet is the disturbing force in this illustration.
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The question refers to Passage A which talks about the use of "auxiliary" premises and "disturbing forces" in scientific research.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and how the planets beyond Saturn were discovered.
  The discovery of Neptune was due to the failure of the auxiliary premise that there were no other planets near Uranus.
  In the case of the orbit of Mercury, scientists initially assumed that there was another planet - Vulcan - responsible for the irregularities in its orbit.
  The existence of Vulcan was never confirmed, and Einstein's general theory of relativity explained the discrepancies.
  None of these examples provides a clear illustration of a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  In passage A, the author mentions that auxiliary premises include those that appeal to the absence of disturbing forces.
  Passage B refers to auxiliary assumptions when astronomers tried to predict the orbit of Uranus.
  The astronomers' calculations did not match their observations.
  One possible explanation was an error in the auxiliary assumptions.
  This explanation entails the possibility of disturbing forces affecting the orbit of Uranus.
  Therefore, auxiliary assumptions may include assumptions about disturbing forces.
  Answer: Uranus illustrates a disturbing force, as it affected the predictions of astronomers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage describes astronomers predicting the orbit of Uranus and Mercury based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The auxiliary assumptions about Uranus included the assumption that no planets existed in its vicinity.
  The astronomers discovered the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  One possible explanation was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions, and thus, another planet must exist close to Uranus.
  Neptune was discovered in the precise place, which brought their calculations into alignment with the observations.
  In the case of Mercury's orbit, Einstein's theory led to the correct predictions.
  The passage does not provide any information on how the moon, the sun, or Uranus caused any disturbing force.
  Therefore, among the answer choices, Neptune is the only possible answer that is relevant to the passage.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?
Choices:
  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.
  B: The primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers aud haudheld devices for reading text.
  C: The growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
  D: Any book will sell more copies ifit is published digitally thau if it is published traditionally.
  E: Digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.
Response 0:
Thought:
The author argues for the economic benefits of digital publishing, which offers greater efficiency and convenience, reduces production costs, and makes publishing much less expensive. Established publishers initially will be reluctant to embrace digital publishing. Nevertheless, digital publishing will prevail over traditional publishing in the future. But it will take some time before digital publishing reaches the critical mass that justifies investment in book printing machines at a regional level. The author implies that traditional publishers will eventually have to adjust to the new reality of digital publishing or they will lose their business.
Action: Answer("A") 
Choice A is correct because the author implies that publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be likely to remain economically uncompetitive. Choice B is not supported because the author does not mention computers and handheld devices as a primary threat to the spread of digital publishing; the author believes that digital publishing will eventually become the norm. Choice C is not supported because the author does not discuss the growth of digital publishing in revitalizing the book retail business. Choice D is contradicted by the author's statement that digital publishing will eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing. Choice E is not supported because the author does not mention advertising in the context of digital publishing.
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author argues that the new digital model of publishing will likely supplant or at least rival traditional publishing because it is more economically efficient and convenient for customers. 
  He also suggests that established publishing houses would be reluctant to adopt the new model because they are heavily invested in traditional practices and infrastructure.
  So, it can be inferred that the author would agree with the statement that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author argues that digital publishing is more efficient and cost-effective than traditional publishing.
  Established publishing houses might be reluctant to accept this new economic model.
  Upstart digital publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure will have the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts.
  Traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors.
  The caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future may help explain the adjustments that they will have to make.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
The author discusses the advantages of digital publishing, including its economic efficiency and convenience. The author also discusses the impact that this new digital model could have on traditional publishing. While the author suggests that traditional publishers may initially resist the move to digital publishing, the author does not suggest that failure to embrace digital publishing will make them "economically uncompetitive." Nor does the author suggest that the primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers and handheld devices. The author notes that anyone with internet access will be able to purchase printed versions of books from a digital catalog, which implies that traditional bookstores might not benefit from the growth of digital publishing. The author does not suggest that "any book" will sell more copies if it is published digitally rather than traditionally. Finally, while the author notes that the elimination of printing, shipping, and warehousing costs associated with traditional publishing could allow publishers to reduce the amount of money they spend on advertising, the passage does not suggest that digital publishing itself will "allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The author states that most digital files of books will be printed on demand by machines, eliminating the cost of warehousing, shipping, displaying and returning unsold books to publishers.

Response 7:
Thought:
  The author suggests that digital publishing will eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing because of its economic efficiency and convenience.
  The author mentions that established publishers initially will be reluctant to accede to the demands of authors and agents for a larger share of the proceeds, which creates an opportunity for upstart digital-publishing firms.
  It can be inferred that publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing and do not adjust their redundant functions accordingly may lose their authors, but the passage does not suggest that they will be economically competitive.
  The passage does not mention any threat to the spread of digital publishing related to the widespread use of computers or handheld devices for reading text.
  The passage does not mention that the growth of digital publishing will revitalize the book retail business, so this is an unlikely statement the author would agree with.
  The passage suggests that digital publishing will allow publishers to eliminate the costs of advertising their books but does not suggest that publishers will substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage points out that Dostoyevsky took a third position that differed from the opposing directions in Russian literary criticism, including the radical view that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality. Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but reality was far more than the merely tangible, and there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality. The fantastic is intimately bound up with the real, and a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit." Therefore, it can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question is asking for an inference from the passage about Dostoyevsky's stance on the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky took a different position and believed that reality was crucial to literature, but that it went deeper than just the tangible aspects.
  The passage does not mention explicitly if Dostoyevsky agreed or disagreed with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  However, he did believe that the requirement that art must stand high above reality or that it must be useful was unsatisfactory.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would likely have disagreed with the statement that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's opinion on literature, reality, and the role of art.
  Dostoyevsky's view of reality is that it cannot be defined in a singular way as it is perceived uniquely by each individual.
  Dostoyevsky believed in 'fantastic', which is not necessarily what exists but what could/should/may exist.
  The radical critics who held the view that art should stand high above reality and the everyday were opposed to the radical view that art should serve a societal end and should be useful.
  Therefore, Dostoevsky would have disagreed with the position that art should be useful or serve a particular political view.
  Option A refers to the fantastic element, but it is not specific to the given view of some Russian critics.
  Option B reflects Dostoyevsky's own view of reality, and is not directly related to the given statement.
  Option C is incorrect because Dostoyevsky is a realist who believed that reality is crucial to literature.
  Option D is a view specific to Dostoevsky and does not relate to the given viewpoint.
  Option E accurately describes Dostoyevsky's opposition to the idea that art should further some social end.
  Therefore, the answer is E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source for literature, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
He argued that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it and the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
He also believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit" and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
He disagreed with the radical critics' view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
Action: Answer("E") 
Therefore, it can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would have agreed with the statement that the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage clearly mentions Dostoyevsky's opinion on the matter.
  Dostoyevsky's position was different from the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of literature but it went beyond what the radical critics defined as reality.
  The passage doesn't indicate that Dostoyevsky agreed with the position that art should have a strong element of the fantastic.
  The passage doesn't indicate that Dostoyevsky agreed with the position that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  The passage doesn't indicate that Dostoyevsky believed that reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  The passage does indicate that Dostoyevsky believed the view held by some Russian critics that art should further some societal end was incorrect.
  Therefore, the answer is E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  From the passage, we know that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view that art should only depict concrete reality and promote social agendas. He had his own understanding of reality and believed that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit, regardless of its political agenda. 
  The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky would agree with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky took a third position which differed from the two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during his time.
  The first position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday.
  The radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky considered the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" meaningless.
  Reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit,".
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
  Therefore, it cannot be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
Action: Answer("NoneOfTheAbove")
Response 7:
Thought:
From the passage, Dostoyevsky didn't agree with the radical view that art should only find its sources in concrete reality. 
Dostoyevsky believed that reality was a crucial source, but he defined reality quite differently than the radical critics. 
He believed that there was no distinction between fantasy and reality, and that reality was shaped by the person experiencing it. 
Moreover, he found the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" meaningless.
Dostoyevsky believed that the fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real and the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the real world.
Dostoyevsky also maintained that literary works must stand or fall on their "artistic merit," and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance was a contradiction in terms.
Finally, Dostoyevsky was critical of the radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view.

Action: Answer("E") 
It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have disagreed with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question asks for Dostoevsky's opinion on the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday. 
  According to the passage, Dostoevsky did not agree with the radical critics' view that art had to be useful to be of value. 
  Dostoevsky also believed that reality is the source of literature but distinguished himself from the radical critics by suggesting that reality for an individual is not be defined by tangible facts.
  Dostoyevsky believed that the fantastic must be intimately bound with real life.
  Therefore, we can infer that Dostoevsky may not have agreed with the view that 
          - reality must be the foundation of all literature.
          - art should not have an element of the fantastic.
          - art should serve a specific societal goal.
  The view that "art should stand high above present and everyday" seems to suggest that art should not be concerned with the mundane realities of the world and instead strive for a higher ideal. 
  Dostoevsky's position on the reality-fantasy boundary suggests that he would not agree with the idea. 
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices (B) and (C) as it is unlikely that Dostoevsky would agree with them.
  Option (A) appears to be a partial view as it only mentions the importance of the fantastic element, and Dostoyevsky's view was more comprehensive. 
  Dostoevsky claims that artistic merit addresses a writer’s capacity to depict their thoughts through characters and images and not just the ability to add the magnificent to the mundane. 
  Hence he would disagree that artistic value only comes from fantastic elements.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choice (A) as it is not a comprehensive answer. 
  Option (D) seems to be consistent with Dostoyevsky's view that the fantastic must be intimately bound with reality.
  The radical critic's demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  He emphasized that writers should explode the boundaries of the so-called real world, which implies that reality was not a constraint on literature. 
  Therefore, we can infer that the statement related to 'no distinction between reality and fantasy' aligns with Dostoevsky's opinion. Option (D) seems most in line with the content of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The statement is referring to one position held by Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.
  Dostoyevsky was a realist who believed that reality was the crucial source of literature.
  Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The task of a writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  For Dostoyevsky, the radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society was unsatisfactory.
  Therefore, the correct answer is not E.
  Dostoyevsky believed that fantasy was a necessary part of art, so the correct answer would not be A.
  The passage states that reality was a crucial source of literature and Dostoyevsky believed there was no distinction between reality and fantasy, so the correct answer is not C.
  B is the most accurate answer because it acknowledges the fact that Dostoyevsky was a realist and that he believed that reality was the crucial source of literature but it goes further in saying that Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than that of the radical critics. For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality and reality was far more than the merely tangible.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: The author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings (lines 38–43) primarily to
Choices:
  A: show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life
  B: support the claim that Lichtenstein's work was parodic in intent
  C: contrast Lichtenstein's approach to art with that of abstract expressionism
  D: suggest the emotions that lie at the heart of Lichtenstein's work
  E: endorse Lichtenstein's attitude toward consumer culture
Response 0:
Thought:
  The lines 38-43 list the objects and themes that Lichtenstein's work is based on, such as comic books, stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps. 
  The author mentions that these mundane objects were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein lived in.
  Therefore, the author most likely lists some of the themes and objects to show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life.
  The answer is A: show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author lists some of the themes and objects appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings.
  The author talked about how Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism in depicting contemporary life.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage discusses Roy Lichtenstein's work and how it merged popular culture and fine art.
Lines 38-43 state that Lichtenstein used objects such as automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps from the culture he inhabited in his paintings.
Therefore, the author most likely lists some of the themes and objects to demonstrate that Lichtenstein's paintings depict aspects of contemporary life.
The answer is A: show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage mentions the paintings of Lichtenstein were reflections of the culture he inhabited.
  The description of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings aims to shed light on the "kind of deliberate naivete" in his paintings and to show that his persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation.
  Therefore, the answer is not B and D.
  The themes and objects are not used in the passage to contrast Lichtenstein's approach to art with that of abstract expressionism. 
  Although Lichtenstein's paintings depict aspects of contemporary life, the author intends to show something more in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is not A.
  The passage does not endorse Lichtenstein's attitude toward consumer culture. The author acknowledges that if Lichtenstein's work was a rebellion against something, it was against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Therefore, the answer is not E.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The themes and objects presented in Lichtenstein's paintings are described.
  The author mentions the depiction of contemporary life in line 46 which implies that this information might not be the primary reason for mentioning these themes.
  The author has already established the parodic intent of Lichtenstein's work in relation to fine art, therefore this information might not be the primary reason for mentioning the themes either.
  The paragraph contrasts Lichtenstein's approach to art with that of abstract expressionism, so this information seems relevant to the topic discussed.
  The author is not suggesting the emotions lying at the heart of Lichtenstein's work, but instead is discussing how Lichtenstein used popular themes and sophisticated techniques to create a complex result.
  The author does not necessarily endorse Lichtenstein's attitude toward consumer culture, which is actually discussed as being different from other pop artist in line 64.
  
Therefore, the primary reason the author lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings is to contrast Lichtenstein's approach to art with that of abstract expressionism.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage mentions the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings.

  Likely, the author is contrasting Lichtenstein's approach to art with that of abstract expressionism by highlighting the thematic aspect of his work.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author describes the themes and objects depicted in Lichtenstein's paintings, such as comics, romances, war stories, and consumer products.
  The author mentions the reflection and nostalgia displayed in his paintings.
  The author discusses how Lichtenstein's work blends popular genres with fine art, and how his work is not solely parody but also displays an urge toward realism.
  The author contrasts Lichtenstein's work with abstract expressionism and discusses the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Therefore, the author likely lists the themes and objects in Lichtenstein's paintings to contrast his approach with that of abstract expressionism and to suggest that his work is a blend of popular genres and fine art that reflects contemporary life.
  The answer is C: contrast Lichtenstein's approach to art with that of abstract expressionism.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses Lichtenstein's work, highlighting his style and intentions.
  Particularly, it explains that, beyond parody, Lichtenstein's paintings conveyed realism and nostalgia.
  Lines 38-43 list some of the themes and objects that appear in Lichtenstein's paintings, such as comics and the depiction of contemporary life.
  Therefore, the purpose of listing those themes and objects is probably to explain that Lichtenstein's work was influenced by pop culture and that he had a fascination with using it in fine art.
  The mention of those themes and objects doesn't seem to support any other purpose entirely.
Action: Answer("A")

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement refers to arbitrary, unpredictable, or whimsical enforcement of a law.
  Not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law is a potential explanation for capricious enforcement.
  In Passage A, discretionary non-enforcement is allowed, but capricious enforcement is not the central tendency.
  Therefore, if capricious enforcement occurs, it is likely due to not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that discretionary nonenforcement is a technique used to reduce the costs of overinclusion of laws.
  Capricious enforcement is not unknown, but not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Capricious enforcement appears to be the opposite of enforcement according to the legislature's intent.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is most likely when law enforcement personnel do not follow the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  According to Passage A, discretionary nonenforcement is allowed by law, but arbitrary or capricious enforcement is not allowed as legislative oversight is assumed to be present.
  There is no description in Passage A that suggest an instance of "capricious enforcement".
  However, "capricious enforcement" can be inferred from the statement "Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced." (line 33-36) which implies that it is possible but not common.
  Therefore, an instance of "capricious enforcement" is most likely for the law enforcement agency to not follow the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement means an unpredictable or impulsive enforcement.
  Passage A suggests that discretionary non-enforcement can be exercised without being capricious.
  The legislatures' intent in passing the laws is the determining factor for the law enforcement agency
  Capricious enforcement is not the central tendency.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement means arbitrary or unpredictable enforcement of the law.
  The passage suggests that capricious enforcement is not the central tendency.
  Legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Capricious enforcement can be a rare occurrence, but it cannot be the central tendency.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement means not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses the technique of discretionary non-enforcement when enforcing an overinclusive rule.
  Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs and can be reduced by discretionary non-enforcement.
  Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but does not appear to be the central tendency.
  Legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement means unpredictable enforcement.
  The passage says that capricious enforcement exists but it is not common.
  Legislative oversight helps to restrict the enforcement within the intended regulation.
  None of the given choices indicate capricious enforcement.
  Therefore, none of the choices is the answer.
Action: Answer("E")  # Selecting the most likely answer even though none of the choices indicate capricious enforcement.
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement refers to unpredictably enforcing the law, which happens but it's not central tendency.
  It doesn't seem like it refers to enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible.
  It doesn't seem like it refers to prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes.
  It doesn't seem like it refers to not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law.
  It seems like it most likely refers to not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A states that "Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare)" (line 33-34).
  Capricious enforcement is enforcement that is unpredictable.
  The passage suggests that legislative oversight is in place to ensure that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement means operating on whims or impulse rather than principle.
  The passage states that capricious enforcement is not unknown or rare.
  The passage adds, however, that legislative oversight helps to ensure law enforcement does not stray too far from the intended regulation.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the use of utility maximization to reconcile two sides of the crime deterrence debate.
  The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  A person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.
  The passage demonstrates that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  None of the answer choices clearly relate to the passage's discussion of the use of an economic principle to reconcile two positions in a debate.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how the utility maximization principle provides a framework for analyzing the deterrence of crimes.
  This new framework allows scholars to reconcile the two positions that were previously debated.
  By analyzing a person's decision to commit a deliberate crime, the various factors that impact crime deterrence can be analyzed.
  The scenario that is similar to the scholars' use of the utility maximization principle is one where an idea or concept from one field is applied to another field to help solve a problem or provide insight in a new context.
  None of the choices seem directly related to the passage or relevant to legal scholarship.
  None of the choices describe applying a principle or concept from one field to another field.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The question asks which scenario is similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
  The passage mentions that recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of the debate by introducing the economic principle of utility maximization, which analyzes an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, the answer choice should describe a scenario in which a principle or idea from one field is used to help solve a problem in a different field.
  Option D, a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a legal case, fits this description quite well.
  The passage does not mention anything about cosmology, optics, botany, or short quotations from novels in the context of crime deterrence.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses legal scholars who use the utility maximization principle to reconcile two positions on crime deterrence.
  According to the principle of utility maximization, individuals make rational choices that maximize their expected overall satisfaction.
  A person will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity, given the chance of getting caught.
  The two deterrence methods (increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement vs increasing economic opportunities of individuals) both affect the utility equation and, therefore, lower the expected utility from criminal activity.
  The use of the utility maximization principle to analyze a rational person's decision to commit a crime is most similar to a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case because both involve applying a principle or theory to the analysis of a legal issue.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle of economics to analyze the deliberate crime deterrence methods.
  Legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to suggest that criminal activity can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  Given a choice of actions, people will choose an action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The most effective way to deter deliberate crimes involves increased expected utility from lawful activity and decreased expected utility from criminal activity.
  Legal scholars' use of utility maximization principle, not as an opposing but complementary to societal norms, institutions, and individual choice, is similar to:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
The passage discusses the utility maximization principle and its application to understanding crime deterrence.
It indicates that the principle helps us analyze how an individual's decision to commit a crime can be seen as a rational economic choice.
This helps us understand the role of deterrence in crime prevention.
The question asks us to identify a scenario that is most similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle.
Action: Answer("D") 
Based on the passage, legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle is most similar to a Judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage relates a debate between scholars who have different views on how to reduce deliberate crimes.
  The debate is between those who believe deliberate crimes are a product of societal norms and institutions on individuals, and those who believe that the decision to commit deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice.
  Some legal scholarship has introduced an economic principle known as utility maximization which allows the rationality of an individual's decision to commit a crime to be analyzed.
  Within this principle, an individual will choose to commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.
  Therefore, the principle is used to analyze and understand why individuals commit crimes.
  The best choice is an answer option where a principle is being borrowed from a related or unrelated field to explain another phenomenon within the context of that other field.
  A is unrelated to the passage; B, C, and E do describe principles borrowed from one field to understand another, but the principle they describe is not necessarily related to crime deterrence.
  D is similar to the use of the economic principle of utility maximization in crimes deterrence debate in that anthropology offers a new perspective on the case.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  Legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to analyze crime deterrence.
  The passage does not mention any other science or field.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, or D.
  E is not related to the debate over crime deterrence.
  The answer is not E.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses a principle of economics called utility maximization that can explain the decision making process behind the commission of a deliberate crime.
  Rational individuals choose actions that maximize their overall satisfaction.
  The utility is ascertained by determining the utilities of possible outcomes of that action and weighing the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding those weighted utilities.
  The principle of utility maximization is used by some legal scholars to explain both deterrence methods - increasing fines and penalties and rehabilitation.
  Both methods aim to decrease the expected utility of criminal activity.
  The question asks for the scenario most similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
Action: Answer("D") 
  In this scenario, a judge's use of evidence from anthropology can explain the decision-making process behind a controversial legal case. A similar usage of the utility maximization principle to explain the decision-making process behind the commission of a deliberate crime is made by some legal scholars.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes the utility maximization principle as an economic framework that can be used to analyze individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice. It also states that the recommendations by both sides in the crime deterrence debate would result in lowering the expected utility from criminal activity or increasing the expected utility from lawful activity. 
  The answer choice that best fits a scenario that is most similar to some legal scholar's use of the utility maximization principle would be one where a principle from one field was used to support an argument in another field.
  Answer choices A, C, D, and E use metaphors, quotations, and evidence to support arguments, but they do not describe a scenario where a principle from one field was used to describe an event or phenomenon in another field.
  Answer choice B uses a law of optics from physics to demonstrate a concept in drawing, which is similar to using the utility maximization principle from economics to describe the decision-making process in criminal behavior.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question asks what could have reduced the time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  The passage mentions that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei was experimentally demonstrated.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  The puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified partly because the expectation was that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Lise Meitner, a physicist, discovered the significance of data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations and coined the term "nuclear fission."
  Therefore, the answer would most likely involve reducing the expectation or increasing the awareness of the physicists regarding the possibility of splitting atoms.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not realize they were splitting atoms.
  The discovery could have been made earlier if certain factors had been different.
  To reduce the amount of time for physicists to realize that atoms were being split, an approach which removed the factors that held back the physicists would have been helpful.
  Option B suggests that "the physicists conducting the experiments...did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products."
  Removing expectations from the researchers would have helped them realize that they were splitting atoms without bias and preconceptions.
  Option B is the best answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that the scientists were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms and were expecting the by-products to have a nuclear composition close to uranium.
  Thus, what could have reduced time is an experimental setup that directed the attention of scientists towards the phenomenon of nuclear fission.
  Given this, option B is the most likely choice, since it states that the physicists had no particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that physicists who conducted experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium produced evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without realizing they were splitting atoms.
  The passage also suggests that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Therefore, it may have taken less time for physicists to realize that atoms were being split if they had known about these calculations or had been more aware of the possibility of splitting atoms.
  Answer choice C indicates that the physicists conducting the experiments had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  Therefore, if that were true, it would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that scientists compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  The key theoretical connection that explained this had been overlooked for a long period of time.
  The scientific community contributing to this work had produced calculations indicating that atomic nuclei could be divided before this research began.
  Researchers were not receptive to the possibility of atomic nuclei being divided in this context.
  Lise Meitner was able to make this theoretical connection from a different set of research.
  Therefore, the most likely choice that would have reduced the amount of time, is the one that would increase the researchers' awareness to the possibility of atomic nuclei being divided.
  The only choice that makes sense would be (C) that suggests if researchers conducting the experiments would have been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle atoms can be split, it would have increased their chances of identifying the nucleus' division more promptly.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how it took a while for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Meitner realized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, and coined the term "nuclear fission".
  A, B, C and D are all variables that could have made the discovery occur faster.
  E is out of context since the passage does not describe experiments of physicists in neutron barrage of any other substance apart from uranium.
  From the passage, the main issue was the right conceptual link to understand what was going on, which Meitner provided to the physicists.
  The answer is not clearly stated in the passage, but among the variables provided, B can be argued to be the most likely.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The delay in recognizing that atoms were being split was due to the lack of proper conceptual understanding.
  The experiments were geared towards seeking something other than splitting atoms.
  Physicists did not expect that splitting atoms was possible in the context of their experiments.
  To reduce the amount of time it took to recognize that atoms were being split, something must have happened to either change their perspective or to show them the possibilities of splitting atoms in their experiments.
  Option A does not seem relevant to the delay.
  Option B is opposite to what is stated in the context.
  Option C is also opposite to what is stated in the context.
  Option D may have helped to reduce the amount of time by providing more experimental results, but it still does not solve the main issue.
  Option E does not seem relevant to the context.
  None of the options present a clear solution. However, option D is the most relevant one. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The physicists had not recognized that they were witnessing nuclear fission despite compiling increasing evidence that it had been achieved.
  They were not even receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments.
  Precise chemical analyses were hampered by the difficulties in working with highly radioactive materials.
  The correlation between the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium with the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus demonstrated that uranium atoms were splitting.
  The crucial theoretical connection was provided by Lise Meitner.
  Therefore, if the physicists conducting the experiments did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear compositions of the by-products, they would have recognized earlier that they were witnessing nuclear fission.
  The answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that the physicists had been compiling increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved even before Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  The passage also mentions that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating it should be possible to break atoms apart before the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The passage implies that the expectation that the by-products would be elements close to uranium also hindered recognition that the atoms were being split.
  Therefore, if the physicists conducting the experiments did not have such an expectation regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, it seems plausible that the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split would be reduced.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that the discovery of nuclear fission took some time.
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939, without, (recognizing what they were witnessing).
	Marginal note: physicists did not immediately realize that they had split atoms (nuclear fission), instead, it took researchers some time to recognize the significance of their findings.
  The passage does not describe any specific factor that would reduce the amount of time it took to identify nuclear fission.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

  The passage presents three significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  One position prioritizes art's elevation from the present and the everyday, while the other one believes art can find its sources in concrete reality and must contribute to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position, which was different from the radical critics' positions.
  His understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  Reality was far more than tangible, and reality was shaped by the person who experienced it.
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  The utilitarian claim that only a work of art which is useful to people and society can be considered valuable seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.
  Therefore, the third position taken by Dostoyevsky is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  The answer is B: Three positions are presented, and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage presents three different positions or views in Russian literary criticism.
  The first view is that art is elevated above everyday life, the second view is that art has to be only useful, and the third view is Dostoyevsky's own position.
  Dostoyevsky's position is different from the other two, as he believes that reality goes beyond the tangible, and does not agree with the other two positions, as he believes that a work of art should not be confined to either being useful or elevated.
  The passage devotes a significant amount of detail to Dostoyevsky's position, as opposed to the other two.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the correct answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage presents three positions.
  The first two viewpoints are described briefly.
  The third viewpoint stands out and is described in detail.
  The third viewpoint is presented as distinct from the first two.
  The passage does not explicitly state that the third viewpoint is superior or inferior to the other views.
  The best answer choice is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The first position believes that art should be distant from reality and everyday.
  The second position believes that art should only be created based on concrete reality and contribute to creating a new society.
  The third position, which Dostoyevsky took, believes that reality is the crucial source of literature but goes deeper compared to the second position.
  Dostoyevsky believes that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality and the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Also, Dostoyevsky believes that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck as a contradiction in terms.
  Thus, the author presents three positions and differentiates the third one from the first two in detail.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses three significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The positions are referred to in the passage as the high art position, the radical view, and Dostoyevsky's position.
  The passage elaborates in detail the high art position and the radical view in order to differentiate Dostoyevsky's position from them.
  The passage emphasizes on how Dostoyevsky's position goes deeper than the radical view in understanding reality and how it views the fantastic as being intimately bound up with the real world.
  The passage also emphasizes how Dostoyevsky's definition of artistry is quite simply the ability to write well and how he believed that art must stand or fall on its artistic merit rather than its usefulness to society.
  Therefore, the most accurate organization of the material presented in the passage is that three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  The answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses three significant positions in Russian literary criticism and Dostoyevsky's take on those positions.
  The first position holds that art is above the present and the everyday.
  The second position argues that art should be useful by finding its sources in concrete reality and exposing want and injustice.
  Dostoyevsky takes a third position that is different from the first two positions.
  Dostoyevsky believes that reality and fantasy are not separate and that there is another sphere, the fantastic that is bound up with reality.
  Dostoyevsky emphasizes that literary works must stand or fall on their artistic merit.
  The radical critics require that art must be useful, but Dostoyevsky disagrees.
  Dostoyevsky points out that the usefulness of art cannot be predicted.
  Therefore, the third position is differentiated from the first two positions in detail.
  The answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses three positions in Russian literary criticism.
  The first position that is discussed maintains art's superiority, the second position demands art's usefulness, and the third position, which Dostoyevsky takes, emphasizes the importance of reality but through a deeper understanding.
  The passage primarily focuses on Dostoyevsky's position and how his view differs from the other two.
  Therefore, the correct answer should explain how the third position is differentiated from the other two.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a kind of conspiracy theory because evolutionary psychology explains the behavior of individuals by imputing an interest (gene proliferation) that the agent of the behavior doesn't acknowledge.
  From passage A, a behavior that seems unselfish may actually promote the self-propagation of genes.
  Therefore, the assertion that "Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish" exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  In Passage B, the author uses the term "conspiracy theory" to describe Evolutionary Psychology because it attributes an interest (the proliferation of genes) to an agent of behavior that is not acknowledged or known.
  The crucial point is that a particular behavior is reasonable only if one had that interest.
  The behavioral examples presented in Passage A suggest that altruistic behaviors promote gene self-propagation, regardless of whether the individual is aware of it.
  Answer D presents an instance where genes promote gene self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage B says that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it attributes hidden motives (like the interest of genes) to explain behavior, which the agent of the behavior is not aware of.
  The example given in Passage B is of inferring that humans form monogamous families because of their interest in propagating their genes.
  Choice D from Passage A states that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, explaining seemingly altruistic behavior.
  This assertion from Passage A exemplifies the kind of hidden motive that Passage B thinks evolutionary psychology relies on.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author of passage B calls evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
  The author of passage A suggests that genes promoting their self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Choice D most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author of passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology because it explains behaviour by imputing an underlying interest, which the agent might not even be aware of.
  One assertion from passage A that exemplifies this conspiracy theory concept can help answer this question.
  Based on the context of passage A, we can infer that the answer should describe how evolutionary psychology explains behavior that the agent might not be aware of, but that it produces because of an interest in the proliferation of genes.
  The assertion that exemplifies this concept is the one that describes how genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The author of passage B sees evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory because it attributes behavior to an interest (proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior is not aware of.
  To find the assertion from passage A that exemplifies this point, we look for an assertion that explains a behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not acknowledge or is not aware of.
  Only assertion D meets this criterion by stating that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The question asks for an example in which Evolutionary psychology could be seen as a "conspiracy theory".
  Passage B indicates that this phrase is used to criticize the fact that evolutionary psychology tries to explain individuals' behavior based on underlying motivations that the individuals are not aware of.
  In Passage A, the fourth sentence indicates that genes for identification and empathy could be responsible for apparently altruistic behavior.
  Passage A's explanation of apparently unselfish behavior can be seen as a "conspiracy theory" as it suggests that genes are the underlying cause of an individual's actions.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology from the point of view of how it examines human behavior.
  It explains that evolutionary psychology seeks to explain human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success and genetic material of the individuals exhibiting the behavior.
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it imputes an interest (proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or even aware of the behavior.
  It points out that what is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest.
  Answer D exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it suggests that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  The behavior seems altruistic but it is actually in the interest of genes to promote their self-propagation.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory.
  The passage explains that evolutionary psychology attributes interests and motives to individuals that they are not aware of.
  The author argues that there can be multiple reasons for a particular behavior, and asserting a particular interest or motive as the primary reason is rare.
  Therefore, the author of passage B would be critical of evolutionary psychology attempting to attribute motives to behavior based on the self-propagation of genes.
  The example that most closely exemplifies this is D, where evolutionary psychology suggests that genes promote their self-propagation through unselfish actions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that the evolution of altruistic behavior might be explained by promoting the propagation of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. 
  Passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is like a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of.
  The argument in passage A that the evolution of behavior is linked to enhancing the survival and replication of genes that might appear as unselfish may exemplify what the author is saying in passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a type of autobiography produced by Native Americans that emerged from collaborative efforts involving two different cultures or perspectives.
  The passage states that scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  Traditional modes of communicating personal history have been overlooked by scholars, who have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples.
  Based on this, we can infer that "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a written product created by Native Americans in collaboration with non-Native American collaborators.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  - The passage explains that most scholars studying the autobiographies of Native Americans have focused on written documents called as-told-to life histories.
  - These documents emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
  - The author then explains what is meant by "bicultural composite authorship"
  - According to the passage, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that non-Native American collaborators transcribed and edited the as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
  - Therefore, the correct answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" means that the autobiographies of Native Americans were created by two individuals from two different cultures, one of whom solicited, recorded, and edited the stories; and the other one who told the story in a bicultural manner, therefore contributing to the finished product. 
This definition matches option "B" and not the other answer choices.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
In line 5, the author mentions "bicultural composite authorship."
The phrase seems to imply that there are multiple authors (composite authorship) who belong to different cultures (bicultural) contributing in some way to a finished piece of writing.
Therefore, the best option is D, where the original writer is from one culture and then revised by a member of another culture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  According to the context, bicultural composite authorship describes As-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators that emerged from the "bicultural composite authorship."
  The given answer choices represent different interpretations of the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" in the context of this passage.
  Option A says "written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture," which cannot be correct, since the passage clearly states that these histories were not written by Native Americans themselves.
  Option B refers to "two people belonging to different cultures," which also doesn't conform to the definition given in the context.
  Option C also seems unlikely. There is no reference to identities being unknown or unknowable.
  Option E is close to being correct, but isn't broad enough to cover all the characteristics.
  Option D accurately describes bicultural composite authorship.
  Therefore, the answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" talks about how most scholars have focused on a specific type of autobiographies of Native Americans that were produced in specific ways.
  The passage explains what is meant by that phrase in lines 3-5 and 19-23.
  The author mentions that these autobiographies are "as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
  According to the text, these types of autobiographies describe the first contact with non-indigenous cultures, and are not the main focus of the essay.
  Therefore, none of the choices is a correct explanation of the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship."
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The term "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe a type of life history in the context of Native Americans.
  Scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories as a measure of the autobiographies of Native Americans.
  Scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  The passage indicates that the term "bicultural composite authorship" relates to the idea of non-Native American collaborators soliciting, translating, recording, and editing Native American life histories.
  Therefore, the answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
These life histories were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
The phrase is used to describe a specific type of collaboration.
Option A, which states that the written documents are based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture, is not quite accurate because the passage does not clearly suggest that the documents are based on artifacts.
Option B states that the written documents are written by two people from different cultures who contribute in the same way to the finished product, but the passage does not suggest that the collaborators contribute in the same way, only that they collaborated.
Option C suggests that the writings were compiled from cultures whose identities cannot be determined, but this is not supported by the passage.
Option D is close to the correct answer but it suggests that the collaborator edited and revised the original work. The passage only indicates that the collaborations included soliciting, translating, recording, and editing the life histories.
Option E is not correct because it suggests that the life histories were merely based on oral communication by a member of another culture.
Therefore, the correct answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to  as-told-to life histories.
The life histories were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
The word 'composite' suggests that the stories are made up of multiple perspectives.
The word 'bicultural' suggests that the collaborators were from two different cultures.
Therefore, 'bicultural composite authorship' most accurately conveys the idea of a story that is told by a Native American but recorded and translated into a written document by non-Native Americans, which is a composite of different perspectives. 
The answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe most as-told-to life histories.
  These accounts are solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The term "bicultural" indicates the involvement of two cultures, Native American and non-Native American.
  The term "composite authorship" implies that the finished product is the result of contributions from both cultures.
  Thus, the best answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: According to the passage, Dunham's work in anthropology differed from that of most other anthropologists in the 1930s in that Dunham
Choices:
  A: performed fieldwork for a very extended time period
  B: related the traditions she studied to those of her own culture

  She not only comprehended various dances as complex cultural practices, but also learned the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
  Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  But, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself.
  Therefore, Dunham employed a participative approach in performing research, which differed from that of most other anthropologists in the 1930s.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon

Response 2:
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A present the study by Solnick and Hemenway to explain the phenomenon of how people compare their social position to others to determine their level of happiness.
  The authors of Passage B mention the same study to provide evidence that material wealth is used to show not just prosperity, but success and the creation of value which brings happiness.
  The purposes for mentioning the study in each passage are different but related to explaining the role of wealth and success in happiness.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to identify why the authors of two different passages are mentioning the Solnick and Hemenway study.
  In passage A, the authors mention the study to show how relative prosperity contributes to happiness.
  In passage B, the Solnick and Hemenway study is cited to provide evidence for an explanation that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value.
  Therefore, the authors of passage A and passage B mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway respectively to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
  The answer is C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided.

The authors of Passage B discuss the theory regarding the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going, but this theory is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We need to understand why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway.
  The authors of passage A mention Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence that people compare their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income.
  The authors of passage B mention Solnick and Hemenway to refute the common belief that people care most about one-upmanship and to provide evidence that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they have created value.
  Therefore, passage A mentions the study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon, whereas passage B mentions the study to refute a common belief and to provide evidence for a different and more accurate explanation of the same phenomenon.
  The answer is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.
  B: It serves as the author's logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.
  C: It forms part of a speculative hypothesis that the author presents for its interest in relation to the main topic rather than as part of an argument.
  D: It serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.
  E: It forms part of the author's concession that certain factors complicate the argument presented in the first two paragraphs.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy
  D: conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives
  E: eagerness to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases

  The author shows skepticism about laypeople's intuitions as a general guide for deciding government risk-management policy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
   The author explains that laypeople determine the voluntariness of risk on the basis of whether the risk is incurred voluntarily.
   The author also suggests that the notion of voluntariness in relation to risk is not clear cut and may not be helpful in guiding policy decisions.
   As a result, the author says government policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors underlying judgments about voluntariness.
   This suggests the author is skeptical about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author discusses the belief that government intervention should depend on whether risk is voluntary or involuntary and suggests this distinction is often based on selective attention or disapproval of the purpose for the risk.
  The author concludes that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness and that government should attempt to save as many lives as possible.
  The author's attitude seems skeptical about relying solely on laypeople's emphasis on voluntariness and that better considerations should be identified for government risk management policy.
  The author does not seem to express chagrin, concern, conviction, or eagerness.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author believes that the demarcation line between voluntary and involuntary risk is the most important difference between lay and expert judgments.
  The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention and thus are of little use in guiding policy decisions.
  The author suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, and the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.

  Therefore, the best answer is C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
In the passage, the author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may not be useful in guiding policy decisions and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can subject to limited resources. The author also points out that judgments about whether a risk is “involuntary” often stem from confusion and selective attention. The author seems quite skeptical about the usefulness of the concept of voluntariness in guiding risk reduction policies and suggests that a better understanding of the factors is needed. 
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, the answer is C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
Response 6:
Thought: 
The author argues that there is no special character in notions like voluntary and involuntary and that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding.
The author suggests that departures from the principle should be justified not by invoking the voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk but, rather by identifying the more specific considerations.
Therefore, the author's attitude seems to be skeptical about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
Action: Answer("C")

Therefore, the author's attitude in the passage is skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
The author argues that attempts by laypeople to classify risks as voluntary or involuntary stem from confusion and selective attention and are not very useful in guiding policy decisions. Instead, the author believes that policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Thus, the author's attitude towards the issue is primarily critical of the notion that laypeople's intuitions about risk are sufficient guides for policy decisions and believes that a better approach is needed. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author presents an argument against relying on the dichotomy between voluntary and involuntary risk in guiding policy decisions.
  The author states the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is mainly used by laypeople and not experts in risk policy.
  The author suggests that judgments about the voluntariness of a risk stem from confusion and selective attention, and people may characterize risks as "voluntary" or "involuntary" based on whether they approve of the purpose for which people run the risks.
  The author concludes that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness and should attempt to save as many lives as it can.
  Thus, the author's attitude can be described as skeptical about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage mentions that some researchers fear that the patent holder may attempt to enjoin further research through legal action for patent infringement or refuse to make biological materials available unless a costly license is undertaken. However, the passage also mentio0ns that whether a patent would or could be enforced and bring a lawsuit against the researcher is a questionable matter, particularly on non-commercial research. Moreover, judges have tradition to respect a non-commercial research exception to patent infringement. Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts noncommercial research and is subsequently sued by the corporation.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage explains that academic researchers who fear biotechnology patents assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access, but that assumption is false.
  Whether or not a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher conducting basic research is unclear, and patent litigation is usually initiated only to protect a market position or an exclusive patent licensee.
  Moreover, there is a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Therefore, the author would predict that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  The answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that there is a tradition among judges to respect a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Therefore, conducting basic, noncommercial research involving patented cell lines would probably not be considered as patent infringement.
  Thus, option D is the most likely prediction.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage states that corporate patent holders may refuse to make materials available without a costly material transfer agreement. However, the passage also describes a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement that is usually respected by judges. Additionally, patents encourage innovation.
  Therefore, the researcher may be able to use the cell lines without infringement if the research is completely noncommercial and the researcher is not sued by the corporation.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that academic researchers fear corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. However, it is also suggested that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. 
  Courts have traditionally respected the completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement, so basic noncommercial research will mostly not be considered as patent infringement.
  Therefore, the researcher conducting basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")

  The answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that basic, noncommercial research is usually protected under a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  The passage also explains that researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
  However, the specific situation described in the question involves cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. 
  The passage indicates that in some cases, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken.
  However, it is unclear from the passage whether a for-profit biotechnology corporation would refuse a researcher who wishes to conduct basic noncommercial research involving their patented cell lines.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author argues that patenting biological materials will not necessarily result in the patent holder controlling access to the materials, especially for noncommercial research.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 0:
Thought:
 The passage states that the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but it hides the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. Therefore, the reasoning behind the subtractive method is plausible but produces a false impression of functional localization. The author does not suggest that the empirical results derived from the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications or that they provide a strong support for Uttal's view. The author also did not mention any evidence regarding specific brain structures, such as the amygdala, that supports or contradicts the modular theory of mind. Therefore, the most likely answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the subtractive method of brain scans and its relationship to the modular theory of mind.
  The author argues that the subtractive method is flawed because it masks the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, thereby creating an illusion of neat functional localization that supports the modular theory of mind.
  The author does not explicitly state agreement or disagreement with any of the choices.
  Choice B is consistent with the author's views, but the author does not state support for Uttal's view that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity.
  Choice C focuses on anger and the amygdala, which are not central to the author's argument.
  Choices A and E are not accurate descriptions of the author's argument.

Response 2:
Thought: 
The author discusses the subtractive method and its use in functional MRI.
The subtractive method is used to subtract the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
It produces striking images of the brain at work and purportedly supports the modular theory of mind by creating an illusion of a clean functional localization.
However, this method is criticized for obscuring the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
The author seems to hold the view that the subtractive method does not support the modular theory of mind, nor does it completely support Uttal's view that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity.
The author, therefore, does not appear to agree with any of the choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  The subtractive method is used to isolate the metabolic activity associated with a cognitive task.
  The author argues that the entire brain is active in both conditions, so the method obscures the fact that there are distributed brain functions.

  The author seems to be skeptical of the validity of empirical results derived using the subtractive method.
  The author argues that mental processes are distributed throughout the brain, so the subtractive method does not support the modular theory of mind.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
- The passage indicates that the subtractive method used in fMRI to create brain scans of individuals performing specific cognitive tasks creates an illusion that brain functions are localized that aligns with the modular theory of mind.
- However, the author criticizes the modular theory of mind and argues that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
- The author suggests that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and thus gives a false impression of neat functional localization.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage talks about Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) and how it is used to measure metabolic activity in different parts of the brain.
FMRI subtracts a baseline measurement from the onset measurement for a on-task cognitive activity and the residual represents metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
The passage also critiques the modular theory of mind, where the mind is broken down into independent modules, and argues for the idea that the entire brain is active in both emotional and cognitive activities.
Option A is not strongly supported by the passage because it suggests that "most cognition" depends on "independent modules". The author actually argues against this type of reductionism and the idea that "localizing" specific cognitive functions in discreet parts of the brain is too simplistic -- it "makes a hash of human experience."
Option B is not correct because the passage does not say that regions of the brain not engaged in a cognitive task have zero metabolic activity.
Option C aligns with the passage because it describes the mechanism of the subtractive method used in FMRI experiments. The passage discusses that the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active are depicted on an FMRI, and this is due to increased oxygen use.
Option D is wrong because it talks about baseline measurements that show "high metabolic activity at all times" which is different from what the passage explains (baseline measurements are taken before a cognitive task is carried out).
Option E may be tempting because it mentions anger, which is mentioned in the passage. However, the passage doesn't specifically support this statement, as it describes that emotional reactions and reasoning are not necessarily localized to specific regions of the brain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage discusses brain scans and how they are used in different contexts.
The modular theory of mind proposes that the mind can be separated into modules that correspond to localized brain regions.
William Uttal criticizes the modular theory of mind, arguing that mental processes are likely to be distributed throughout the brain.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a subtraction method that measures the difference in the rate of oxygen use between a baseline and an on-task condition to identify the brain areas involved in a specific cognitive activity.
The method used in FMRI contrasts with the idea that brain regions not involved in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use close to zero.
From this, it can be concluded that:
A: is not supported by the passage because it argues that the mental activity may not be separable into independent modules located in specific regions.
B: is not supported by the passage because it argues that brain regions not involved in some cognitive tasks are indeed active.
C: is supported by the passage as it states that regions of the brain involved in specific cognitive tasks have a higher rate of oxygen use.
D: is not supported by the passage because it does not describe the baseline measurements of oxygen use.
E: is not supported by the passage because it does not mention anger in particular.
Thus, the answer is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage describes a critique of the modular theory of mind and its relationship to brain scans that use the subtractive method. The passage explains that the entire brain is active in both conditions and that the subtractive method obscures this fact, making the functional localization of modular theory overly simplistic. The passage also describes that brain scans reveal areas of the brain that "light up" during cognitive tasks, but that the use of the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, the answer is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Response 3:
Thought: 
The passage distinguishes between the use of brain scans in diagnosis and their use as a research method.
The use of brain scans as a research method depends on the premise that mental processes can be analyzed into independent modules.
The criticism of the premise is that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity distributed throughout the brain.
FMRI produces images of metabolic activity associated solely with a cognitive task. 
One problem is that the method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
- The passage talks about the use of brain scans and the modular theory of mind.
- The modular theory of mind claims that modular and distinct parts of the brain are responsible for different mental activities.
- However, the essay argues that this theory of mind may not be accurate, and instead, the brain may be more general and interconnected as a system.
- It also explains that the subtractive method of measuring brain activity through scans obscures the fact that the brain is active in all functions, not just the cognitive tasks being examined.
- Therefore, the passage strongly supports statement C, which explains that during certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most used will display more metabolic activity, as shown through the subtractive method. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and the method of brain scans in psychology research. According to the passage:
- The validity of neuroimaging in psychology research depends on the modular theory of mind, which assumes that the mind can be analyzed into distinct modules represented in localized brain regions.
- However, this theory may not be valid because various mental processes are likely properties of a more general mental activity distributed throughout the brain.
- Brain scans reveal specific regions that are highly metabolically active in response to certain cognitive tasks, but these scans are obtained using the subtractive method, which obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control and cognitive task conditions.
- Therefore, it is unclear whether or not most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
	The passage explains that the modular theory of mind is questioned by the idea that mental activity may be distributed throughout the brain rather than being decomposable into independent modules.
	The passage discusses the functionality of brain scans, where different areas of the brain “light up” to different degrees during the performance of certain cognitive tasks.
	The brain scan method used is the subtractive method, which means the metabolic activity during task performance is obtained by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
	The passage opposes the notion that the entire brain is not at work during cognitive tasks.
	Option A contradicts the premise of the question.
	Option B contradicts what is stated regarding the brain’s functioning in the passage.
	Option D is also incorrect because it misinterprets the baseline measurements taken for use in the subtractive method.
	Option E contradicts the example used in the passage regarding cleanly separating anger and reason-giving, which makes human experience more complicated than that.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The passage explains that the mind cannot be analyzed into independent modules or components. FMRI scans are usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, but it is just a subtraction of baseline measurements from cognitive tasks measurements. The problem with the subtractive method is that it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. So, the statement that depicts this idea most strongly is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
The passage explains that brain scans used in medical diagnosis and psychology research are fundamentally different.
The passage argues against the idea that mental activity can be broken down into separate modules located in specific regions of the brain.
The passage explains how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) works to identify a specific cognitive task.
Therefore, the most strongly supported statement in the passage is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
- The passage mentions the modular theory of mind but also challenges it.
- Brain scans depict well-defined areas that "light up" in response to cognitive tasks due to a subtractive method. 
- The FMRI map shows the differential rate of oxygen use that stands as a measure of metabolic activity, and the severity of the use is a result of a subtraction between baseline and on-task conditions. 
- The subtraction method provides false functional localization.
- Cognition depends on general mental activities distributed throughout the brain, and the mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity.
- The passage describes that the separatism of cognitive functions into independent modules is problematic, as the brain is active in all conditions.
- Choice C seems most consistent with what the passage highlights.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A highlights the court's view that fingerprint evidence has withstood the test of time, and that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification.
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." and there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match.
  They agree that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification.
  Although both passages critique certain aspects of how fingerprint evidence is used, they do not directly disagree with one another on any point.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B present differing views on the reliability of fingerprint identification evidence.
  Passage A asserts that fingerprint identification is reliable and has a low error rate.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for determining whether two prints match and that there is no agreed-on standard for declaring a match.
  Both passages discuss the training and testing requirements for fingerprint examiners.
  However, there is no disagreement between the two passages on whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable or whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match.
  The authors do not express differing views on the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
  Passage B argues that there has been little systematic study of the error rate of fingerprint identification, while Passage A asserts that fingerprint identification has a low error rate that has been established over time.
  The authors do not disagree on whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law, as both passages note that fingerprint identification has not attained that status.
  The relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification are discussed only in Passage B and do not involve a disagreement between the authors.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A asserts that while further testing and development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, fingerprint identification is a reliable form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. It also claims that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. It contends that the trial court was within its discretion to accept testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate.
  Passage B disagrees with A by stating that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match and no consensus exists about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. It claims that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, no one can decisively answer how likely it is that two partial prints from different people will match, and the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. It asserts that proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors have been criticized as lax, and a more rigorous test showed a 34% rate of erroneous identification.
  The authors differ in their perspective on the reliability of fingerprint identification, the extent of studies that have been conducted, and the consistency of the method of identification. They do not differ in whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable, the degree of correlation different agencies require for examiners to declare a match, or the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A indicates that experts have long concurred about the reliability of fingerprint identification and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review, while Passage B discusses the lack of consensus among experts on the standard for determining a match, and it also highlights the lack of systematic study on the error rate of fingerprint identification. 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B can disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification and the standard for determining a match as the two authors take a different stance on these issues.
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B do not show any disagreement over uniformity of training, different agencies' variation in correlation required for examiners to declare a match, and fingerprint identification as a scientific law.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate and experts have long concurred about its reliability.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards and that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Moreover, the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
  The authors would most likely disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification and the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used for a long time and is reliable. It also contends that there is a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification among fingerprint experts and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review.
  Passage B, in contrast, argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." It also asserts that there is no consensus around this matter and that no generally agreed-on standard exists for determining when to declare a match. Additionally, it claims that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, which is critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence.
  Based on the analysis above, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case. While Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate and has stood the test of time, Passage B claims that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, some exams have been criticized as lax, and some tests showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification evidence should not be outright rejected because it has been used for 100 years.
  Passage A acknowledges that there might be differences among agencies in terms of correlation required for identification, but argues that there are consistent points and characteristics approach to identification that is held among fingerprint examiners.
  Passage A argues that fingerprint examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements and standards have been established through professional training and peer review.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match and that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining when to declare a match.
  Passage B argues that error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
  Passage B provides a possible rate of erroneous identification as 34% based on a rigorous test.
 
Based on the thoughts above, the authors would be most likely to disagree about: 
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
  
Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  In Passage A, the author argues in favor of fingerprint identification for use in criminal trials, highlighting that experts have long concurred about its reliability and that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification.
  In Passage B, the author argues against the reliability of fingerprint identification, stating that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification and no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. 
  The authors disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification and its use in criminal trials.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses that experts have long concurred about the reliability of fingerprint identification. The passage states that "uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review" and that the trial court was within its discretion in accrediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate.
  
  Passage B, however, disagrees with the assertions in Passage A and claims that there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, and that no :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively.
  
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
  
  The answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A supports the use of fingerprint evidence in criminal trials and argues that while further improvements may be desirable, current standards are reliable and consistent.
  Passage B describes the lack of objective standards in fingerprint identification, criticizes the laxity of some proficiency tests and suggests a high error rate.
  The authors seem to disagree about the reliability and appropriateness of using fingerprint evidence as a standard in criminal trials.
  Passage A disagrees only with the defendant's claim that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards, arguing instead that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. This does not contradict what is said in Passage B, but suggests that uniform standards have been established more generally in the profession.
  Passage B, on the other hand, suggest that there is no way to judge the reliability of fingerprint evidence based on current standards.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the merit of using fingerprint identification as evidence in criminal trials.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings
Response 0:
Thought: 
The author discusses numerous factors that contribute to the success of stealing thunder.  
The passage suggests that stealing thunder may be successful because volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility.  
Another reason stealing thunder may work is because it provides jurors with an impetus for critical assessment by alerting them to testimony that the opposition plans to present. 
In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning.
Jurors are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case, and can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information.
Action: Answer("D") -> jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
Response 1:
Thought:
  According to the passage, various psychological explanations support the notion that stealing thunder is effective.
  One of these explanations is that volunteers of negative information appear more credible and persuasive to an audience.
  Additionally, stealing thunder alerts juries to testimony that the opposition plans to present, giving jurors an impetus for critical assessment.
  This, in turn, can make jurors more resistant to persuasive attempts and cause them to form counterarguments.
  Based on this information,
Action: Answer("D") jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about the discovery of a new class of protein pathogen called prions.
  Prions cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a deadly degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  Prions can reproduce without genetic material and cause a chain reaction that produces a plaque that destroys nerve cells in the brain.
  The discovery of prions initiated skepticism at first but was later accepted by the scientific community as a new class of infectious pathogens.
  The passage also mentions that protein malformation may be involved in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
  The main point of the passage is that prions are a new class of infectious pathogens that cause CJD and have the ability to reproduce themselves without genetic material.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that individuals may not be fully responsible for their actions since their choices stem from emotional centers in their brain.
  Passage B introduces the concept of "soft determinism".
  Soft determinism is the idea that actions are free if they arise from internal sources rather than external sources or disorders.
  Ayer argues that the existence of a cause is not that important, but rather the source of that cause is what determines free actions.
  Mental disorder is mentioned as an example of an external source that could lead to constrained actions.
Answer: A: mental disorder
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that individuals may not have free and rational moral choice as their brain activity may be in emotional centers of the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem-solving.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism. It distinguishes between free actions (caused by internal sources, by one's own will) and constrained actions (caused by external sources). Ayer argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. 
  Mental disorder is discussed in passage B as an example of a condition that can cause constrained actions.
  Free choice is the concept addressed in Passage B.
  Causality is addressed in both passages.
  Self-delusion and moral responsibility are addressed in passage A.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument in Passage A suggests that the way we think about the law should change because people may not be making free and rational choices due to their brain's activity.
  The argument in Passage B discusses the view that free will can coexist with determinism.
  The distinction between free actions and constrained actions is introduced in Passage B but not mentioned in Passage A.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses the idea that behavior is caused by brain operations.
  It suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  It discusses how people may be deluded about their free and rational moral choices.
  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism, which supports the idea of free choice.
  Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" discusses the concept of free actions and constrained actions.
  Passage B discusses the source of the cause of an action to determine free will.
  Mental disorder is mentioned in Passage B but not directly related to the argument.
  Choice A is not the answer
  Free choice is mentioned in both passages. 
  Causality is related to the argument of both passages.
  Self-delusion is mentioned in Passage A but not the answer. 
  Moral responsibility is mentioned in Passage A but not the answer.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that criminal law should focus on deterring future harm, rather than punishing bad people.
  Passage A suggests that people may be deluded about their free and rational moral choice.
  Passage A claims that whether someone is rational depends on their brain.
  Passage B argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Passage B claims that a disease-free brain can still act freely.
  The role of mental disorder is emphasized in Passage B and not in Passage A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses the idea that the operations of the brain influence behavior and decision-making, which challenges the concept of moral responsibility. 
  Passage B discusses determinism and Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" which suggests that individuals can still act freely in a deterministic world.
  The concept of free choice plays a central role in the argument of passage B, but is not explicitly discussed in passage A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that free and rational moral choice may be an illusion, and the legal system should focus on deterrence.
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that determinism and free will can coexist and proposes the theory of "soft determinism." 
  Ayer's theory distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions, not mentioned in passage A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses the radical change in the law using recent findings in neuroscience,
  people who are supposedly making free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves.
  The implication is that moral responsibility is weakened or non-existent.
  Passage B argues that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely, if the action is not constrained.
  Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions based on their source of the cause.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: According to the passage, which one of the following was true of the physics community during the 1930s?
Choices:
  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: It reevaluated caleulations indicating that atoms could be split
  C: It never identified the by-products ofneutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  D: It showed that uraniwn atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: It recogoized the daogers of working with radioactive substances.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes scientific discoveries related to nuclear fission.
  The scientists previously had some theoretical calculations that atoms can be split.
  But they did not recognize this possibility in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that led to the realization that they were actually splitting uranium atoms.
  Therefore, the physics community neglected the earlier theoretical development and did not recognize the possibility of splitting atoms from neutron-bombardment experiments.
  The answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  During the 1930s, the discovery of nuclear fission was being made.
  There were theoretical developments that were pointing towards the possibility of nuclear fission, but they were not being focused on at the time of discovery.
  The discovery was being made through the neutron-bombardment experiments.
  Scientists were unaware of what they were really witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection for the discovery.
  Otto Hahn discovered that one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, which Meitner recognized as the splitting of uranium atoms and coined the term "nuclear fission".
  This finding was corroborated by scientists in Europe and North America.
  Therefore, the physics community during the 1930s was neglecting the earlier theoretical developments about the possibility of nuclear fission and was not fully receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission could be achieved through the neutron-bombardment experiments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The physicists' experiments produced by-products that could not be identified easily.
  Lise Meitner provided the theoretical explanation for nuclear fission.
  The experiments were not intentionally aimed at splitting atoms.
  Therefore, the correct answer choice will reflect an accurate characterization of the physics community's attitude and response to nuclear fission experiments.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage describes the history of nuclear fission experiments leading up to Lise Meitner's discovery of nuclear splitting.
  The physicists' experiments involved neutron bombardment of uranium.
  These experiments produced radioactive substances that the scientists at the time did not fully understand.
  Meitner recognized that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  The nuclear fission discovery made by Meitner was not immediately accepted due to a lack of conceptual understanding.
  Therefore, the passage does not indicate that the physics community during the 1930s reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
  The answer is not B.
Action: Answer("B")  # (Incorrect)
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage describes scientists failing to recognize what they were witnessing with nuclear fission.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
  This discovery was made between 1934 and 1939.
  Researchers were not receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission.
  Theoretical physicists had previously produced calculations indicating that in principle, it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The Berlin researchers discovered radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  These substances remained unidentified because they were expected to be similar to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Later, one of the substances was conclusively identified as barium.
  Meitner realized that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  Answer: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission from 1934 to 1939. 
  Scientists at the time did not recognize that they were witnessing the phenomenon of nuclear fission.
  Meitner made the crucial theoretical connection that it was uranium atoms that were being split.
  Therefore, we can conclude that the physics community during the 1930s did not recognize that they were witnessing nuclear fission.
  The answer is B: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage describes that theoretical physicists produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, but those were not related to neutron-bombardment experiments.
  During the period between 1934 and 1939, scientists, including Enrico Fermi, conducted neutron-bombardment experiments to compile increasingly strong evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved. However, they did not recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided a theoretical connection.
  Scientists were not receptive to the possibility that the neutron-bombardment experiments would break atoms apart.
  The minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials hampered precise chemical analyses, resulting in unidentified products.
  It was Meitner who finally recognized that splitting uranium atoms had been achieved. She coined the term "nuclear fission."
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage gives a detailed account of the research on the nuclear fission of uranium.
  The community of physicists, including Fermi and Meitner, conducted neutron-bombardment experiments in order to identify the by-products of uranium atoms.
  Despite several findings, they failed to identify that nuclear fission had taken place.
  Lise Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations and proposed the concept of nuclear fission.
  No information is given on the community's attitude toward earlier theoretical developments, the reevaluation of calculations, the identification of by-products, the easiest atoms to split, or the dangers of working with radioactive substances.
  Therefore, choice A, B, C, D, and E are all incorrect.
Action: Answer("None")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage says that earlier theoretical physicists had already produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart, implying that these developments were not neglected.
  Additionally, the passage describes how scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939, without recognizing exactly what they were witnessing. 
  It also explains that the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium were produced, but for a while, they went unidentified. 
  While uranium was the element that scientists were experimenting with, the passage does not say it was the easiest to split, making D incorrect.
  Lastly, while it mentions the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, it does not imply that the physics community recognized these dangers.
  Overall, the only answer that is true and supported by the passage is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes that some theoretical physicists were already aware that atomic nuclei could be split before the neutron and proton composition of the nucleus had been experimentally demonstrated. However, scientists who conducted research to split uranium atoms did not expect that to happen. As a result of this unexpected finding, there was a lack of understanding of the significance of the by-products produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. But, in 1939, Lise Meitner provided the necessary theoretical connection and recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations - that the researchers had successfully split uranium atoms.
  
  Therefore, none of the answer choices are exactly correct. The closest option would be A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments. However, this is not true for all physicists in the community, as the passage states that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating the possibility of splitting atoms before the experiments with uranium atoms.

A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Which one of the following is most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" (line 62)?
Choices:
  A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939
  B: the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938
  C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium
  D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus
  E: the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long
Response 0:
Thought: 
The passage discusses how a crucial hypothesis was long overlooked despite the increasing evidence compiled by scientists that nuclear fission had been achieved.
Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, which led to the discovery that Uranium atoms had been split.
Therefore, "the relevant evidence" referred to in line 62 is the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The author uses the phrase "the relevant evidence" to refer to the evidence that was present but lacked the right conceptual link. 
From the passage, we know that the relevant evidence related to the fact that the researchers were actually splitting uranium atoms. 
The chemical evidence that led to the recognition of the significance of atomic fission is mentioned - one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. 
Therefore, the most nearly equivalent to "the relevant evidence" is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author explains that the relevant evidence had been present for some time but it was lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
  The discovery that uranium atoms were being split was made based on the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  The clear chemical evidence of barium being produced was the result that prompted scientists to acknowledge the discovery made.
  The fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus provided proof of the discovery.
  The fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long is not important to the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission. 
  Therefore, the evidence being referred to by the author is the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found that barium was produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author explains that relevant evidence indicating the possibility of splitting atoms was present but not recognized.
  According to the passage, Meitner recognized the significance of the data.
  Meitner co-authored a paper and submitted her conclusion for publication.
  Scientists outside Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, which suggests that evidence in support of nuclear fission already existed.
  The answer must refer to evidence indicating the possibility of splitting uranium atoms.
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 4:
Thought:
  "The relevant evidence" in line 62 refers to the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  According to the passage, Meitner provided the theoretical connection needed to understand the occurrence of nuclear fission that scientists had observed.
  The passage also states that Hahn discovered clear chemical evidence of barium being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  It was Meitner who recognized the significance of Hahn's data.
  Therefore, the answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The relevant evidence led to the recognition that nuclear fission was occurring.
  The experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium helped researchers compile evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Meitner discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Hahn identified one of the substances as barium, but given its structure, it was impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments.
  The number of protons and neutrons in barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number for a uranium nucleus.
  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence refers to the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted between 1934 and 1939, which led to the recognition of nuclear fission, as described in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
The relevant evidence refers to the evidence that was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
According to the context, Meitner's discovery was the right conceptual link.
Hence, it can be inferred that the relevant evidence must be linked to Meitner's discovery. 
The clear chemical evidence of barium’s being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium was linked to Meitner’s discovery. 
Therefore, the answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question refers to the relevant evidence mentioned in line 62.
  According to the passage, Meitner discovered that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  The relevant evidence implies the evidence that led to Meitner's realizing that researchers had been splitting uranium atoms.
  This evidence is the same one Hahn found, which was that barium was being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Therefore, the answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
In the sentence, "When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link" (lines 61-64), the phrase "the relevant evidence" refers to the evidence that led scientists to realize that they had actually been splitting uranium atoms. This evidence was the identification of barium as a product of the neutron bombardment of uranium. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author talks about the evidence which had been present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The author mentions that Meitner discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Lichtenstein's work as having a complexity that goes beyond parody.
  Lichtenstein's work reflected his culture and used comic-book art conventions.
  The author describes Lichtenstein as having a faith in reconciliation and displays a kind of deliberate naivete.
  Answer A doesn't go against the author's characterization of Lichtenstein but rather suggests that he still maintained an interest in abstract expressionism.
  Answer B, on the other hand, suggests that Lichtenstein recognizes that an abstract expressionist painter could effectively convey emotions using nonrepresentational techniques, thus contradicting the idea that Lichenstein's work was necessary to counter an excess of sophistication in abstract expressionism.
  Answer C doesn't go against the author's characterization of Lichtenstein but rather suggests that Lichtenstein has respect for some early abstract expressionist painters.
  Answer D is not correct because the passage does not describe Lichtenstein as criticizing other pop artists for producing emotional paintings.
  Answer E is not correct because the passage doesn't describe Lichtenstein as criticizing other pop artists for producing paintings void of emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as both a parody and a realism depiction of contemporary life.
  The author mentions that Lichtenstein wasn't rebelling against the early abstract expressionist work, which means Lichtenstein had some regard and respect for it.
  Looking at the answer choices, option A talks about Lichtenstein attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters which doesn't directly challenge the characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Option B and C talk about Lichtenstein praising abstract expressionist painters, which also doesn't directly challenge the characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Option D talks about Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist for producing emotionally driven paintings, which also doesn't challenge the characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Option E is the only option that talks about criticism towards paintings void of emotion. However, this contradicts the author's depiction of Lichtenstein's work having an inner sweetness beneath its surface bravado.
  Therefore, option E would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Roy Lichtenstein's work as a merger of popular culture with the forms and intentions of fine art, resulting in a complex work that conveys a serious theme transcending parody.
  The author points out that Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism; but while some pop art reflected a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, Lichtenstein's displayed instead a deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in some other pop artists.
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  If any choice contradicts the author's claims about Lichtenstein's merger of popular and fine art and the serious themes that it conveys, it would contradict the author's characterization.
  Choice (A) is not necessarily a challenge, because Lichtenstein attending exhibitions does not contradict the characteristics mentioned by the author. 
  Choice (B) actually reinforces the author's characterization by pointing to an atypical emotional painting.
  Choice (C) could be supportive for Roy Lichtenstein because he struggled against the declining emotional power of Abstract Expressionism.
  Choice (D) actually reaffirms the viewpoint the author expressed regarding Roy Lichtenstein's work being a deliberate naivete, unlike other pop artists who produced emotional art.
  Choice (E) is the closest options to challenge the author as it if Roy Lichtenstein criticized artists for producing void of emotional paintings, this contradicts the author's argument that his work was an attempt at merging popular culture with the forms and intentions of fine arts.
  Based on the above analysis, the answer is E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a complex and deliberate mix of popular culture and fine art, conveying a seriousness of theme while poking fun at pretensions of the art world, and displaying an impulse toward realism.
  The author notes that Lichtenstein was rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than ignoring it, and that his work exuded a kind of deliberate naivete that was a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in some other pop artists.
  To challenge this characterization, we need to find an option that contradicts one or more of these statements.
  Options A, B, D, and E are related to Lichtenstein's opinions about other artists and are not directly related to the characterization provided by the author.
  Option C states that Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist (thus, not a later, faded one), but this does not necessarily contradict the characterization provided by the author.
  Therefore, none of the options would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
The central idea of the passage is to explain Lichtenstein's work and what it represents. The author describes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of popular genre with fine art that generated a complex result, conveyed a seriousness of theme that transcended mere parody, and depicted contemporary life. The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as an urge towards realism and reconciliation and mentions that his work exuded a deliberate naivete intended as a response to the excess of sophistication that he observed in some other pop artists. 
Choice (A) relates to whether Lichtenstein attended exhibitions by abstract expressionists in the 1960s and does not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
Choice (B) states that Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting. This would support the idea that emotional paintings were present in the 1960s and contradict the author's statement where they say abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force by the time pop art emerged in the 1960s. Hence, (B) could challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
Choice (C) says that Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings which might suggest that Abstract Expressionism had continuities, and so challenge the author's idea of an older and newer generation of abstract expressionists. Hence, (C) could challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
Choice (D) states that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist, which is not relevant to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
Choice (E) says that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion. This statement is not relevant to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
Actions: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes Lichtenstein as creating a unique art form that imitates comic books and commercial art, but is in fact intended to convey contemporary life.
  The author of the passage emphasizes that Lichtenstein's work was not aloof but was instead a reaction against the excess of sophistication in some other pop artists and later abstract expressionists.
  To challenge this characterization, an answer choice would need to provide evidence that Lichtenstein was aloof in his approach or was more interested in superficial parody than actual commentary on contemporary life.
  Answer choice A does not provide evidence that challenges the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. It's possible for Lichtenstein to attend exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters while still critiquing or reacting against their work.
  Answer choice B suggests that Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting. However, this does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as a painter who tried to depict contemporary life through a unique blend of comic book and commercial art styles.
  Answer choice C suggests that Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings. But this is again neutral and does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization.
  Answer choice D suggests that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings. This again does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer choice E suggests that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion. This choice actually supports the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, since it suggests that he was interested in conveying true emotion through his work rather than completely abandoning it as some other pop artists may have done.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have.
  Instead, insider trading laws should only prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Passage B argues that insider trading laws should prohibit trading on any insider information because it unfairly gives some people an advantage over others.
  The question asks for a law that conforms most closely to the position in passage A but not in passage B.
  Therefore, the best answer choice is a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is the position articulated in passage A.
  The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that spreading relevant information about a company and allowing those with accurate knowledge about changing circumstances to act is good for everyone in the stock market.
  Passage A argues that individuals aren't criminals if they sell or buy a stock based on knowledge that many others don't have.
  Passage B argues that insider trading compromises the market's transparency by giving people with inside information an unfair advantage over other investors, which could ultimately undermine investor confidence and destroy the market.
  The question asks us to identify a law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
  A law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company seems to align with passage A's position but not passage B's.
  Hence, the Answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading is not always problematic since it can help disseminate valuable information and can lead to more accurate stock prices. 
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the stock market and can negatively affect investors' confidence in the market.
  A law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of Passage A but not Passage B would be one that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Such a law would allow for the benefits of insider trading to spread valuable information and increase the accuracy of stock prices. Simultaneously, it would ensure a level playing field for all investors and minimize the unfair advantages that insiders can have.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock, but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author of Passage A argues that there is a distinction between insider-trading and insider nontrading. The author believes that the insider nontrading is vital to the functioning of the stock market. The author believes in the principle that all relevant information about a company should spread as widely as possible and as quickly as possible.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence in the stock market and denies companies access to funds needed to grow and be successful.
  The author of Passage A does not support insider trading.
  The author of Passage A believes that transparency is essential so that a functioning stock market can occur.
  Choice A does not conform to the position articulated by the author of Passage A.
  Choice B, Choice C, and Choice D contain some aspects mentioned by the author of Passage A.
  Choice E legalizes trading based on inside information, which does not conform to the position articulated by the author of Passage A.
  The best answer is B - a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This option takes into account the distinction between insider-trading and non-insider trading and supports transparency. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading can sometimes benefit the stock market.
  It argues that when someone sells a stock because they know the price will soon drop, it helps spread the knowledge that the price should drop and, thus, helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider trading is bad for the stock market.
  It argues that insider trading violates the basic principle of the stock market, which is transparency, and undermines investor confidence, which may ultimately lead to the destruction of the market.
  In light of these arguments, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of Passage A but not that articulated by the author of Passage B is a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Answer: B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues in favor of the use of information not available to the public to influence stock trading.
  The author argues that this is not unfair, pointing out that insider nontrading is a similar phenomenon that is not criticized.
  The author believes that stock prices reflecting accurate information is good for everyone in the stock market.
  Passage B argues in favor of a transparent market in which everyone has the same access to information.
  The author argues that insider trading compromises the market by giving some people an unfair advantage over others, damaging investor confidence and ultimately causing widespread financial damage.
  Answer choice B is close to Passage A, but it permits trading on internal analysis.
  Answer choice C focuses on the prohibition of actions that would undermine investor confidence.
  The author of passage B would likely support this proposed law because undermining investor confidence is seen as a consequence of insider trading.
  Choice D is narrower than what Passage A endorses; it only permits selling stocks based on inside information.
  Answer choice E goes against both passages' arguments.
  Therefore, the answer is A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  According to passage A, insider-trading law should allow people to act on accurate information about company values that others don't have.
  According to passage B, insider-trading law should prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by all.
  Therefore, a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by all would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage B but not that articulated by the author of passage A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that trading based on knowledge not shared by everyone should not be illegal, as it is a natural part of the stock market.
  Passage A is in favor of allowing individuals to act on accurate information about changing circumstances so that stock prices reflect them.
  However, passage B argues that insider trading unfairly compromises the market, giving individuals with inside information an unfair advantage, which ultimately undermined investor confidence in the market.
  The author of passage A does not support insider trading, but rather believes that the law should permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock and not information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Choice A prohibits trading based on information not shared by everyone, whereas the author of passage A is in favor of allowing individuals to act on accurate information about changing circumstances so that stock prices reflect them.
  Choice B aligns most closely with the position articulated by the author of passage A but not the author of passage B. The author of passage A suggests that trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock should be permitted, while prohibiting trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, whereas the author of passage B is opposed to insider trading altogether.
  Choices C, D, and E are not in line with the position articulated by the author of passage A.
 Answer: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should not prohibit individuals from making informed trades based on non-public information.
  Passage B argues that insider trading laws should prohibit informed trades based on non-public information as it undermines transparency and investor confidence.
  A law that conforms to the position of passage A but not passage B would be one that permits some but not all insider trading.
  Choice B, a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, is consistent with passage A but not with passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author of passage A argues that the functioning of the stock market relies on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients.
  The author of passage A believes that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  However, the author of passage B believes that insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. That unfairly compromises the market.
  The position articulated by the author of passage A, but not by the author of passage B, would permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Answer: B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  CJD is caused by a pathogen called prion.
  Prions lack nucleic acid and reproduce by inducing normally shaped prions to turn into abnormal shape one after another.
  Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins.
  Prions cause CJD by producing a plaque that destroys nerve cells in the brain.
  The discovery of Prions was initially received with great skepticism but subsequent research has supported its conclusion as an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.
  Other diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may be caused by a similar process of protein malformation.
  From the given choices, option C is the most strongly supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes a new type of pathogen called prions.
  Prions lacking nucleic acid are responsible for causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.
  Prions have the ability to reproduce themselves without any other agents, by inducing normal prions to transform on contact.
  Prions lead to the destruction of nerve cells, and cause diseases that are inevitably fatal.
  The passage does not support choice A as the prion pathogen can be transmitted through various means, including ingestion and inheritance.
  Choice B is opposite to what the passage describes.
  Choice C is supported by the passage.
  Choice D is not supported by the passage.
  The passage does not give enough information to support choice E.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  - The passage discusses the discovery of prions and their link to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  - Prions are a type of protein pathogen that reproduce themselves and cause neurological damage leading to death.
  - The body does not produce an immune response against prions as they are natural proteins in the body.
  - There is currently no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal.
  - Other conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may also involve a similar process of protein malformation.
  - The question is asking for the answer most strongly supported by the passage. 
  - Answer A is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that transmission can only occur through injection.
  - Answer B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that most infectious diseases are caused by prions.
  - Answer C is correct because the passage states that the pathogenic capability of prions results from their self-reproducing abilities.
  - Answer D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that prion diseases are the same as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.
  - Answer E is incorrect because the passage does not make any comparison between prion diseases and diseases caused by other pathogens regarding aggressiveness.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about prions, their properties, and how they cause CJD.
  Prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  The cascade process by which prions reproduce themselves is lethal and CJD is unavoidably fatal.
  The exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
  Choice A is wrong since the passage mentions nothing about the transmission of CJD.
  Choice B is wrong since it says most infectious diseases are thought to be caused by prions. The passage only mentions Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.
  Choice C is correct since the passage says that prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction. Without the ability to reproduce themselves, abnormal prions would not cause CJD.
  Choice D is wrong since the passage mentions nothing about Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease being caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  Choice E is wrong since the passage mentions nothing about prion diseases generally progressing more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of pathogen known as a prion.
  Prions lack nucleic acid and are made up of protein.
  The prions responsible for CJD are able to reproduce and cause nerve cells in the brain to become destroyed.
  The body does not produce an immune response to prions.
  More research must be done to fully understand how prions work.
  Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not state this.
  Choice B is incorrect because the passage states that previously known infectious diseases are caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Prions are a new class of infectious pathogens.
  Choice C is supported because the passage states that prions need to be able to reproduce themselves to cause CJD.
  Choice D is incorrect because the passage states that the possibility of a link between Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease to prions exists but has not been fully explored yet.
  Choice E is incorrect because the passage states that there are wide variations in incubation times and aggressiveness of prion diseases.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
	The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) which is caused by prions.
	CJD can be transmitted through contact with abnormally shaped prions.
	Abnormally shaped prions reproduce themselves and cause the cellular destruction that leads to CJD.
	Research supports the conclusion that prion is an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.
	The passage does not discuss other infectious diseases or pathogens.
	Although the passage mentions that protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions, this possibility has yet to be fully explored.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions as a new type of protein-based pathogen, which is known to cause Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD).
  Prions convert their structures into an abnormal and pathogenic shape, which is infectious and capable of reproducing themselves.
  Unlike other pathogens, prions occur naturally in the body as proteins and do not trigger an immune response.
  The cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves is believed to be responsible for the cellular destruction that leads to CJD.
  The passage does not state that transmission occurs only through the injection of abnormally shaped prions or that most infectious diseases are caused by prions.
  There is no evidence that Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) caused by a prion.
  Prion is a disease agent consisting mainly of protein and lacking nucleic acid.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins but can initiate a chain reaction that transforms normal prions into pathogenic ones.
  The transformed prions can reproduce themselves, initiating another chain reaction.
  The pathogenic prions collect in the brain and ultimately destroy nerve cells, leading to CJD, which is inevitably fatal.
  The passage suggests that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens and may also be involved in other conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
  Based on these statements, the most strongly supported choice is C because the passage clearly states that pathogenic prions are capable of reproducing themselves and causing CJD. Answer(C)
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage describes the discovery of prions as a new class of infectious pathogens that cause CJD and may be involved in other neurological conditions.
  The passage also explains that prions possess the ability to reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses CJD, a disease caused by an infectious agent called "prion."
  Prion is a new type of pathogen that primarily consists of protein and lacks nucleic acid. 
  Prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction, induce normally shaped prions to transform themselves into abnormal, pathogenic conformation, and produce pathogenic plaques.
  Unlike other pathogens, the body does not produce an immune response when prions are present.
  It is possible that a similar protein malformation process is involved in other degenerative neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
  The exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be entirely understood.
  Therefore, Option A, B, D, and E are incorrect. 
  Option C is correct because the passage states that abnormally shaped prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses a contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory's increasing returns to scale and the Invisible Hand's preference for competition.
  A key argument of the passage is that before the late 1970s, economists could not rigorously model increasing returns to scale.
  The passage suggests that economics sought to create mathematical models of their ideas.
  The passage discusses the reasons why Warsh's book puts so much emphasis on the Pin Factory.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage is about the contradiction inherent in economic theory since Adam Smith published "The Wealth of Nations."
  Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size, and he recognized how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good.
  The two concepts, however, are opposed to each other, and this creates a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  Only since the late 1970s has the Pin Factory surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the notion of decreasing returns to scale was the accepted view among economists for almost two centuries, but recent developments in mathematics have enabled the recognition that many enterprises, such as railroads, exhibit increasing returns to scale, and thus the Pin Factory has now surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought.
  The answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage mainly talks about two economic theories, i.e. Pin Factory and Invisible Hand.
  Pin Factory says that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business because of increasing returns to scale which creates a natural tendency toward monopoly. Thus, it can be assumed that free markets always get it right by assuming returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  The functioning of the Invisible Hand is based on the idea that self-interest can lead to the common good through competition in the marketplace.
  The passage explains the progression of the acceptance of these two concepts in economic thought over time.
  Option B best summarizes the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage discusses the contradiction between two economic concepts: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
The Pin Factory concept argues for increasing returns to scale, but that creates a tendency toward monopoly and can drive smaller firms out of business.
The Invisible Hand concept argues for the harnessing of self-interest to serve the common good, but that does not work properly if there is monopoly power.
Mainstream economics have always chosen to emphasize the Diminishing Returns concept over the Pin Factory concept in part because it can be described more rigorously with mathematics.
Only recently have mathematicians developed better ways of describing the Pin Factory concept with mathematical rigor.
The main point of the passage is the discussion of the contradiction between two economic concepts and the role of mathematics in describing them.
The best answer is therefore B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction inherent in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes increasing returns to scale but could lead to monopoly power.
  The Invisible Hand assumes diminishing returns and requires a competitive market.
  The Pin Factory theory was not embraced earlier due to the difficulty of representing it mathematically.
  Recently, increasing returns to scale have become more accepted in economic thought.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
The passage discusses two main economic concepts: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
These two concepts are opposed to each other because of the contradiction between increasing returns to scale (the Pin Factory) and the requirement of many competitors for the invisible hand to work.
The assumption of diminishing returns has dominated economic theory until recently; however, since the late 1970s, increasing returns have surfaced in mainstream economic thought.
The main point of the passage explains the relationship between these two concepts and the development of economic theory around them.
Therefore, the answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The article discusses the contradiction inherent between the Pin factory and the Invisible Hand concepts.
  The Pin factory promotes increased returns to scale, leading to a tendency towards monopoly, whereas the invisible hand needs many competitors to work properly.
  The diminishing returns concept is better suited for mathematical models than the increasing returns concept.
  Increased returns have been a topic of discussion among economists for centuries.
  Recent mathematical developments contributed to recognizing the Pin Factory as an important element in economics.
  The main point of the article is that economists' attention to increased returns to scale in the economy has increased only in recent times.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and how this contradiction affects economic theory.
  The Pin Factory represents increasing returns to scale and the tendency toward monopoly, while the Invisible Hand represents the harnessing of self-interest to the common good in a competitive market with many competitors.
  To make increasing returns respectable, economists needed to find a way to describe it with mathematical rigor, which proved difficult for a long time.
  The Invisible Hand relies on diminishing returns for optimal outcomes and many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly.
  The passage does not suggest that mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are increasing.
  The passage does not suggest that recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  The passage does not focus solely on Adam Smith's contribution, but rather the history of economic thought surrounding the Pin Factory and increasing returns.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the contradiction between two concepts in economic theory -the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  "For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized." This implies that recently the theory has changed.
  "Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river"-a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought." This supports the previous statement.
  The latter half of the passage describes how recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled rigorously.
  Therefore, the most accurate choice is E: Economists have until somewhat recently failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses a contradiction in economic theory, specifically with regards to the concepts of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the efficiency benefits of increasing returns to scale, but this can lead to monopolies and a lack of competition.
  On the other hand, the Invisible Hand relies on a competitive market with many participants to ensure that self-interest aligns with the common good.
  The assumption of diminishing returns has dominated economic theory and is easier to represent mathematically, but increasing returns are becoming more widely recognized through rigorous modeling.
  The main point is that there has been a struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory, and recent developments have enabled more rigorous modeling of the Pin Factory along with a recognition of the importance of increasing returns.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the Great Migration, which occurred between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by three key factors, including a boll weevil infestation reducing labor demand in the South and World War I increasing labor demand in the North.
  Once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration.
  Previous migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants and provided a cultural and linguistic cushion for them.
  The author focuses on explaining why migration continued and accelerated for decades despite narrowing income differences between the North and South.

Thought:
  The passage describes the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North from 1915 to 1960.
  The passage discusses the reasons that sparked the migration, such as increased labor demand in the North and reduced labor demand in the South caused by boll weevil infestation, but then highlights the role of returning migrants in reducing the costs of adapting to new surroundings for new migrants.
  The passage notes that information was passed through letters and conversation among migrants.
  Also, earlier migrants often provided temporary housing, credit, and a cultural cushion for new migrants.
  The passage suggests that momentum developed for migration over time.
  The main point of the passage is not about why the income gap between the North and the South existed, nor is it about why the Great Migration occurred.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading is important for more accurate stock prices.
  Passage B argues that insider trading creates an unfair advantage and undermines investor confidence.
  The authors of Passage A argue that it is appropriate to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis, but of information available to everyone.
  The authors of Passage B argue for transparency and equal information availability, suggesting that insider nontrading doesn't deserve punishment.
  Both passages agree that investor confidence in the market is important.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would most likely agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A states that insider-trading laws make it illegal to make transactions based on information obtained ahead of the general public.
  However, it also highlights that the stock market works best when all relevant information is disseminated widely.
  Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. 
  Passage B highlights that transparency is critical for a fair and proper stock market.
  In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have, unfairly compromising the market hence undermining investor confidence.
  Therefore, both authors would most likely agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  In Passage A, the author argues that trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have is part of a functioning stock market, and that insider nontrading is a widespread practice that happens every day and shouldn't be criminalized.
  In Passage B, the author argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market, and insider-trading situations compromise the market by giving certain people an unfair advantage.
  Both authors seem to agree that transparency is important in the stock market.
  However, Passage A argues that insider-trading law shouldn't criminalize trading based on superior stock analysis, while Passage B argues that insider-trading law is necessary to prevent unfair advantages and to maintain investor confidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that insider trading law may hinder transparency and the efficient functioning of the stock market.
  Passage B argues that transparency is critical to investor confidence and the long-term success of the stock market.
  However, both passages recognize that insider trading gives an unfair advantage to some investors and undermines the equal access to information that a transparent market aims to provide.
  Based on this analysis, the authors would most likely agree that insider trading undermines investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading can help ensure that stock prices reflect more accurate assessments of a company's value.
  Passage B argues that insider trading can undermine investor confidence and ultimately destroy the market.
  Passage A suggests that insider nontrading is a common and acceptable practice that is analogous to insider trading.
  Passage B implies that transparency is essential for a functioning stock market.
  The authors of both passages are likely to agree that transparency is important for investor confidence.
  Therefore, the answer is B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading law should be reconsidered and that insider trading can even be good for the stock market.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the principle of transparency, which damages the stock market as a whole.
  The authors of Passage A would disagree with the view expressed in Passage B.
  Passage A indicates that insider nontrading is acceptable even though it involves using insider knowledge that other traders do not have.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A would most likely agree with the view that it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis.
  The answer is C:  it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information about a company is spread as widely and quickly as possible. 
  The author believes insider nontrading--stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge--is a far more widespread practice than insider trading.

  Passage B argues that transparency is one of the basic principles of the stock market and argues that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.

  Neither passage condones insider trading, and both passages suggest that investor confidence is important for a healthy stock market.
  However, Passage A argues that it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis, and that selling a stock because one knows something that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping.
  Passage B argues that insider trading unfairly compromises the market, and that undermining investor confidence would deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and have widespread financial repercussions.

  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to agree that "insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market." 
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Both passages mention insider trading and its effects on the stock market, but they take different perspectives on it.
  Passage A argues that insider trading law can hamper the flow of information and reduce the accuracy of stock market prices.
  Passage B argues that transparency and equal access to information are essential to maintaining investor confidence in the stock market.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage B would be most likely to agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A mentions that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  The author of passage A also suggests that someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping.
  The author of passage B argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market and investing decisions are based on the information available to everyone.
  The author of passage B also believes that insider trading unfairly compromises the market by giving some people access to information that others don't have.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market. 
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible and that insider nontrading is a widespread practice that should not be regulated.
  Passage B argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market and that insider trading compromises the market by giving some people an unfair advantage.
  Both passages seem to agree that transparency is important and that insider trading compromises the market in some way.
  The authors are most likely to agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915
  D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain
  E: suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained

Response 3:
Thought:
  The sentence in question is "Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing."
  The authors have already explained the three catalysts of the Great Migration in earlier parts of the passage.
  The previous sentence ("We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration.") suggests that previous migration can have an impact on later migration.
  Therefore, the sentence in question most likely provides a fact about the Great Migration that the authors are seeking to explain further.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The last sentence in the second paragraph refers to "migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration" and "previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit" which was mentioned in the following paragraph.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage describes two types of chemical substances found in plants: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are not required for internal processes of growth or metabolism, but give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances have arisen by mutation, and those that survive and are passed on must be favored by natural selection.
  Some secondary substances are favored because they attract pollinating insects to blossoms, others because they are biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, and still others because they are characteristic smells or tastes that warn insects of the presence of something harmful.
  Which one of the choices most closely describes a set of relationships that is analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
  None of these choices express such a relationship. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Plants contain two types of substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, but their role in internal chemical processes is unknown.
  Secondary substances arise as the result of genetic mutations and are selectively favored if they increase the likelihood of the organism's survival and reproduction.
  Insects play a major role in the plants' evolution of secondary substances.
  The relationships described in choices A, C, D, and E do not closely parallel the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Choice B describes a relationship that closely parallels the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances are characterized by the primary substances being necessary for growth and proper functioning of the plants while the secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The secondary substances arise through genetic mutations and are conserved by natural selection because they have either beneficial or deterrent effects on plants' enemies, including insects.
  The relationship that is most closely analogous to this is one in which one set of components is necessary for a system to work properly, while another set of components gives the system its distinctive features and characteristics.
  The answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances is being compared to something.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Both primary and secondary substances are chemical substances that are part of the plant.
  Secondary substances are not necessary for growth or internal metabolism of the plant, while primary substances are.
  Answer choice B compares necessary mechanical components and features that serve a secondary function, which is most analogous to this scenario.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. 
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning, and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, but give plants their smells and tastes. 
  Some secondary substances attract pollinating insects, while others are defensive and dissuade insects from eating the plant.
  This set of relationships is most closely analogous to (B) mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them. 
  Both primary substances and essential mechanical components are found in all plants and cars, respectively, and are required for proper functioning. 
  Secondary substances and features such as paint and taillights are nonessential but give plants and cars unique characteristics. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question asks for an analogy that describes the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  The passage defines primary and secondary substances and their relationship to plant growth and chemical composition.
  Option A describes a relationship between electricity and hospitals but no direct relationship between hospital functions and electricity's chemical composition or necessary components.
  Option B describes the necessary mechanical components of an automobile, similar to primary substances but does not describe the array of nonessential characteristics of plants analogous to secondary substances.
  Option C describes the relationship between mechanical components and electrical power required to run them in a manufacturing process; this relationship is not analogous to the relationship between primary substances and secondary substances in plants.
  Option D describes the relationship between braking systems and trains' ability to decelerate but does not describe nonessential plant characteristics as analogous to secondary substances.
  Option E describes the relationship between a computer's function as a word processor and the specially designed programs that enable it; the distinction between internal storage and external storage could represent the different distribution of primary and secondary substances between all plants but does not describe the chemical properties of these substances.
  Option B contains the most similar relationship to the one described in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The relationships discussed involve primary and secondary substances in relation to plants.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and present in all plants.
  Secondary substances, which number in the thousands and are plant-specific, give the plant its distinctive odor and taste but have no known role in the plant's internal workings.
  Secondary substances arise because of genetic mutations in individual plants.
  They are conserved by natural selection either because they attract pollinators or because they act as biochemical defenses against the insects that might harm the plant.
  It follows, then, that the answer will describe a set of relationships in which one category is necessary for the proper functioning of the entity in question, while the other is nonessential but still imparts some sort of quality or distinction to the entity the same way secondary substances do for plants.
  The best choice is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances is that primary substances are necessary for the plant to grow and function, while secondary substances give plants their unique tastes and smells.
  The relationship between electrical power and generators is that electrical power is necessary for hospital devices to function properly, and generators are used as a backup source of power in case of an outage.
  The relationships in options C, D, and E do not adequately describe the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants.
  The relationship in option B is analogous to the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants because mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run, just as primary substances are necessary for plants to grow and function. Meanwhile, paint and taillights serve additional functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but they are not required for an automobile to run, similar to how secondary substances are not necessary for a plant to grow and function.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is described as necessary for growth and proper functioning of the plant, but only secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances often have a function as either attracting pollinating insects or defending against insects.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning of the plant, but do not give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Option A describes a necessary backup power source for essential hospital equipment, which is not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Option B describes necessary mechanical components for a car to run, as well as additional features that can improve safety or aesthetics, but are not necessary for the operation of the car. This is somewhat analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances, as primary substances are necessary for the growth and functioning of plants, while secondary substances contribute to taste and smell but are not essential for basic plant processes.
  Option C describes necessary components for the operation of a manufacturing process, but these components are not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Option D describes necessary components for trains to safely decelerate and stop, but these components are not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Option E describes necessary components for a computer to function as a word processor, with programs that can be stored either internally or externally. This is not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it provides the closest analogy to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances are being described.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and varied set of chemicals numbers of which vary from plant to plant.
  Secondary substances increase a plant's likelihood of survival and reproduction by attracting pollinating insects to blossoms and serving as biochemical defenses against insects.
  The correct choice should describe a set of relationships with primary and secondary components.
  Choice (B) is the correct choice.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Thought: 
   The passage mentions Taruskin's view on "high art" and how it is produced by and for political and social elites.
   To construct a subtle analysis of high art, according to Taruskin's view, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
   The passage mentions that talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes.
   The passage suggests that a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
   Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The passage says that Taruskin and some other critics prefer to analyze art that embodied the ideology of the elite to construct an analysis of the way such art embodied this ideology, whatever the identity of the artist.
The passage also says that the most talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment- engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example.
Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
Therefore, it doesn't seem that Taruskin's position would commit him to the view that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite in any particular way.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage presents Taruskin's position as favoring analysis of art produced in a particular way.
Art produced the second way must embody the elites' ideology, enabling subtle analysis of it.
The art produced by the aristocracy and upper middle class has not always been able to produce art that endures.
The sociohistorical critic must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis to claim that some art embodies the elite's ideals in hidden ways.
Taruskin's position commits him to which of these views?
Action: Answer("C") 
Based on the passage, Taruskin's position commits him to the view that if high art appear to undermine the ideology of the elite but endures, it actually supports that ideology in some way.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage describes Taruskin and sociohistorical critics' preference for analyzing art that was commissioned to express the ideals and lifestyle of the elite.
  The passage also cautions that some art may be produced by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings and still endures.
  Taruskin's position leaves room for conceivably subtle ways that some art has come to embody the ideology of the elite.
  The answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage is discussing how art historically has been produced by and for political and social elites in two different ways.
  Taruskin and others prefer to deal with art produced the second way, which must embody the ideology of the elite.
  The passage suggests that to analyze art in this way, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and consensus about the world, and that artists did not subvert the ideals of the patron.
  The passage does not necessarily suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have either embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite. 
  Therefore, it is not choices A or E.
  The passage also does not suggest that the most successful artists working today reflect the ideology of the elite.
  Therefore, it is not choice B.
  The passage suggests that some enduring high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in hidden ways.
  Therefore, the answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
- The passage mentions that Taruskin prefers to deal with art that reflects and mirrors one’s ideals and way of life.
- It must be the case that artists subverted the ideals of the patron (elite) for their own reasons.
- The passage mentions that some of the art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
- The sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin may claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
- The passage does not suggest that the most talented artists were the ones whose work embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two different ways art was produced by and for political and social elites.
  Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way.
  For this kind of analysis to work, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position does not imply that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways. It also does not imply the most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  The passage states that a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Hence, it might appear that elite values are undermined but the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analysis to claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  As a result, the most plausible answer seems to be C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The passage highlights two different ways in which art was produced by and for political and social elites.
The interpretation of the sociohistorical critics, such as Taruskin, on the production of art allows for subtle analysis of how art embodied the ideology of the elite.
Based on the given information, the position that Taruskin has taken is not clear.
Option A, B, and E are not supported by the given information.
Option C can be inferred from the following sentence "Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved."
Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage describes Taruskin's preference for analyzing art produced in a way that expresses and mirrors the ideals and way of life of the elite. 
The passage goes on to cast doubt on the idea that the taste of the elite is always apt to produce art that endures. 
The passage also suggests that some artists found a place in the margins of the establishment, engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes. 
The passage indicates that a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. 
The passage suggests that sometimes such art endured and that this requires a sociohistorical critic like Taruskin to claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite. 
None of these ideas suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite. 
The answer is not A or E. 
The passage does not suggest that the most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
The passage does suggest that if high art endures and appears to undermine the ideology of the elite, that art actually supports that ideology in some way.
The passage does not give information indicating that art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes two different ways how art was produced by and for political and social elites. 
  Sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced the second way. 
  For this kind of analysis to work, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. 
  It implies that art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite is not necessarily supported by it in any way.
  It does not describe the position that Taruskin's holds.
  Therefore, neither option A nor option E is correct.
  Option B is not supported by the passage.
  Option C is the opposite of what the passage implies.
  Option D is the most accurate description of the position that Taruskin holds.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  D: Most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: Dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question focuses on what the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have most likely agreed with about the study of dance.
  According to the passage, dance had been neglected as an area of social research.
  One reason for this was that most social scientists who gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry.
  The passage suggests that Dunham's approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  The passage also mentions that her colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have most likely agreed with the idea that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how dance had been neglected as an area of social research in the past
  This suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have adhered to the long-standing view that certain areas of inquiry were more scientifically rigorous than others, and that dance was not one of these areas.
  Thus, the peers would have preferred social scientists to focus their research on areas deemed more rigorous, and hence would not have supported research on dance as a cultural form.
  The best answer is therefore B, which suggests that peers would not have seen a need for social scientists to be well versed in dance in order to obtain reliable data about it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage states that dance had been neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists did not gravitate toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous modes of inquiry.
  In other words, peers expected social research to be scientifically rigorous.
  The passage goes on to describe Dunham's unconventional research method, implying that it diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  However, because of her unique approach, Dunham was able to not only comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
  The passage does not state or imply that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance misinterpreted it, that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them, that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision, that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology, or that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
  The best answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them, since this statement contrasts with the passage's emphasis on Dunham's successful approach to research that involved prolonged immersion in the dances she was observing. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage talks about how dance was previously neglected as an area of social research.
  The passage also mentions the prevailing methodology at the time, which was to be detached from the subject matter.
  The peers in line 22 are likely those who adhere to the prevailing methodology.
  Therefore, the peers are most likely to agree with the statement that "Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them," as this statement reflects a detached approach to research.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how dance had been neglected as an area of social research due to the lack of expertise.
  The passage explains that social scientists were not well versed in dance traditions and did not understand its techniques.
  The passage suggests that colleagues in anthropology subscribed to the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  However, Dunham's approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in the passage would most likely have agreed that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  The correct answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The author describes how dance was previously neglected as an area of social research because many social scientists did not understand dance technique and were not trained in the methods of social research.
  The author also describes how Katherine Dunham's success in bringing traditional dance techniques into mainstream North American dance was due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  There is no indication that the peers mentioned in line 22 agreed with any of the statements given in the answer choices.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The peers mentioned in line 22 hold that effective data gathering can be conducted when the researcher is detached from the subject.
This view may have prevented social scientists from studying dance because they were not sufficiently trained in dance, nor in the methods of social research.
Therefore, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The "peers" mentioned in line 22 refers to the social scientists who thought that other areas would have been more suitable for social research.
  The following sentence explains why previously no research had been conducted on dance ethnology.
  None of the choices except for choice B directly addresses the peers' opinion on the relationship between social research and dance.
  Choice B goes against Dunham's approach to research. 
  Therefore, the answer is NOT B.
  Among the remaining four choices, only choice C mildly shows a similarity to the peers' opinion and seems to imply that research into dance as a cultural form is imprecise.
  Hence the answer is C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The peers mentioned in the passage disagree with the idea of involvement in the dances while observing because of extreme physical demands and their positions. 
  The methodology currently followed by peers did not take dance seriously as an area of social research. 
  Therefore, peers would disagree with the idea that Social scientists need not be well versed in dance tradition in order to obtain reliable data about them. 
  The answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage explains that previously dance had been neglected as an area of social research.
  The reason for this was that most social scientist did not have expertise in dance and the experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research.
  The author mentions that Katherine Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at that time.
  The peers may have shared the methodology that prevailed at that time.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have most likely agreed with the view that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. 
  The answer is B: Social scientists need not be well-versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: We are told that it is not within the "province of woman," to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a "political question," and we are "stepping out of our  sphere," when we take part in its discussion. It is nottrue that it is merely a political question, it is likewise a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of religion; a question which, while it involves considerations of immense importance to the welfare and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into thehome-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to unrequited toil-whether he shall walk erect in the dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckonedamong the beasts which perish - whether his bones and sinews shall be his own, or another's-whether his child shall receive the protection of its natural guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest ofthe master may dictate $\_\ldots$ these considerations are all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.And is a subject comprehending interests of such magnitude, merely a "political question," and one in which woman "can take no part without losingsomething of the modesty and gentleness which are her most appropriate ornaments"? May not the "ornament of a meek and quiet spirit" exist with an upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart isopen to the claims of humanity, or less modest because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their rescue?By the Constitution of the United States, the  whole physical power of the North is pledged for the suppression of domestic insurrections, and should the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the North are bound to make common cause with the 40 tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet, every effort on the part of the slave, for the attainment of his freedom. And when the father, husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes to mingle in the unholy warfare, "to become the 45 executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands,"1 will the mother, wife, daughter, and sister feel that they have no interest in this subject? Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and50 their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she55 will not be deterred from the performance of her duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the cry of political question.But admitting it to be a political question, have we no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not60 permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of our own family circle, and of the present hour? May we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the 65 earth? Must we witness "the headlong rage or heedless folly," with which our nation is rushing onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its downward course? Shall we silently behold the land which we love with all the heart-warm affection of70 children, rendered a hissing and a reproach throughout the world, by this system which is already tolling the death-bell of her decease among the nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright75 prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely our hearts cling to "our altars and our homes," the80 more fervent are our aspirations that every inhabitant of our land may be protected in his fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom85 God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our course, then, still be onward!

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt.

Choices:
  A: Vesta is not the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt.
  B: the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
  C: iron fragments in the asteroid belt tend to be smaller than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
  D: there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the rarity of mantle rocks in the asteroid belt, known as the "missing mantle problem".
  The passage suggests that collisional erosion cannot be the whole story.
  Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
  The passage suggests that most differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions.
  Gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt.
  Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
  Therefore, if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find that there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  The answer is D: there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" and how iron fragments are more likely to survive than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart.
  Primitive asteroids, which are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids, have survived, leaving an asteroid belt that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.
  The passage suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then it would mean that almost all differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions.
  Therefore, the passage does not suggest any of the answer choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that differentiated asteroids are rare and most of them have been destroyed in violent collisions.
  Primitive asteroids are less strong than differentiated asteroids.
  If collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then the primitive asteroids would also have been destroyed.
  Therefore, there would be far fewer primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt than it currently does.
  The answer is B: the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that differentiated asteroids were relatively rare to begin with and none have survived.
  If almost all differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions, then the number of differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt would be very small.
  Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
  If collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then the number of primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt would be very small.
  The passage does not mention anything about the size of iron fragments compared to rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt.
  The passage suggests that most differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions and scattered into the asteroid belt.
  Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
  Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
  Most of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.
  Therefore, if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find that the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," which is the rarity of mantle rocks in the asteroid belt.
  The passage suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation, then intact differentiated asteroids would be very rare in the asteroid belt today.
  The passage does not suggest any correlation between collisional erosion and the size of iron fragments or rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
  The passage does not suggest that there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  The passage suggests that the parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets.
  Therefore, if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation, scientists would expect to find that intact differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid belt today.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that collisional erosion cannot be the whole story in explaining the missing mantle problem.
  Primitive asteroids are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
  Differentiated bodies were relatively rare to begin with and none have survived.
  If almost all differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions, then the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun.
  Objects would have been more tightly packed nearer to the Sun, so collisions would have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt.
  Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions.
  Gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt.
  Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
  Therefore, if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find that there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  The answer is D: there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage states that if collisional erosion were the sole explanation for the missing mantle problem, then most differentiated asteroids would have been destroyed, leaving only a few intact bodies like Vesta. 
  Primitive asteroids, on the other hand, are no stronger than differentiated asteroids. 
  The passage does not suggest that the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does, nor does it suggest that iron fragments in the asteroid belt tend to be smaller than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
  The passage also does not provide information on the relative numbers of primitive and differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Vesta is not the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" and why rocky fragments may be less likely to survive in the asteroid belt than iron fragments.
  If collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, it would mean that rocky fragments have been removed at a higher rate than iron fragments.
  Therefore, scientists would expect to find that iron fragments in the asteroid belt are more common or larger than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
  The passage does not provide evidence to support any of the other answer choices.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the rarity of mantle rocks in the asteroid belt and the missing mantle problem.
  The passage suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then most differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions.
  If most differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions, then scientists would expect to find that the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Many millennia before the invention of herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a  valuable part of an integrated weed-management 5 program. Although plowing kills standing weeds, farmers have long known that it often leads to the emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.Ecologists have shown that a farmer's field can have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter 10 buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists have shown that seeds buried more than about one centimeter below the soil surface do not receive enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow, which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil15 surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the surface where their germination is induced by exposure to sunlight?Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a 20 relatively simple experiment, they went to ten different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then25 exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples, weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives weed seeds a "light break," and this stimulates their 30 germination.More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen University in Germany reasoned that when farmers plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is35 turned over, and that this stimulates their germination. Although the light exposures from plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the germination of weed seeds would be minimized if40 farmers simply plowed their fields during the night, when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which photons hit the surface] is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second. Although even under these conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike 45 each square millimeter of ground each second, this illumination is below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when he first came up with this idea because he assumed 50 that such a simple method of weed control as plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated 55 that the method can be effective.Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip60 at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas 65 only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.This method of weed control is currently being used by several farmers in Germany. Because many of the same weed species that invade farmers' fields70 in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world, this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact, recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon, Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina support this idea.

Question: The passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been
Choices:
  A: lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
  B: higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.
  C: nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
  D: comparable to Hartmann's original projection.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Hartmann's experiment compared the percentage of weeds on two agricultural strips plowed at different times.
  The strips were not planted with crops to avoid competition with emerging weeds.
  It is not clear what would happen if the strips had been planted with crops.
  Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the percentage of the surface covered with weeds would be higher or lower.
  The answer is C: nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  In the experiment conducted by Hartmann, no crops were planted in the pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  Therefore, it is not possible to determine how the growth of crops would affect the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds.
  The passage does not provide any information to suggest that planting crops would affect the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds.
  Therefore, the answer is C: nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The experiment conducted by Hartmann was a pilot study and no crops were planted in the strips to avoid competition with the emerging weeds.
  The results of the experiment showed that the strip plowed at night had only about 2% of the surface covered with weeds, while the strip plowed during the day had over 80% of the surface covered with weeds.
  It is suggested that this method of weed control should be successful elsewhere.
  The passage does not provide any information or speculation about how the planting of crops would affect the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The experiment was performed with no crops planted to avoid competition with the emerging weeds.
  The results showed that more than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  If Seydel had planted wheat or corn, the presence of crops could have affected the results.
  Therefore, we cannot assume what the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would have been.
  The answer is C: nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The experiment conducted by Hartmann was done without planting any crops in the field.
  The percentage of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds more than 80%, and only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  If Seydel had planted wheat or corn, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been affected.
  As the passage does not provide any information about the impact of planting crops on weed growth, it is difficult to determine the exact outcome.
  Therefore, the answer is nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  In Hartmann's experiment, no crops were planted to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  If Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, it is likely that the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would be different.
  However, the passage does not provide information to determine whether the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would be higher or lower.
  Therefore, it is difficult to determine the most accurate answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The experiment conducted by Hartmann involved plowing two agricultural strips at different times of the day.
  No crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  The percentage of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds more than the field plowed at night.
  If Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been different.
  However, the passage does not provide enough information to determine whether it would have been higher or lower.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The experiment conducted by Hartmann was a pilot experiment.
  No crops were planted in the pilot experiment to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  The passage does not provide any information about the effect of planting crops on the percentage of surface covered with weeds.
  Therefore, it is impossible to determine the percentage of surface covered with weeds if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment.
  The answer is C: nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The experiment conducted by Hartmann involved plowing two agricultural strips without planting any crops.
  The percentage of surface covered with weeds in the strip plowed during the day was more than 80 percent.
  The percentage of surface covered with weeds in the strip plowed at night was about 2 percent.
  Since no crops were planted, there was no competition with the emerging weeds.
  If Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the emergence of crops would have competed with the emerging weeds.
  Therefore, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been higher than the percentage that Hartmann found.
  The answer is B: higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, "Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."40 He picked up a bird shape: "Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought." He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: "Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind."As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. "Look here," Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. "See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this." And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. "The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price."I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.

  The passage suggests that women are not excluded from important duties or influence because of their subordinate position.
  Instead, women gain influence by appealing to "kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles."
  The passage emphasizes the importance of women cultivating their intellect and character to gain respect and influence.
  The passage suggests that women should focus on the domestic and social sphere, and that women who engage in combative or coercive behavior are outside of their appropriate sphere.
  Based on this, Beecher's implication is likely that women's effect on public life is largely indirect, because they primarily exert their influence within the home and family life.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: The data in table 2 best support which statement about the woodpecker finches that used the unique levering technique to acquire prey?
Choices:
  A: At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
  B: After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether.
  C: After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
  D: None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question is asking about the data in Table 2.
  The data in Table 2 show the number of attempts made by each bird before successfully acquiring prey using the unique levering technique.
  Therefore, we need to examine the data in Table 2 to determine which statement is best supported.
  According to Table 2, all five birds successfully acquired prey using the unique levering technique.
  The number of attempts made by each bird varied from 1 to 16.
  None of the birds attempted the technique more than 16 times.
  Therefore, statement C is the best supported by the data in Table 2.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to refer to Table 2 to determine the best answer.
  Table 2 shows the number of times each individual used the levering technique before acquiring prey.
  The data shows that all individuals successfully acquired prey using the levering technique.
  However, the number of attempts before success varied from 1 to 8.
  There is no information in Table 2 about any individual attempting the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
  There is also no information about any individual ceasing to use the technique after the first success.
  The data shows that some individuals attempted the technique more than five times after their first success.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question refers to table 2, which is not provided in the context.
  Without the table, it is difficult to determine the exact number of attempts made by the birds.
  However, the context mentions that "each of these birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice."
  It also mentions that "after initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method."
  Therefore, it is likely that the woodpecker finches were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
  Option C states that "After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times." This is not supported by the context.
  Option A states that "At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey." This is also not supported by the context.
  Option B states that "After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether." This is not mentioned in the context.
  Option D states that "None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique." This contradicts the context.
  Therefore, the best answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to look at Table 2 to find information about the woodpecker finches and their use of the unique levering technique to acquire prey.
  According to the passage, the five birds that developed the levering technique were successful in using it to acquire prey.
  The passage also mentions that after initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.
  We do not have any information in the passage that indicates that any of the birds attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
  We also do not have any information in the passage that indicates that any of the birds ceased using the technique altogether after the first success.
  According to the passage, the birds significantly increased their use of the technique after initial success.
  Therefore, the data in Table 2 best support the statement that after the first success at acquiring prey, none of the birds attempted the technique more than five times.
  The answer is C: After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The question refers to Table 2, but there is no information provided about Table 2 in the given context.
  Therefore, I cannot answer this question.
Action: None of the above.
Response 5:
Thought:
  Table 2 shows the number of times each bird attempted and succeeded in using the unique levering technique to acquire prey.
  The table shows that all five birds were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
  There is no information in the table to support option A.
  There is no information in the table to support option B.
  Option C is partially correct, as the table shows that none of the birds attempted the technique more than five times after their first success.
  Option D is incorrect, as the table shows that all five birds were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Table 2 is not provided in the context.
  However, the context mentions that the five woodpecker finches that developed the unique levering technique deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild.
  They dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice.
  After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.
  Therefore, the data in Table 2 would likely support the statement that after the first success at acquiring prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis," says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. "Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth," Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. "We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment," Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 "standard of care treatment." That's going to take five years and $\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.
Question: Information in Passage 2 best supports which conclusion about the mice in the experiment described in Passage 1?
Choices:
  A: Exposure to teixobactin made them less susceptible to subsequent upper respiratory tract infections.
  B: Gram-positive bacteria enhanced the effectiveness of teixobactin against their upper respiratory tract infections.
  C: Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
  D: Teixobactin attacked the proteins of the bacteria that caused their upper respiratory tract infections.
Response 0:
Thought:

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: According to the passage, which statement best explains why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close?
Choices:
  A: The second trigger produces an electrical charge that reverses the charge produced by the first trigger.
  B: The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.
  C: The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open.
  D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these "low-threshold" nerves "C-tactile," or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their "exquisite sensitivity" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations
Question: Based on the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected which condition to result from the blocking of fast fibers?
Choices:
  A: The rate at which other nerve fibers fired would increase.
  B: The test subject would perceive gentle stimuli as painful.
  C: The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
  D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.

Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect

  The passage discusses the composition of different types of asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  Primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
  The majority of differentiated asteroids have lost their mantle material, leaving only the iron core intact.
  Iron fragments are stronger than rocky fragments and are more likely to survive in the asteroid belt.
  The passage does not provide information on the reflectivity of asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  Therefore, the answer is A: primitive.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The article mentions that primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
  It also mentions that the parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun.
  However, it does not provide any information about the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt in terms of reflectivity or basaltic composition.
  Therefore, I cannot determine the answer based on the given information.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes the composition of asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  Primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
  The passage suggests that the majority of the asteroids in the asteroid belt are a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.
  The passage does not provide information to support the conclusion that the asteroids in the asteroid belt are basaltic or high in reflectivity.
  The answer is A: primitive.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The article discusses the differentiation of asteroids into iron and rocky mantles.
  It describes how rocky fragments may be lost over time while iron fragments survive longer due to their strength.
  It also suggests that the parent bodies of iron meteorites may have formed closer to the sun and thus were more tightly packed and subjected to more collisions.
  There is no clear data in the article to support any of the choices.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The article discusses the rarity of mantle rocks in the asteroid belt and how iron fragments are more likely to survive than rocky fragments.
  The article also mentions that primitive asteroids, which are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
  The article suggests that differentiated bodies were relatively rare to begin with and that most of them were destroyed in violent collisions.
  The article proposes that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, while the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt.
  Therefore, it is not clear from the article whether the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt as a whole is in asteroids that are primitive, basaltic, high in reflectivity, or low in reflectivity.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
  The passage also mentions that most differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions.
  The iron fragments of these differentiated bodies have survived better than the rocky fragments due to the strength of iron.
  The parent bodies of the iron meteorites may have formed closer to the Sun, in a region that now contains the terrestrial planets.
  Later on, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt.
  Primitive asteroids are not necessarily stronger than mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
  Therefore, the data in the table is unlikely to be related to the strength of asteroids.
  The data in the table is more likely to be related to the reflectivity of asteroids.
  The table shows that the majority of asteroids have low to moderate reflectivity, while a smaller number have high reflectivity.
  Therefore, the answer is D: low in reflectivity.
Action: Answer("D")

  The passage discusses the composition of asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  The passage mentions that primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
  The passage also mentions that differentiated asteroids, which have iron cores and rocky mantles, are rare in the asteroid belt.
  Therefore, the data in the passage best support the conclusion that the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt as a whole is in asteroids that are primitive.
  The answer is A: primitive.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the composition of various asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  The table mentioned in the question provides information on the number and size of asteroids in different categories based on their spectral characteristics.
  There are three categories based on spectral characteristics: C-type, S-type, and M-type.
  The passage does not provide information on the mass of asteroids based on their spectral characteristics.
  Therefore, the data in the table does not support any of the given choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the composition and survival of asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  The passage does not mention the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt as a whole.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: If Meltzer’s findings (Passage 2) are accurate, what can most reasonably be inferred about the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1?
Choices:
  A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  B: They are a product of the global cooling that occurred during the Younger Dryas period.
  C: They were found in highest concentrations at Clovis archaeological sites.
  D: They may have played some role in the tool technology of the Clovis people.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage 1 states that the team found spherules of glass and carbon that suggest an extraterrestrial impact.
  Passage 2 argues that only three of the 29 sites examined by Meltzer's team fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
  The Younger Dryas onset is the period when the extraterrestrial impact occurred, according to Passage 1.
  If Meltzer's findings are accurate, then the extraterrestrial impact occurred at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  Therefore, the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  The answer is A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage 1 mentions the discovery of glass and carbon spherules in sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites.
  The team argues that these spherules were formed by an extraterrestrial impact.
  Passage 2 explains that Meltzer's team examined 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision, including the Clovis archaeological sites.
  Meltzer's team argues that only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago.
  Therefore, if Meltzer's findings are accurate, it can most reasonably be inferred that the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  The answer is A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The glass and carbon spherules were mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1.
  The team argues that the spherules contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact.
  Meltzer's team argues that only three of the 29 sites examined actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
  Meltzer's team argues that the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years.

Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage 1 mentions that geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America suggested that they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact, including spherules of glass and carbon.
  Passage 2 mentions that Meltzer's team looked at the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision, including sites in which Clovis points have been found. Meltzer's team argues that only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years.
  If Meltzer’s findings are accurate, it can be inferred that the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas, as the evidence for a cosmic collision provided by the impact advocates may not be reliable.
  The answer is A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage 1 describes how scientists presented evidence that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, which showered debris across the North American continent and caused temperatures to plunge for the next millennium.
  The team argues that its idea explains multiple observations: not only the climate cooling and the disappearance of the Clovis hunters but also the near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large mammals.
  The new evidence comes in the form of geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America—9 of them Clovis. Certain features of the layers suggest that they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact, including spherules of glass and carbon, and amounts of the element iridium said to be too high to have originated on Earth.
  Passage 2 argues that when the quality and accuracy of the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision, is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years.
  Therefore, if Meltzer's findings are accurate, it can most reasonably be inferred that the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas. The answer is A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.

  Meltzer's team argues that only 3 of the 29 sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
  Therefore, if Meltzer's findings are accurate, it can be inferred that the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.

Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage 1 describes the evidence for a comet or asteroid impact that caused temperatures to plunge for the next millennium, leading to the disappearance of Clovis hunters and large mammals, and the new evidence in the form of geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America.
  Passage 2 presents a counterargument to the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which is based on the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, including sites where Clovis points have been found, and argues that only three of them actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago.
  The last paragraph of Passage 1 mentions that the team found spherules of glass and carbon, and amounts of the element iridium in the sedimentary layers, which suggest that they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact.
  If Meltzer's findings are accurate, it would indicate that the dating of the sedimentary layers containing the glass and carbon spherules might not be accurate and that they could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  Therefore, the most reasonable inference would be A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage 1 suggests that the glass and carbon spherules, along with other evidence, support the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  In contrast, Passage 2 argues that the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis is not supported by evidence from 29 different sites.
  Meltzer argues that only three of the 29 sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
  Therefore, if Meltzer's findings are accurate, it can be reasonably inferred that the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.

  Meltzer's team examined the dating of 29 sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which impact advocates have reported evidence of a cosmic collision. They concluded that only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
  Glass and carbon spherules were mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1. It is not explicitly stated when they were formed.
  If Meltzer's findings are accurate, then the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land  where they were born; and that they areproperty-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose ofall these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a 15 greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction.Any other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women's20 interest to change the assignment they have received.It seems to us incontestable that our common happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in25 the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the30 home? And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a35 manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life's companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand 40 that the good of all demands this of you.\section{Passage 2}Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of45 knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her50 reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an55 orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations....Consider, sir, dispassionately, these60 observations-for a glimpse of this truth seemed to open before you when you observed, "that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it65 was impossible to explain." If so, on what does your constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this70 country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman-prescription.Consider-I address you as a legislatorwhether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their75 own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift 80 of reason?In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination, from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be 85 useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark?

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Follow the money and you will end up in space. That's the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on mining beyond Earth.Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for 5 Space Engineering Research, the event brought together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar scientists, and government agencies that are all working to make space mining a reality.The forum comes hot on the heels of the 102012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms. Planetary Resources of Washington says it will launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years, while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020 . Another15 commercial venture that sprung up in 2012, Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to the moon, including to potential lunar miners.Within a few decades, these firms may be meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as20 platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital for personal electronics, such as yttrium and lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who transformed the western United States, the first space miners won't just enrich themselves. They also hope25 to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds with Earth, in which the materials extracted and processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered for space-based projects.In this scenario, water mined from other 30 worlds could become the most desired commodity. "In the desert, what's worth more: a kilogram of gold or a kilogram of water?" asks Kris Zacny of HoneyBee Robotics in New York. "Gold is useless. Water will let you live."35 Water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary 40 refuelling stations. Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into 45 concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.\section{Passage 2}The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting from discovery to economics. The past year has seen a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few0 billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain: the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could enrich us all.But before the miners start firing up their rockets, we should pause for thought. At first glance, space55 mining seems to sidestep most environmental concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids, and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences -both here on Earth and in space -merit careful consideration.60 Part of this is about principles. Some will argue that space's "magnificent desolation" is not ours to despoil, just as they argue that our own planet's poles should remain pristine. Others will suggest that glutting ourselves on space's riches is not an65 acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable ways of earthly life.History suggests that those will be hard lines to hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public that such barren environments are worth preserving.70 After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even fewer people will experience them than have walked through Antarctica's icy landscapes.There's also the emerging off-world economy to consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and 75 beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely been broached-and the relevant legal and regulatory framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are 80 often reluctant to engage with such questions.One speaker at last week's space-mining forum in Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that regulation should be avoided. But miners have much to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit 85 exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek one out

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out what effect, if any, all that driving around the  labyrinthine streets of London might have oncabbies' brains. When she brought sixteen taxi drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an MRI scanner, she found one surprising and important difference. The right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain known to beinvolved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in the cabbies-a small but very significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of that way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains. The moreyears a cabbie had been on the road, the more pronounced the effect.The brain is a mutable organ, capable-within limits-of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known asneuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons-that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain's basic anatomical structurewas more or less static. Maguire's study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.After her groundbreaking study of London cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to mental athletes. She teamed up with ElizabethValentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic monograph Superior Memory, to study ten individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were-like the Londoncabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners  and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it was possible that they might discover anatomical 45 differences in the brains of the memory champs, evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized themselves in the process of doing all that intensive remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the imaging data, not a single significant structural50 difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects. What's more, on every single test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes' scores came back well within the normal range. The 55 memory champs weren't smarter, and they didn't have special brains.But there was one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects: When the researchers looked at which parts of the 60 brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry. According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be 65 working in overdrive for the mental athletes.Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial70 navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first glance, this wouldn't seem to make any sense. Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in 75 their mind's eye when they were trying to learn three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating like London cabbies when they're supposed to be remembering the shapes of snowflakes?Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes 80 to describe exactly what was going through their minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said they were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, and distributing those images along familiar spatial85 journeys. They weren't doing this automatically, or because it was an inborn talent they'd nurtured since childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural activity that Maguire's fMRIs turned up were the result of training and practice
Question: Which question was Maguire's study of mental athletes primarily intended to answer?
Choices:
  A: Does the act of memorization make use of different brain structures than does the act of navigation?
  B: Do mental athletes inherit their unusual brain structures, or do the structures develop as a result of specific activities?
  C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
  D: What is the relationship between general cognitive ability and the unusual brain structures of mental athletes?

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, what potential criticism might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model?
Choices:
  A: Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect.
  B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  C: Volkov's direct application of an electrical current would have been objectionable to Hodick and Sievers.
  D: Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes how Hodick and Sievers proposed that the Venus flytrap encodes the information about its prey by electric charge and calcium ion concentration.
  Subsequent research by Volkov and his colleagues supports this model.
  Volkov's experiment involved applying an electrical current to the trap, which made it close.
  The experiment did not measure calcium levels, but it likely led to increases.
  The experiment determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
  Therefore, the potential criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model might be that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Hodick and Sievers's model for how the Venus flytrap encodes and stores information about prey.
  Volkov and his colleagues conducted experiments to test this model.
  The experiment involved applying an electrical current to the Venus flytrap and observing its response.
  The passage does not suggest that Volkov misunderstood the model or that Hodick and Sievers would object to his experiment.
  However, the passage does suggest that Volkov's measurements may not have fully corroborated a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Specifically, the passage suggests that Volkov did not measure calcium levels in the Venus flytrap, which is a key part of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Hodick and Sievers's model of how the Venus flytrap encodes and stores information regarding how many trigger hairs have been touched by an insect, and how Volkov and his colleagues tested this model.
  The passage states that Volkov and his colleagues demonstrated that electricity causes the Venus flytrap to close and that they were able to determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
  The passage also suggests that Volkov's testing supported Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that a criticism of Volkov's testing would be that his understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect or that his technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
  The passage does not suggest that Hodick and Sievers would have found Volkov's direct application of an electrical current objectionable.
  Thus, the most likely potential criticism of Volkov's testing is that his measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  The answer is B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Hodick and Sievers's model for how the Venus flytrap stores memory.
  Volkov's colleagues tested the Venus flytrap using electrical current and found that it caused the trap to close.
  The passage suggests that the electrical charge likely increases calcium levels, which supports Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that a criticism of Volkov's testing would be that his understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect, or that his technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
  The passage does not suggest that Hodick and Sievers would object to Volkov's direct application of an electrical current.
  The most likely criticism of Volkov's testing would be that his measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.

Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses Hodick and Sievers's model for how the Venus flytrap stores information.

  Volkov and his colleagues tested the model by applying an electrical current to the trap.
  The passage states that this experiment made the trap close and that it likely led to increases in calcium levels.
  Therefore, the experiment supports Hodick and Sievers's model.
  The passage does not suggest any potential criticism of Volkov's testing of the model.
  Answer choice B suggests that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model, but this is contradicted by the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Hodick and Sievers's model of the Venus flytrap's memory system.
  Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University tested the model by applying an electrical current to the flytrap's lobes.
  Volkov was able to determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
  The passage does not suggest any criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Volkov's experiment as a test of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Volkov's experiment involved applying an electrical current to the trap.
  The experiment made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs.
  The experiment determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
  The passage does not suggest that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect or that Hodick and Sievers would object to Volkov's experiment.
  However, the passage suggests that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Therefore, the potential criticism that could be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Volkov's experiment and Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Volkov's experiment demonstrated that electricity causes the Venus flytrap to close.
  Volkov's experiment also determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
  The passage does not suggest that Volkov misunderstood Hodick and Sievers's model.
  The passage does not suggest that Hodick and Sievers would object to Volkov's experiment.
  However, the passage does suggest that Volkov's measurements may not have corroborated a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  According to Hodick and Sievers's model, the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
  Volkov's experiment did not measure calcium levels, so it is unclear whether the electrical charge needed for the trap to close is related to calcium concentration.
  Therefore, the potential criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how Hodick and Sievers proposed that the Venus flytrap stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf, and that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
  Subsequent research supports this model.
  Volkov and his colleagues first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close, and they modified an experiment to determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model would receive criticism that his understanding of the model was incorrect or that his technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
  However, there may be a potential criticism related to the measurements not corroborating a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes Hodick and Sievers's model that the Venus flytrap stores information in the electric charge of its leaf.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Voters need to understand the prosaic details of.complex policies. Most have staked out positions on.these issues, but they are not often reasoned.positions, which take hard intellectual work. Most.citizens opt instead for simplistic explanations,.assuming wrongly that they comprehend the nuances.of issues..Psychological scientists have a name for this.easy, automatic, simplistic thinking: the illusion of.explanatory depth. We strongly believe that we.understand complex matters, when in fact we are.clueless, and these false and extreme beliefs.shape our preferences, judgments, and actions—.including our votes..Is it possible to shake such deep-rooted.convictions? That’s the question that Philip.Fernbach, a psychological scientist at the University.of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business, wanted to.explore. Fernbach and his colleagues wondered if.forcing people to explain complex policies in.detail—not cheerleading for a position but really.considering the mechanics of implementation—.might force them to confront their ignorance and.thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. They.ran a series of lab experiments to test this idea..They started by recruiting a group of volunteers in.their 30s—Democrats, Republicans, and.Independents—and asking them to state their.positions on a variety of issues, from a national flat.tax to a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions..The volunteers indicated how strongly they felt about.each issue and also rated their own understanding of.the issues. Then the volunteers were instructed to.write elaborate explanations of two issues. If the issue.was cap and trade, for example, they would first.explain precisely what cap and trade means, how it is.implemented, whom it benefits and whom it could.hurt, the sources of carbon emissions, and so forth..They were not asked for value judgments about the.policy or about the environment or business, but.only for a highly detailed description of the.mechanics of the policy in action..Let’s be honest: Most of us never do this..Fernbach’s idea was that such an exercise would.force many to realize just how little they really know.about cap and trade, and confronted with their own.ignorance, they would dampen their own.enthusiasm. They would be humbled and as a result.take less extreme positions. And that’s just what.happened. Trying—and failing—to explain complex.policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about.being well-informed. They became more moderate in.their views as a result..Being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a.policy is not the same as trying to sell that policy..In fact, talking about one’s views can often.strengthen them. Fernbach believes it’s the slow,.cognitive work—the deliberate analysis—that.changes people’s judgments, but he wanted to check.this in another experiment. This one was very similar.to the first, but some volunteers, instead of.explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it..The results were clear. Those who simply listed.reasons for their positions—articulating their.values—were less shaken in their views. They.continued to think they understood the policies in.their complexity, and, notably, they remained.extreme in their passion for their positions..Polarization tends to reinforce itself. People are.unaware of their own ignorance, and they seek out.information that bolsters their views, often without.knowing it. They also process new information in.biased ways, and they hang out with people like.themselves. All of these psychological forces increase.political extremism, and no simple measure will.change that. But forcing the candidates to provide.concrete and elaborate plans might be a start; it gives.citizens a starting place.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.

  Passage 1 discusses a hypothesis that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago. The hypothesis attributes the extinction of Clovis hunters and the North American continent's large mammals to the impact. The passage highlights the evidence supporting and contesting the hypothesis.
  Passage 2 critiques the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. The paper examines the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East where impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision. The author argues that only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years. The author concludes that the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis fails on both theoretical and empirical grounds.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two passages is that Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage 1 describes a hypothesis that an asteroid or comet caused the Younger Dryas cooling and extinction of large mammals and Clovis hunters.

  Therefore, Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage 1 talks about the hypothesis that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago and caused temperatures to plunge for the next millennium. The team presents evidence in the form of geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America.
  Passage 2 presents a critique of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. The team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas, looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision. They argue that, when the quality and accuracy of the dating is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two passages is that Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage 1 discusses a hypothesis about an extraterrestrial impact that caused a climate cooling and the disappearance of the Clovis hunters and large mammals.
  Passage 2 presents an argument against the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which includes the evidence used to support it.
  Passage 2 also criticizes the dating methods of the supposed impact sites.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two passages is that Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden  with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are 5 the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the10 procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those15 doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty20 years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that25 makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively30 no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us35 then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old40 family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so 45 long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The0 questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that55 procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will60 object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men65 have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our70 brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the75 gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this "civilization" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in80 them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Another man might have thrown up his.hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters.acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with.Line satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of.a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course.knew that he must proliferate his sources of.revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni.for tending the tube wells would not even begin to.suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off.a condemned electric motor—condemned by him..He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at.the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken.radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not.demur even when asked to fix watches, though that.enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned.him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took.apart ever kept time again..K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived.mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,.Nawab would place himself night and day at the door.leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled.grove of ancient banyan trees where the old.farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator.glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the.household machinery, the air conditioners, water.heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an.engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer.in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he.almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the.same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and.lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in.Lahore..Harouni of course became familiar with this.ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on.his tours of inspection, but morning and night could.be found standing on the master bed rewiring the.light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water.heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the.psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say.a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his.nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him.to go ahead..“Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to.the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube.wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is.but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have.earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to.show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties.as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive.me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud.hunger within than disgrace in the light of day..Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”.The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of.speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at.his nails and waited for the breeze to stop..“What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”.Unauthorized copying or reuse of any part of this page is illegal. **22 CONTINUE**.“Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your.service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,.on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the.many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery.fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a.bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I.first had the good fortune to enter your employment..I beg you, sir, let me go.”.“And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing.that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly.care one way or the other, except that it touched on.his comfort—a matter of great interest to him..“Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could.somehow limp along, at least until I train up some.younger man.”.The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt.expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the.disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a.brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even.managed to extract an allowance for gasoline..The motorcycle increased his status, gave him.weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and.asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he.knew absolutely nothing. He could now range.further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,.now he could spend every night with his wife, who.had begged to live not on the farm but near her.family in Firoza, where also they could educate at.least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road.ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way.to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni.lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new.machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every.knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,.seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial.wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to.whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears.almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his.arrival.

According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Voters need to understand the prosaic details of.complex policies. Most have staked out positions on.these issues, but they are not often reasoned.positions, which take hard intellectual work. Most.citizens opt instead for simplistic explanations,.assuming wrongly that they comprehend the nuances.of issues..Psychological scientists have a name for this.easy, automatic, simplistic thinking: the illusion of.explanatory depth. We strongly believe that we.understand complex matters, when in fact we are.clueless, and these false and extreme beliefs.shape our preferences, judgments, and actions—.including our votes..Is it possible to shake such deep-rooted.convictions? That’s the question that Philip.Fernbach, a psychological scientist at the University.of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business, wanted to.explore. Fernbach and his colleagues wondered if.forcing people to explain complex policies in.detail—not cheerleading for a position but really.considering the mechanics of implementation—.might force them to confront their ignorance and.thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. They.ran a series of lab experiments to test this idea..They started by recruiting a group of volunteers in.their 30s—Democrats, Republicans, and.Independents—and asking them to state their.positions on a variety of issues, from a national flat.tax to a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions..The volunteers indicated how strongly they felt about.each issue and also rated their own understanding of.the issues. Then the volunteers were instructed to.write elaborate explanations of two issues. If the issue.was cap and trade, for example, they would first.explain precisely what cap and trade means, how it is.implemented, whom it benefits and whom it could.hurt, the sources of carbon emissions, and so forth..They were not asked for value judgments about the.policy or about the environment or business, but.only for a highly detailed description of the.mechanics of the policy in action..Let’s be honest: Most of us never do this..Fernbach’s idea was that such an exercise would.force many to realize just how little they really know.about cap and trade, and confronted with their own.ignorance, they would dampen their own.enthusiasm. They would be humbled and as a result.take less extreme positions. And that’s just what.happened. Trying—and failing—to explain complex.policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about.being well-informed. They became more moderate in.their views as a result..Being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a.policy is not the same as trying to sell that policy..In fact, talking about one’s views can often.strengthen them. Fernbach believes it’s the slow,.cognitive work—the deliberate analysis—that.changes people’s judgments, but he wanted to check.this in another experiment. This one was very similar.to the first, but some volunteers, instead of.explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it..The results were clear. Those who simply listed.reasons for their positions—articulating their.values—were less shaken in their views. They.continued to think they understood the policies in.their complexity, and, notably, they remained.extreme in their passion for their positions..Polarization tends to reinforce itself. People are.unaware of their own ignorance, and they seek out.information that bolsters their views, often without.knowing it. They also process new information in.biased ways, and they hang out with people like.themselves. All of these psychological forces increase.political extremism, and no simple measure will.change that. But forcing the candidates to provide.concrete and elaborate plans might be a start; it gives.citizens a starting place.
Question: The passage implies that when conducting his laboratorywork, Fernbach would have been most surprised by which finding?
Choices:
  A: No link was found between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions.
  B: After volunteers were asked to analyze a complicated political issue, their understanding of it did not increase.
  C: When volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
  D: When volunteers were asked questions about complex issues, those with the most extreme views were found to have the best overall understanding of them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage talks about Fernbach's laboratory experiments that aimed to investigate whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The passage mentions two experiments conducted by Fernbach and his colleagues:
    - In the first experiment, volunteers were asked to write elaborate explanations of two issues in detail. The volunteers who were asked to explain complex policies in detail became more moderate in their views.
    - In the second experiment, some volunteers merely listed reasons for liking a policy. Those who simply listed reasons for their positions were less shaken in their views.
  The passage does not mention any link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers' positions or that the volunteers' understanding of a complicated political issue did not increase.
  The passage does not mention that those with the most extreme views had the best overall understanding of complex issues.
  Therefore, the answer is C: When volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Fernbach's laboratory experiments that aimed to explore whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The passage explains that volunteers were recruited to state their positions on a variety of issues, and then asked to write elaborate explanations of two issues.
  The volunteers were not asked for value judgments about the policy or about the environment or business, but only for a highly detailed description of the mechanics of the policy in action.
  The passage explains that Fernbach's idea was that such an exercise would force many to realize just how little they really know about the issues, and confronted with their own ignorance, they would dampen their own enthusiasm.
  The passage also explains that being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a policy is not the same as trying to sell that policy, and that talking about one's views can often strengthen them.
  The passage concludes that polarization tends to reinforce itself, and that no simple measure will change that.
  Based on this information, the finding that Fernbach would have been most surprised by is that when volunteers were asked questions about complex issues, those with the most extreme views were found to have the best overall understanding of them.
  The passage does not mention this finding, and it contradicts the idea that forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would weaken their extremist stands on issues.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: A pair of recent studies suggests that although.industrialized nations may have benefitted from larger.cities, the same is not true for the rapidly urbanizing areas of.the developing world. In these parts of the globe, there really.might be such a thing as too much urbanization, too.quickly..The studies, by Susanne A. Frick and Andrés Rodríguez-.Pose of the London School of Economics, take a close look.at the actual connection between city size and nationwide.economic performance. Their initial study, from last year,.examines the relationship between economic development,.as measured by GDP per capita, and average metropolitan-.area size in 114 countries across the world between 1960.and 2010. To ensure robustness, it controls for variables.including national population size, physical land area,.education levels, economic openness, and other factors..The size of cities or metro areas across the world has.exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the.developing world growing much faster and much larger.than those in more developed nations. Between 1960 and 2010, the median city in high-income countries grew.modestly from 500,000 to 650,000 people; but the median.city in the developing world nearly quadrupled, expanding.from 220,000 to 845,000 people. In 1960, 12 of the top 20.countries with the largest average city size were high-.income countries; by 2010, 14 of the top 20 were in the.developing world..Urbanization has historically been thought of as a.necessary feature of economic development and growth, but.this study finds the connection is not so simple. While.advanced nations benefit from having larger cities,.developing nations do not. Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every.additional 100,000 in average population among its large.cities over a five-year period. But for developing nations, the.addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year.period..In their latest study, the researchers found that.developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck.from smaller and medium-size cities. These countries see.the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion.of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people.or less. Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic.impact in larger countries. Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic.benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million.or more, according to the study. This makes sense:.Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play.host to knowledge-based industries that require urban.agglomeration economies..There are several reasons why megacities^1 often fail to.spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world..For one, the lion’s share of places that are urbanizing.most rapidly today are in the poorest and least-.developed parts of the world, whereas the places that.urbanized a century or so ago were in the richest and.most developed. This history has created a false.expectation that urbanization is always associated with.prosperity..Additionally, globalization has severed the historical.connection between cities, local agriculture, and local.industry that powered the more balanced urban.economic development of the past. In today’s globally.interconnected economy, the raw materials that flowed.from the surrounding countryside to the city can all be.inexpensively imported from other parts of the world..The result is that the connection between large cities and.growth has now become much more tenuous, producing.a troubling new pattern of “urbanization without.growth.”.The researchers used multiple variables to calculate a weighted average.city size for each country studied and reported the median of those.averages..(^1) Typically defined as cities with populations of over ten million people

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."
Question: What can reasonably be inferred about the reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study?
Choices:
  A: The ibises were well acquainted with their migration route.
  B: Usherwood knew the ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration.
  C: The ibises have a body design that is similar to that of a modern airplane.
  D: The ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.

Topic: English
Context: Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie's eyes. Finally, she spoke.90 "I met him at my literary meeting."Naomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped."Mother.""Yes?"95 "I mean to have him."\begin{itemize}\item a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name\end{itemize}

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar. In 1789,.the French formed a new governmental body known as the.National Assembly, ushering in the tumultuous period of.political and social change known as the French Revolution..To make a government requires no great.prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach obedience,.and the work is done. To give freedom is still more.easy. It is not necessary to guide; it only requires to.let go the rein. But to form a free government, that is,.to temper together these opposite elements of liberty.and restraint in one consistent work, requires much.thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and.combining mind. This I do not find in those who.take the lead in the National Assembly. Perhaps they.are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather.believe it. It would put them below the common level.of human understanding. But when the leaders.choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of.popularity, their talents, in the construction of the.state, will be of no service. They will become.flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not.the guides, of the people. If any of them should.happen to propose a scheme of liberty, soberly.limited and defined with proper qualifications, he.will be immediately outbid by his competitors who.will produce something more splendidly popular..Suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause..Moderation will be stigmatized as the virtue of.cowards, and compromise as the prudence of.traitors, until, in hopes of preserving the credit which.may enable him to temper and moderate, on some.occasions, the popular leader is obliged to become.active in propagating doctrines and establishing.powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose.at which he ultimately might have aimed..But am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all.that deserves commendation in the indefatigable.labors of this Assembly? I do not deny that, among.an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, some.good may have been done. They who destroy.everything certainly will remove some grievance..They who make everything new have a chance that.they may establish something beneficial. To give.them credit for what they have done in virtue of the.authority they have usurped, or which can excuse.them in the crimes by which that authority has been.acquired, it must appear that the same things could.not have been accomplished without producing such.a revolution. Most assuredly they might....Some.usages have been abolished on just grounds, but.they were such that if they had stood as they were to.all eternity, they would little detract from the.happiness and prosperity of any state. The.improvements of the National Assembly are.superficial, their errors fundamental..Whatever they are, I wish my countrymen rather.to recommend to our neighbors the example of the.British constitution than to take models from them.for the improvement of our own. In the former, they.have got an invaluable treasure. They are not, I think,.without some causes of apprehension and complaint,.but these they do not owe to their constitution but to.their own conduct. I think our happy situation owing.to our constitution, but owing to the whole of it, and.not to any part singly, owing in a great measure to.what we have left standing in our several reviews and.reformations as well as to what we have altered or.superadded. Our people will find employment.enough for a truly patriotic, free, and independent.spirit in guarding what they possess from violation. I.would not exclude alteration neither, but even when.I changed, it should be to preserve. I should be led to.my remedy by a great grievance. In what I did, I.should follow the example of our ancestors. I would.make the reparation as nearly as possible in the style.of the building. A politic caution, a guarded.circumspection, a moral rather than a complexional.timidity were among the ruling principles of our.forefathers in their most decided conduct. Not being.illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of.France tell us they have got so abundant a share, they.acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and.fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus.fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct.attended to their nature. Let us imitate their caution.if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their.bequests. Let us add, if we please, but let us preserve.what they have left; and, standing on the firm ground.of the British constitution, let us be satisfied to.admire rather than attempt to follow in their.desperate flights the aeronauts of France.

Context: \section{Passage 1}Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a land whose coast lines would enclose half the  countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between 5 the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people that $\mathrm{He}$ has planted on this soil; a people sprung from the most masterful blood of history; a people perpetually revitalized by the virile ... working-folk10 of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes-the propagandists and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a15 history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future; a history of statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands ... a history of soldiers, who carried the flag20 across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a history of a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century ... a history divinely logical, in the process of whose tremendous 25 reasoning we find ourselves to-day....Think of the thousands of Americans who will pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the Republic's laws cover those islands with justice and safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans30 who will invade ... the Philippines when a liberal government ... shall establish order and equity there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who will build a . . civilization of energy and industry in Cuba, when a government of law35 replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!think of the prosperous millions that Empress of Islands will support when, obedient to the law of political gravitation, her people ask for the highest honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the40 Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great Republic!\section{Passage 2}If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the45 Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability.The Filipinos do not need any encouragement 50 from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated tomake the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, "Give me liberty or give me death," he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.60 Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.$65 \mathrm{Or}$, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are 70 forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or 75 spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so80 low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also85 calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: It is well known that some animal species use.camouflage to hide from predators. Individuals that.are able to blend in to their surroundings and avoid.being eaten are able to survive longer, reproduce, and.thus increase their fitness (pass along their genes to.the next generation) compared to those who stand.out more. This may seem like a good strategy, and.fairly common in the animal kingdom, but who ever.heard of a plant doing the same thing?.In plants, the use of coloration or pigmentation as.a vital component of acquiring food (e.g.,.photosynthesis) or as a means of attracting.pollinators (e.g., flowers) has been well studied..However, variation in pigmentation as a means of.escaping predation has received little attention..Matthew Klooster from Harvard University and.colleagues empirically investigated whether the dried.bracts (specialized leaves) on a rare woodland plant,.Monotropsis odorata, might serve a similar purpose.as the stripes on a tiger or the grey coloration of the.wings of the peppered moth: namely, to hide..“Monotropsis odoratais a fascinating plant.species, as it relies exclusively upon mycorrhizal.fungus, that associates with its roots, for all of the.resources it needs to live,” notes Klooster. “Because.this plant no longer requires photosynthetic.pigmentation (i.e., green coloration) to produce its.own energy, it is free to adopt a broader range of.possibilities in coloration, much like fungi or.animals.”.Using a large population ofMonotropsis odorata,.Klooster and colleagues experimentally removed the.dried bracts that cover the 3- to 5-cm tall stems and.flower buds of these woodland plants. The bracts are.a brown color that resembles the leaf litter from.which the reproductive stems emerge and cover the.pinkish-purple colored buds and deep purple stems..When Klooster and colleagues measured the.reflectance pattern (the percentage of light reflected.at various wavelengths) of the different plant parts,.they indeed found that the bracts functioned as.camouflage, making the plant blend in with its.surroundings; the bract reflectance pattern closely.resembled that of the leaf litter, and both differed.from that of the reproductive stem and flowers.hidden underneath the bracts. Furthermore, they.experimentally demonstrated that this camouflage.actually worked to hide the plant from its predators.and increased its fitness. Individuals with intact.bracts suffered only a quarter of the herbivore.damage and produced a higher percentage of mature.fruits compared to those whose bracts were removed..“It has long been shown that animals use cryptic.coloration (camouflage) as a defense mechanism to.visually match a component of their natural.environment, which facilitates predator avoidance,”.Klooster said. “We have now experimentally.demonstrated that plants have evolved a similar.strategy to avoid their herbivores.”.Drying its bracts early to hide its reproductive.parts is a good strategy when the stems are exposed.to predators for long periods of time: all the other.species in the subfamily Monotropoideae have.colorful fleshy bracts and are reproductively active.for only a quarter of the length of time. Somewhat.paradoxically, however,Monotropsis odorataactually.relies on animals for pollination and seed dispersal..How does it accomplish this when it is disguised as.dead leaf material and is able to hide so well? The.authors hypothesize that the flowers emit highly.fragrant odors that serve to attract pollinators and.seed dispersal agents; indeed they observed bumble.bees finding and pollinating many reproductive.stems that were entirely hidden by the leaf litter itself.

  Matthew Klooster and colleagues investigated whether a rare woodland plant, Monotropsis odorata, used camouflage to hide from predators.
  The study found that the dried bracts of Monotropsis odorata functioned as camouflage, making the plant blend in with its surroundings.
  The study found that individuals with intact bracts suffered less herbivore damage and produced a higher percentage of mature fruits compared to those whose bracts were removed.
  Therefore, the passage indicates that compared with other functions of coloration in plants, camouflage in plants has received less attention.

Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.Let every American, every lover of liberty, every.well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the.Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,.the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their.violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did.to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so.to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every.American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred.honor;—let every man remember that to violate the.law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to.tear the character of his own, and his children’s.liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by.every American mother, to the lisping babe, that.prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in.seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in.Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be.preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative.halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,.let it become thepolitical religionof the nation;.and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,.the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and.colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its.altars.....When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of.all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there.are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,.for the redress of which, no legal provisions have.been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do.mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,.should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they.continue in force, for the sake of example, they.should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided.cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be.made for them with the least possible delay; but, till.then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with..There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress.by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,.the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two.positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right.within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of.all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and.therefore proper to be prohibited by legal.enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition.of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable..Passage 2.Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey.them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey.them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress.them at once? Men generally, under such a.government as this, think that they ought to wait.until they have persuaded the majority to alter them..They think that, if they should resist, the remedy.would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the.government itself that the remedy is worse than the.evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to.anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not.cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist.before it is hurt?....If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of.the machine of government, let it go, let it go;.perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the.machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or.a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,.then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy.will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a.nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice.to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be.a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have.to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to.the wrong which I condemn..As for adopting the ways which the State has.provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such.ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will.be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into.this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to.live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has.not everything to do, but something; and because he.cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he.should do something wrong.....I do not hesitate to say, that those who call.themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually.withdraw their support, both in person and property,.from the government...andnotwait till they.constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the.right to prevail through them. I think that it is.enough if they have God on their side, without.waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more.right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one.already.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: Based on Passage 2, Meltzer and his team relied on what evidence to challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis?
Choices:
  A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact
  B: The discovery of additional Clovis artifacts in a host of sites besides the 29 initially identified
  C: Analyses showing that nanodiamonds can occur in geologic formations lacking indications of extraterrestrial impacts
  D: High concentrations of iridium that have been found in sedimentary layers beneath the proposed impact layer

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.

The researchers made half the plants more fragrant by adding dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers. 
The treated flower emitted about 45 times more fragrance than a normal one. 
The researchers wanted to see if extra beetles would impose a double cost by both damaging flowers and deterring bees.
The pollination of hand-pollinated flowers would provide a benchmark to see whether the fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles resulted in reduced pollination. 
The results showed that double the normal number of beetles were present on fragrance-enhanced blossoms. 
The pollinators were indifferent to the highly scented flowers. 
The gourds that developed from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had, on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal flowers. 
The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent.
Therefore, the answer is C: increased their floral scent. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
The article mentions that the Texas gourd vine's main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent. 
The researchers were testing whether increasing the floral scent would attract more pollinators or if it would attract more beetles. 
The article mentions that intuition suggests that more of that aroma should be even more appealing to bees. 
Therefore, the answer is C: increased their floral scent. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The article discusses an experiment on how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles.
  The Texas gourd vine's main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent.
  The aroma includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant - and the only one that lures squash bees into traps - is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
  The researchers made half the plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers.
  Each treated flower emitted about 45 times more fragrance than a normal one.
  The researchers wanted to know whether extra scent could well call in more beetles too.
  The author indicates that it seems initially plausible that Texas gourd plants could attract more pollinators if they increased their floral scent.
  Therefore, the answer is C: increased their floral scent.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, "Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."40 He picked up a bird shape: "Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought." He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: "Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind."As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. "Look here," Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. "See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this." And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. "The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price."I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.
Question: In Passage 1, Beecher makes which point about the status of women relative to that of men?
Choices:
  A: Women depend on men for their safety and security, but men are largely independent of women.
  B: Women are inferior to men, but women play a role as significant as that played by men.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.
Question: Which choice best describes the ways that the two authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society?

Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, in studying the Venus flytrap, Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of which type of evidence?
Choices:
  A: Mathematical models to predict the electrical charge required to close the Venus flytrap
  B: Analysis of data collected from previous researchers' work involving the Venus flytrap's response to electricity
  C: Information obtained from monitoring the Venus flytrap's response to varying amounts of electrical current

In 1893 the name of Louis Comfort Tiffany.will be on the lips of millions!” He stood up and swung open.his arms wide enough to embrace the whole world..I sensed his open palm somewhere in the air behind the.small of my back, ushering me to his massive, carved.mahogany exhibit table to see his sketches and watercolors..“Two round windows, The Infancy of Christ and Botticelli’s.Madonna and Child, will be set off by a dozen scenic side.windows.”.A huge undertaking. How richly fortunate. Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together, to a house divided against itself, and says that it is  contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.When did he learn, and by what authority does he proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased fromfour millions to thirty millions of people; we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population,in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under aConstitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says isin violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government....I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of eachState to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-boundRepublic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire newterritory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just 45 as fast and as far as we need the territory... .\section{Passage 2}In complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship ... he again quotes that portion in which I said that "a house divided 50 against itself cannot stand." Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face55 of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate60 the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the65 house a "house divided against itself." They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?70 Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has75 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.The brains of humans are conspicuously larger than the.brains of other apes, but the human-specific genetic.factors responsible for the uniquely large human.neocortex remain obscure. Since humans split from.chimps, which have brains roughly a third of human size,.the human genome has undergone roughly 15 million.changes. Which of these genetic tweaks could have led to.big brains?.About six years ago, scientists in David Haussler’s lab at.Howard Hughes Medical Institute discovered a gene called.NOTCH2NL. It’s a relative of NOTCH2, a gene that.scientists knew was central to early brain development..NOTCH2 controls vital decisions regarding when and how.many neurons to make..When the Haussler team looked in the official version.of the human genome at that time^1 —version 37—.NOTCH2NL appeared to be located in chromosome 1.near a region linked to abnormal brain size. Delete a hunk.of the region, and brains tend to shrink. Duplicate part of.it, and brains tend to overgrow..“We thought, ‘Oh, this is incredible,’” Haussler said..NOTCH2NL seemed to check all the boxes for a key role.in human brain development. But when the team mapped.NOTCH2NL’s precise location in the genome, they.discovered the gene wasn’t actually in the relevant.chromosomal region after all; the once-promising.candidate seemed to be a dud..“We were downhearted,” Haussler recalled. That all.changed with the next official version of the human.genome—version 38. In this iteration, NOTCH2NL was.located in the crucial region. “And there were three.versions of it,” Haussler exclaimed. Over the last three.million years, his team calculated, NOTCH2NL was.repeatedly copy-pasted into the genome, what he calls “a.series of genetic accidents.”.Genetic analysis of several primate species revealed that.the three genes exist only in humans and their recent.relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, not in.chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. What’s more, the.timing of these genes’ emergence matches up with the.period in the fossil record when our ancestors’ craniums.began to enlarge, Haussler points out. Together, the results.suggest that NOTCH2NL genes played a role in beefing.up human brain size..Passage 2.Modern humans have brains that are more than three.times larger than our closest living relatives,.chimpanzees and bonobos. Scientists don’t agree on.when and how this dramatic increase took place, but.new analysis of 94 hominin fossils shows that average.brain size increased gradually and consistently over the.past three million years..The research, published in The Proceedings of the.Royal Society B, shows that the trend was caused.primarily by evolution of larger brains within.populations of individual species, but the introduction of.new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones also played a part..“Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that.makes us human. It’s related to cultural complexity,.language, tool making and all these other things that.make us unique,” said Andrew Du, PhD, a postdoctoral.scholar at the University of Chicago and first author of.the study. “The earliest hominins had brain sizes like.chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since.then. So, it’s important to understand how we got here.”.Du and his colleagues compared published research.data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13.different species, beginning with the earliest.unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3.2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including.Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size.began to overlap with that of modern-day humans..The researchers saw that when the species were.counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a.common ancestor, the average brain size increased.gradually over three million years. Looking more closely,.the increase was driven by three different factors,.primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within.individual species populations, but also by the addition.of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones..The study quantifies for the first time when and by.how much each of these factors contributes to the clade-.level pattern. Du said he likens it to how a football coach.might build a roster of bigger, strong players. One way.would be to make all the players hit the weight room to.bulk up. But the coach could also recruit new, larger.players and cut the smallest ones..(^1) The reference version of the human genome goes through updates to.more completely map out each chromosomal sequence.

Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these "low-threshold" nerves "C-tactile," or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their "exquisite sensitivity" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: A pair of recent studies suggests that although.industrialized nations may have benefitted from larger.cities, the same is not true for the rapidly urbanizing areas of.the developing world. In these parts of the globe, there really.might be such a thing as too much urbanization, too.quickly..The studies, by Susanne A. Frick and Andrés Rodríguez-.Pose of the London School of Economics, take a close look.at the actual connection between city size and nationwide.economic performance. Their initial study, from last year,.examines the relationship between economic development,.as measured by GDP per capita, and average metropolitan-.area size in 114 countries across the world between 1960.and 2010. To ensure robustness, it controls for variables.including national population size, physical land area,.education levels, economic openness, and other factors..The size of cities or metro areas across the world has.exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the.developing world growing much faster and much larger.than those in more developed nations. Between 1960 and 2010, the median city in high-income countries grew.modestly from 500,000 to 650,000 people; but the median.city in the developing world nearly quadrupled, expanding.from 220,000 to 845,000 people. In 1960, 12 of the top 20.countries with the largest average city size were high-.income countries; by 2010, 14 of the top 20 were in the.developing world..Urbanization has historically been thought of as a.necessary feature of economic development and growth, but.this study finds the connection is not so simple. While.advanced nations benefit from having larger cities,.developing nations do not. Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every.additional 100,000 in average population among its large.cities over a five-year period. But for developing nations, the.addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year.period..In their latest study, the researchers found that.developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck.from smaller and medium-size cities. These countries see.the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion.of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people.or less. Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic.impact in larger countries. Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic.benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million.or more, according to the study. This makes sense:.Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play.host to knowledge-based industries that require urban.agglomeration economies..There are several reasons why megacities^1 often fail to.spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world..For one, the lion’s share of places that are urbanizing.most rapidly today are in the poorest and least-.developed parts of the world, whereas the places that.urbanized a century or so ago were in the richest and.most developed. This history has created a false.expectation that urbanization is always associated with.prosperity..Additionally, globalization has severed the historical.connection between cities, local agriculture, and local.industry that powered the more balanced urban.economic development of the past. In today’s globally.interconnected economy, the raw materials that flowed.from the surrounding countryside to the city can all be.inexpensively imported from other parts of the world..The result is that the connection between large cities and.growth has now become much more tenuous, producing.a troubling new pattern of “urbanization without.growth.”.The researchers used multiple variables to calculate a weighted average.city size for each country studied and reported the median of those.averages..(^1) Typically defined as cities with populations of over ten million people

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: Based on the passage, the researchers’ conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that
Choices:
  A: no genetic variations were common to all those finches that were not also common to all the finches that did not use that technique.
  B: those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
  C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
  D: there is probably not a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of that technique and its prior transmission to those finches.
Response 0:
Thought:
The question is asking about the researchers' conclusion regarding the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique. 
The passage explains that these birds developed a new technique for tool use that deviated from the typical tool-using behavior that was seen in the wild, and that this technique was learned through individual learning. 
The passage also explains that the birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice. 
Therefore, the fact that the novel technique was developed through individual learning is supported in part by the difficulty for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The researchers observed that five individuals developed a tool-using technique that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild.
  These birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice.
  After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.
  The researchers concluded that the ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is determined by a very specific genetic component, but is enhanced through individual learning.
  Therefore, the answer is likely an option that indicates that the individual learning played a role in the development of this technique.
  Option A is incorrect because it does not provide any information related to the development of the technique.
  Option B is incorrect because it talks about the researchers altering the artificial crevices, which is not related to the development of the technique.
  Option D is incorrect because it is making a statement about a naturally occurring circumstance, which is not related to the development of the technique.
  Option C is correct because it states that the portion of the technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially. This suggests that the finches likely developed the technique through individual learning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The researchers found that five woodpecker finches developed a novel levering technique during the study that deviated from typical tool-using behavior.
  The researchers concluded that this individual learning enhanced the ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior.
  The passage provides evidence to support this conclusion.
  Therefore, the answer is one of the choices that provides such evidence.
  Choice A is not relevant to the conclusion about individual learning and genetic component.
  Choice B is not relevant to the evidence that the finches displayed individual learning.
  Choice D is not relevant to the evidence that the finches displayed individual learning.
  Choice C is relevant because it suggests that the novel technique was not acquired socially because it took place inside a crevice and was difficult for other finches to observe.
  Therefore, the answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that the five woodpecker finches that developed the levering technique deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild.
  The technique was developed because the birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice.
  The five birds significantly increased their use of this method after initial success with this technique.
  The passage also mentions that individual learning plays an important role during the ontogeny of tool use in serving to improve the efficiency of this behavior.
  Therefore, the researchers’ conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that the five birds significantly increased their use of this method after initial success with this technique.
  The answer is B: Those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage states that the young woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to watch tool use develop this ability with similar aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were given the chance to observe tool use in adult woodpecker finches. Therefore, it is clear that the woodpecker finches can develop tool-oriented behavior through individual learning.
  The passage states that five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild, most likely because the artificial crevices differed from natural crevices and tree holes. The five birds significantly increased their use of this method after initial success with this technique.
  Therefore, the researchers’ conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that this technique deviates from typical tool-using behavior and it was developed by the birds themselves.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how some woodpecker finches developed a new tool-using technique that differed from the tool use performed by birds in the wild.
  The researchers concluded that non-social, individual learning played an important role in the development of this new technique.
  The question asks for evidence to support the researchers' conclusion.
  Therefore, we need to find a statement that supports that the new levering technique was learned individually.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how five individual woodpecker finches developed a new tool-using technique that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild.
  The researchers concluded that this development of a new technique was an example of individual learning.
  The passage also states that the woodpecker finches are solitary and that reliance on social transmission from parents to offspring during an association would be a highly risky endeavor.
  The passage suggests that the individual learning of tool use in woodpecker finches is enhanced through individual learning.
  Therefore, the answer is C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The researchers found that young woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to watch tool use develop this ability with similar aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were given the chance to observe tool use in adult woodpecker finches.
  The researchers concluded that the developmental process seems to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components but enhanced through individual learning.
  The researchers found that five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild, most likely because our artificial crevices differed from natural crevices and tree holes.
  After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.
  Therefore, the researchers’ conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that the finches significantly increased their use of this method.
  The answer is B: those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The researchers' conclusion is that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning.
  The passage states that the five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild.
  The passage also states that the novel technique was most likely developed because the artificial crevices differed from natural crevices and tree holes.
  The passage further states that after initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.
  Therefore, the fact that the novel technique was developed due to the artificial crevices differing from natural crevices and tree holes, and that the birds increased their use of this method after initial success, supports the researchers' conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how five individual woodpecker finches developed a novel tool-using technique that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The news is a form of public knowledge..Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the.health of one’s friends and family; the conduct of a.Line private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge.increases in value as it is shared by more people. The.date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;.the causes and consequences of an environmental.disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular.law; the latest reports from a war zone—these are all.examples of public knowledge that people are.generally expected to know in order to be considered.informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or.private knowledge, which is generally left to.individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is.promoted even to those who might not think it.matters to them. In short, the circulation of public.knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded.as a public good which cannot be solely.demand-driven..The production, circulation, and reception.of public knowledge is a complex process. It is.generally accepted that public knowledge should.be authoritative, but there is not always.common agreement about what the public needs to.know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and.how authoritative reputations should be determined.and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The.Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely.regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative.agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied.the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of.authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the.opinions of others.” As part of the general process of.the transformation of authority whereby there has.been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional.sources of public knowledge, the demand has been.for all authority to make explicit the frames of value.which determine their decisions. Centres of news.production, as our focus groups show, have not been.exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps.some news journalists feel uneasy about this.renegotiation of their authority:.Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the.“most read” lists on their own and other websites.to work out which stories matter to readers and.viewers. And now the audience—which used to.know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of.journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our.credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008)..The result of democratising access to TV news.could be political disengagement by the majority.and a dumbing down through a popularity.contest of stories (online news editor, 2007)..Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,.they amount to more than straightforward.professional defensiveness. In their reference to an.audience “which used to know its place” and.conflation between democratisation and “dumbing.down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular.mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by.experts, immune from populist pressures; and.disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive.recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down.opportunities for popular involvement in the making.of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional.claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are.right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every.institutional level in contemporary society,.scepticism towards the epistemological authority of.expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed.by several of our focus group participants, that the.news media should be “informative rather than.authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to.“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their.slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient.information” from which “we would be able to form.opinions of our own.”.At stake here are two distinct conceptions of.authority. The journalists we have quoted are.resistant to the democratisation of news:.the supremacy of the clickstream (according to.which editors raise or lower the profile of stories.according to the number of readers clicking on them.online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”.news; the demands of some audience members for.raw news rather than constructed narratives.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,.but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the.doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The.poor market may be slowing innovation, but.advances continue; judging by the mood this week at.the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in.Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain.optimistic about its long-term prospects..The technology that’s surprised almost everyone.is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and.Martin Green, professor at the University of.New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar.panel researchers, declared that they’d never go.below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per.watt,” he says..The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of.reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar.panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020..Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target.even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the.direct cost of solar power to six cents per.kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost.expected for power from new natural gas power.plants..All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have.been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the.power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady.cost reductions. Green points to something as.mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of.the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar.cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon.solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To.achieve that record, he had to use expensive.lithography techniques to make fine wires for.collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual.improvements have made it possible to use screen.printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research.suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce.lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of.the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at.costs far lower than his lithography techniques..Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable.Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a.new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,.which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar.cell they made is the only current challenger to.silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film.cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower.the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power.cheaper..One of Green’s former students and colleagues,.Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer.China Sunergy, announced this week that he is.building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided.solar cell that can absorb light from both the front.and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that.during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the.land between rows of solar panels in a solar power.plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels.and could be harvested to increase the power output..This works particularly well when the solar panels.are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a.one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a.two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He.expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more.electricity over the course of a year..Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,.aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in.cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to.greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels.by combining silicon with one or two other.semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a.part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert.efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost.efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to.around 40 percent. Adding another could make.efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which.would cut in half the number of solar panels needed.for a given installation. The challenge is to produce.good connections between these semiconductors,.something made challenging by the arrangement of.silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden  with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are 5 the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the10 procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those15 doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty20 years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that25 makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively30 no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us35 then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old40 family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so 45 long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The0 questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that55 procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will60 object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men65 have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our70 brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the75 gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this "civilization" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in80 them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.
Question: Which choice best summarizes the passage?
Choices:
  A: A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job.

Topic: English
Context: Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie's eyes. Finally, she spoke.90 "I met him at my literary meeting."Naomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped."Mother.""Yes?"95 "I mean to have him."\begin{itemize}\item a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name\end{itemize}

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,.but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the.doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The.poor market may be slowing innovation, but.advances continue; judging by the mood this week at.the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in.Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain.optimistic about its long-term prospects..The technology that’s surprised almost everyone.is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and.Martin Green, professor at the University of.New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar.panel researchers, declared that they’d never go.below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per.watt,” he says..The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of.reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar.panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020..Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target.even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the.direct cost of solar power to six cents per.kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost.expected for power from new natural gas power.plants..All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have.been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the.power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady.cost reductions. Green points to something as.mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of.the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar.cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon.solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To.achieve that record, he had to use expensive.lithography techniques to make fine wires for.collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual.improvements have made it possible to use screen.printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research.suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce.lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of.the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at.costs far lower than his lithography techniques..Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable.Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a.new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,.which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar.cell they made is the only current challenger to.silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film.cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower.the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power.cheaper..One of Green’s former students and colleagues,.Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer.China Sunergy, announced this week that he is.building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided.solar cell that can absorb light from both the front.and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that.during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the.land between rows of solar panels in a solar power.plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels.and could be harvested to increase the power output..This works particularly well when the solar panels.are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a.one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a.two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He.expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more.electricity over the course of a year..Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,.aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in.cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to.greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels.by combining silicon with one or two other.semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a.part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert.efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost.efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to.around 40 percent. Adding another could make.efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which.would cut in half the number of solar panels needed.for a given installation. The challenge is to produce.good connections between these semiconductors,.something made challenging by the arrangement of.silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.
Question: The narrator indicates that Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola are

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land  where they were born; and that they areproperty-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose ofall these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a 15 greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction.Any other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women's20 interest to change the assignment they have received.It seems to us incontestable that our common happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in25 the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the30 home? And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a35 manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life's companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand 40 that the good of all demands this of you.\section{Passage 2}Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of45 knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her50 reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an55 orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations....Consider, sir, dispassionately, these60 observations-for a glimpse of this truth seemed to open before you when you observed, "that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it65 was impossible to explain." If so, on what does your constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this70 country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman-prescription.Consider-I address you as a legislatorwhether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their75 own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift 80 of reason?In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination, from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be 85 useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark?

They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.
Question: Which statement about striped cucumber beetles can most reasonably be inferred from the passage?
Choices:
  A: They feed primarily on Texas gourd plants.
  B: They are less attracted to dimethoxybenzene than honey bees are.
  C: They experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease.
  D: They are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with tables for two along the walls and tables for four  down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,except for the series of murals depicting the four seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window. Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash register, and ordered his dinner. The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass 10 sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other15 page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears.While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed 20 on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of25 Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in November of the same year, and all the powers engaged in the war on either side sent plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and important assembly ever convoked to discuss and 30 determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and 35 began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma, thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his right thumb) presided over the Congress, and40 Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented France.A party of four, two men and two women, came into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took possession of the center table nearest Lymie.45 The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts which exposed the underside of their knees when they sat down. One of the women had the face of a young boy but disguised by one trick or another (rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against 50 the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for, while they were deciding between soup and shrimp 55 cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was the women's voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women's voices which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them. Fortunately he realized this and went back. 60 Otherwise he might never have known about the secret treaty concluded between England, France, and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress65 were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at the top of page 68 , but before Lymie got halfway through them, a coat that he recognized as his father's was hung on the hook next to his chair. Lymie closed the book and said, "I didn't think you 70 were coming."Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his75 scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button.80 Apparently he himself was not aware that there had been any change. He straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth85 finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of 90 the moon. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.
Question: According to Passage 2, the wild tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed as a result of which factor?
Choices:
  A: Generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out what effect, if any, all that driving around the  labyrinthine streets of London might have oncabbies' brains. When she brought sixteen taxi drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an MRI scanner, she found one surprising and important difference. The right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain known to beinvolved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in the cabbies-a small but very significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of that way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains. The moreyears a cabbie had been on the road, the more pronounced the effect.The brain is a mutable organ, capable-within limits-of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known asneuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons-that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain's basic anatomical structurewas more or less static. Maguire's study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.After her groundbreaking study of London cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to mental athletes. She teamed up with ElizabethValentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic monograph Superior Memory, to study ten individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were-like the Londoncabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners  and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it was possible that they might discover anatomical 45 differences in the brains of the memory champs, evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized themselves in the process of doing all that intensive remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the imaging data, not a single significant structural50 difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects. What's more, on every single test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes' scores came back well within the normal range. The 55 memory champs weren't smarter, and they didn't have special brains.But there was one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects: When the researchers looked at which parts of the 60 brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry. According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be 65 working in overdrive for the mental athletes.Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial70 navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first glance, this wouldn't seem to make any sense. Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in 75 their mind's eye when they were trying to learn three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating like London cabbies when they're supposed to be remembering the shapes of snowflakes?Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes 80 to describe exactly what was going through their minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said they were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, and distributing those images along familiar spatial85 journeys. They weren't doing this automatically, or because it was an inborn talent they'd nurtured since childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural activity that Maguire's fMRIs turned up were the result of training and practice

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Large competitors are often viewed as a major.threat for startups and small companies; big.companies have more financial resources and greater.scale, market power and brand awareness than.smaller ones. However, our research finds that a.smaller brand can actually benefit if consumers can.see the competitive threat it faces from a larger.organization..When a U.S.-based ice cream chain with about 1,400 stores moved within 50 steps of a J.P. Licks ice.cream store in Newton, Massachusetts, some people.expected that J.P. Licks, a small, locally owned.company, would be beaten out of the Newton market..But consumers rallied around J.P. Licks, and the.national chain later closed its nearby location. When.the owner of the Los Angeles-based coffee store chain.The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf could not stop a large.coffee shop chain from moving in next door, he was.surprised to see his sales shoot up—so much so that.he started proactively colocating new stores next to.large chain ones..These examples are not anomalies. In six lab and.field studies, we explored the effects of having a large,.dominant competitor and found that highlighting a.large competitor’s size and close proximity can help.smaller brands, instead of harming them. Compared.to when they are in competition with brands that are.similar to them in size or when consumers view them.outside of a competitive context, small brands see.consumer support go up when they are faced with a.competitive threat from large brands. This support.translates into higher purchase intention, more.purchases and more favorable online reviews..As part of our research, we conducted a field study.at an independent bookstore in Cambridge,.Massachusetts. Upon entering the bookstore, 163.prospective shoppers were exposed to one of three.versions of an in-store ad, emphasizing either the.store’s large competitors, small competitors or no.competition. Shoppers who read the “large.competitors” version were told that the store’s main.competitors are large corporations that have the.ability to put small businesses such as this bookstore.out of business. The “small competitors” version.indicated the store’s main competitors are other.locally owned small bookstores in Cambridge. In the.“no competition” version, participants were given no.information about the competitive environment..Shoppers were then given a $5 coupon, coded with.the in-store ad version they read. Analyzing.shoppers’ sales receipts and the number of redeemed.coupons, we found that shoppers were significantly.more likely to make a purchase after reading the.“large competitors” version of the in-store ad,.compared to the “small competitors” version or the.“no competition” version. They also purchased more.items and spent more money at the store, compared.to shoppers reading the “small competitors” or “no.competition” versions. These results suggest that.framing the competitive game and emphasizing a.competitive narrative against a larger company can.help a small establishment—and spur consumers to.make a purchase that supports the smaller.competitor..In subsequent studies, we tested this “framing-.the-game” effect in various contexts and product.categories and further found that support for a large.brand decreases when consumers view it as being in.competition with a smaller brand. In one study, we.asked participants to assess two hypothetical rival tire.shops, “Tire World” and “Tire Planet,” under three.conditions—small vs. large, small vs. small or large.vs. large competitors. While participants indicated no.preference for the small or large shop when it was.competing against a competitor of similar size, the.small vs. large competitive context elicited a strong.preference for the small rather than large shop.

Choices:
  A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together, to a house divided against itself, and says that it is  contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.When did he learn, and by what authority does he proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased fromfour millions to thirty millions of people; we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population,in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under aConstitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says isin violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government....I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of eachState to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-boundRepublic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire newterritory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just 45 as fast and as far as we need the territory... .\section{Passage 2}In complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship ... he again quotes that portion in which I said that "a house divided 50 against itself cannot stand." Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face55 of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate60 the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the65 house a "house divided against itself." They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?70 Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has75 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
Question: 80 with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now. Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there has been agitation and resistance.... Do you think that the nature of man will be changed, that the same 85 causes that produced agitation at one time will not have the same effect at another?

  A: provide context for Douglas's defense of continued expansion.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their  parents. "They jumped up like popcorn," he said, 5 describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. "He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. "I asked 35 him how it went," Ken recalled, "and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' " Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the "aha" moment. "The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively," he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. "It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car," he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)
Question: Which statement best captures Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research?
Choices:
  A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
  B: The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior.
  C: Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest.
  D: Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel.

It is a mighty people that $\mathrm{He}$ has planted on this soil; a people sprung from the most masterful blood of history; a people perpetually revitalized by the virile ... working-folk10 of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes-the propagandists and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a15 history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future; a history of statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands ... a history of soldiers, who carried the flag20 across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a history of a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century ... a history divinely logical, in the process of whose tremendous 25 reasoning we find ourselves to-day....Think of the thousands of Americans who will pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the Republic's laws cover those islands with justice and safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans30 who will invade ... the Philippines when a liberal government ... shall establish order and equity there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who will build a . . civilization of energy and industry in Cuba, when a government of law35 replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!think of the prosperous millions that Empress of Islands will support when, obedient to the law of political gravitation, her people ask for the highest honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the40 Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great Republic!\section{Passage 2}If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the45 Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability.The Filipinos do not need any encouragement 50 from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated tomake the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, "Give me liberty or give me death," he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.60 Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.$65 \mathrm{Or}$, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are 70 forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or 75 spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so80 low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also85 calculate its effects upon our own nation.

Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.The brains of humans are conspicuously larger than the.brains of other apes, but the human-specific genetic.factors responsible for the uniquely large human.neocortex remain obscure. Since humans split from.chimps, which have brains roughly a third of human size,.the human genome has undergone roughly 15 million.changes. Which of these genetic tweaks could have led to.big brains?.About six years ago, scientists in David Haussler’s lab at.Howard Hughes Medical Institute discovered a gene called.NOTCH2NL. It’s a relative of NOTCH2, a gene that.scientists knew was central to early brain development..NOTCH2 controls vital decisions regarding when and how.many neurons to make..When the Haussler team looked in the official version.of the human genome at that time^1 —version 37—.NOTCH2NL appeared to be located in chromosome 1.near a region linked to abnormal brain size. Delete a hunk.of the region, and brains tend to shrink. Duplicate part of.it, and brains tend to overgrow..“We thought, ‘Oh, this is incredible,’” Haussler said..NOTCH2NL seemed to check all the boxes for a key role.in human brain development. But when the team mapped.NOTCH2NL’s precise location in the genome, they.discovered the gene wasn’t actually in the relevant.chromosomal region after all; the once-promising.candidate seemed to be a dud..“We were downhearted,” Haussler recalled. That all.changed with the next official version of the human.genome—version 38. In this iteration, NOTCH2NL was.located in the crucial region. “And there were three.versions of it,” Haussler exclaimed. Over the last three.million years, his team calculated, NOTCH2NL was.repeatedly copy-pasted into the genome, what he calls “a.series of genetic accidents.”.Genetic analysis of several primate species revealed that.the three genes exist only in humans and their recent.relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, not in.chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. What’s more, the.timing of these genes’ emergence matches up with the.period in the fossil record when our ancestors’ craniums.began to enlarge, Haussler points out. Together, the results.suggest that NOTCH2NL genes played a role in beefing.up human brain size..Passage 2.Modern humans have brains that are more than three.times larger than our closest living relatives,.chimpanzees and bonobos. Scientists don’t agree on.when and how this dramatic increase took place, but.new analysis of 94 hominin fossils shows that average.brain size increased gradually and consistently over the.past three million years..The research, published in The Proceedings of the.Royal Society B, shows that the trend was caused.primarily by evolution of larger brains within.populations of individual species, but the introduction of.new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones also played a part..“Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that.makes us human. It’s related to cultural complexity,.language, tool making and all these other things that.make us unique,” said Andrew Du, PhD, a postdoctoral.scholar at the University of Chicago and first author of.the study. “The earliest hominins had brain sizes like.chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since.then. So, it’s important to understand how we got here.”.Du and his colleagues compared published research.data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13.different species, beginning with the earliest.unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3.2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including.Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size.began to overlap with that of modern-day humans..The researchers saw that when the species were.counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a.common ancestor, the average brain size increased.gradually over three million years. Looking more closely,.the increase was driven by three different factors,.primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within.individual species populations, but also by the addition.of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones..The study quantifies for the first time when and by.how much each of these factors contributes to the clade-.level pattern. Du said he likens it to how a football coach.might build a roster of bigger, strong players. One way.would be to make all the players hit the weight room to.bulk up. But the coach could also recruit new, larger.players and cut the smallest ones..(^1) The reference version of the human genome goes through updates to.more completely map out each chromosomal sequence.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.

Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar. In 1789,.the French formed a new governmental body known as the.National Assembly, ushering in the tumultuous period of.political and social change known as the French Revolution..To make a government requires no great.prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach obedience,.and the work is done. To give freedom is still more.easy. It is not necessary to guide; it only requires to.let go the rein. But to form a free government, that is,.to temper together these opposite elements of liberty.and restraint in one consistent work, requires much.thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and.combining mind. This I do not find in those who.take the lead in the National Assembly. Perhaps they.are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather.believe it. It would put them below the common level.of human understanding. But when the leaders.choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of.popularity, their talents, in the construction of the.state, will be of no service. They will become.flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not.the guides, of the people. If any of them should.happen to propose a scheme of liberty, soberly.limited and defined with proper qualifications, he.will be immediately outbid by his competitors who.will produce something more splendidly popular..Suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause..Moderation will be stigmatized as the virtue of.cowards, and compromise as the prudence of.traitors, until, in hopes of preserving the credit which.may enable him to temper and moderate, on some.occasions, the popular leader is obliged to become.active in propagating doctrines and establishing.powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose.at which he ultimately might have aimed..But am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all.that deserves commendation in the indefatigable.labors of this Assembly? I do not deny that, among.an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, some.good may have been done. They who destroy.everything certainly will remove some grievance..They who make everything new have a chance that.they may establish something beneficial. To give.them credit for what they have done in virtue of the.authority they have usurped, or which can excuse.them in the crimes by which that authority has been.acquired, it must appear that the same things could.not have been accomplished without producing such.a revolution. Most assuredly they might....Some.usages have been abolished on just grounds, but.they were such that if they had stood as they were to.all eternity, they would little detract from the.happiness and prosperity of any state. The.improvements of the National Assembly are.superficial, their errors fundamental..Whatever they are, I wish my countrymen rather.to recommend to our neighbors the example of the.British constitution than to take models from them.for the improvement of our own. In the former, they.have got an invaluable treasure. They are not, I think,.without some causes of apprehension and complaint,.but these they do not owe to their constitution but to.their own conduct. I think our happy situation owing.to our constitution, but owing to the whole of it, and.not to any part singly, owing in a great measure to.what we have left standing in our several reviews and.reformations as well as to what we have altered or.superadded. Our people will find employment.enough for a truly patriotic, free, and independent.spirit in guarding what they possess from violation. I.would not exclude alteration neither, but even when.I changed, it should be to preserve. I should be led to.my remedy by a great grievance. In what I did, I.should follow the example of our ancestors. I would.make the reparation as nearly as possible in the style.of the building. A politic caution, a guarded.circumspection, a moral rather than a complexional.timidity were among the ruling principles of our.forefathers in their most decided conduct. Not being.illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of.France tell us they have got so abundant a share, they.acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and.fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus.fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct.attended to their nature. Let us imitate their caution.if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their.bequests. Let us add, if we please, but let us preserve.what they have left; and, standing on the firm ground.of the British constitution, let us be satisfied to.admire rather than attempt to follow in their.desperate flights the aeronauts of France.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: “I’ve come to inquire if you have work for me. That is, if.my performance pleased you before.” A deliberate prompt. I.didn’t want to be hired because of my need or his kindness. I.wanted my talent to be the reason he wanted me back..“Indeed” was all he offered..What now to fill the suspended moment? His new.projects. I asked. His eyebrows leapt up in symmetrical.curves..“A Byzantine chapel for the World’s Columbian.Exposition in Chicago next year. Four times bigger than the.Paris Exposition Universelle. It will be the greatest assembly.of artists since the fifteenth century.” He counted on his.fingers and then drummed them on the desk. “Only fifteen.months away. In 1893 the name of Louis Comfort Tiffany.will be on the lips of millions!” He stood up and swung open.his arms wide enough to embrace the whole world..I sensed his open palm somewhere in the air behind the.small of my back, ushering me to his massive, carved.mahogany exhibit table to see his sketches and watercolors..“Two round windows, The Infancy of Christ and Botticelli’s.Madonna and Child, will be set off by a dozen scenic side.windows.”.A huge undertaking. How richly fortunate. Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, a significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it
Choices:
  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.

  The answer is D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The Venus flytrap needs to conserve energy and only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the visiting insect is large enough to be worth its time.

  The answer is D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The Venus flytrap requires two triggers to close its trap.
  The first trigger does not cause the trap to close, but it encodes the information that something has touched one of its hairs.
  The second trigger causes the trap to close, but only if it occurs within a certain time frame.
  Therefore, the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers prevents it from closing before capturing its prey.
  The answer is D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The Venus flytrap requires two triggers to close.
  The closure of the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium.
  A single trigger does not reach the required calcium concentration.
  The second trigger pushes the calcium concentration over the threshold and springs the trap.
  Therefore, the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
  The answer is D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The Venus flytrap requires two triggers to close its trap and capture its prey.
  The first trigger alone is not enough to push the calcium concentration over the threshold required to close the trap.
  Thus, the second trigger ensures that the calcium concentration is high enough to close the trap.
  This system prevents the plant from closing its trap and expending energy on prey that are too small.
  Therefore, the answer is D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Action: Answer("D")

  The answer is C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The Venus flytrap requires two triggers to close its trap and capture its prey.
  The reason for this is that a single trigger does not provide enough calcium to close the trap.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close.
  If the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the memory of the first touch is lost.
  Therefore, the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers prevents it from wasting energy by closing before capturing its prey.
  The answer is C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage explains that the Venus flytrap needs two triggers to close its trap and capture its prey.
  The reason for this is that a single trigger does not create a high enough concentration of calcium ions to close the trap.
  Therefore, having multiple triggers conserves the plant's energy supply by preventing it from expending energy on closing its trap for small prey.
  The passage does not mention that this requirement helps the plant identify the species of its prey.
  Therefore, the answer is not A.
  The passage does mention that the Venus flytrap requires a high concentration of calcium ions to close its trap and that a single trigger does not create a high enough concentration.
  Therefore, having multiple triggers is advantageous because it ensures that the trap only closes when the calcium concentration is high enough.
  This conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  Therefore, the answer is B.
  The passage does not mention that the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  Therefore, the answer is not C.
  The passage explains that the Venus flytrap requires two triggers to close its trap and capture its prey.
  Therefore, the requirement for multiple triggers prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
  Therefore, the answer is D.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The Venus flytrap requires two triggers to close its trap.
  The first trigger causes an electric action potential which induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close.
  A single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach the level required to close the trap.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  The concentration of calcium ions dissipates over time.
  Therefore, if the second trigger does not happen quickly enough, the final concentration of calcium ions after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
  Based on these points, it seems that a significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
  Therefore, the answer is D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.

  The Venus flytrap requires multiple triggers to close its trap.
  The first trigger does not cause the trap to close.
  The second trigger causes the trap to close.
  The concentration of calcium ions must be high enough for the trap to close.
  If the second trigger does not happen quickly, the memory is lost and the trap remains open.
  Therefore, the requirement for multiple triggers prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
  The answer is D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their  parents. "They jumped up like popcorn," he said, 5 describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. "He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. "I asked 35 him how it went," Ken recalled, "and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' " Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the "aha" moment. "The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively," he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. "It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car," he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis," says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. "Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth," Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. "We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment," Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 "standard of care treatment." That's going to take five years and $\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: “I’ve come to inquire if you have work for me. That is, if.my performance pleased you before.” A deliberate prompt. I.didn’t want to be hired because of my need or his kindness. I.wanted my talent to be the reason he wanted me back..“Indeed” was all he offered..What now to fill the suspended moment? His new.projects. I asked. His eyebrows leapt up in symmetrical.curves..“A Byzantine chapel for the World’s Columbian.Exposition in Chicago next year. Four times bigger than the.Paris Exposition Universelle. It will be the greatest assembly.of artists since the fifteenth century.” He counted on his.fingers and then drummed them on the desk. “Only fifteen.months away. In 1893 the name of Louis Comfort Tiffany.will be on the lips of millions!” He stood up and swung open.his arms wide enough to embrace the whole world..I sensed his open palm somewhere in the air behind the.small of my back, ushering me to his massive, carved.mahogany exhibit table to see his sketches and watercolors..“Two round windows, The Infancy of Christ and Botticelli’s.Madonna and Child, will be set off by a dozen scenic side.windows.”.A huge undertaking. How richly fortunate. Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

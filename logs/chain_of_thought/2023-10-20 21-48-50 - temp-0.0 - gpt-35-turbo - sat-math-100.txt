Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$
  D: $\$ 29,700$
Response 0:
Thought:
  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  Let's use the formula for the equation of a line to find the value of the equipment after 4 years.
  We know that the initial value of the equipment is $\$ 32,400$.
  We also know that the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years, so the rate of depreciation is $\frac{\$ 32,400 - \$ 0}{12 \text{ years}} = \$ 2,700$ per year.
  Therefore, the equation of the line that represents the value of the equipment over time is:
  $$
  V(t) = -2700t + 32400
  $$
  where $t$ is the time in years and $V(t)$ is the value of the equipment in dollars.
  To find the value of the equipment after 4 years, we can substitute $t = 4$ into the equation:
  $$
  V(4) = -2700(4) + 32400 = \$ 21,600
  $$
  Therefore, the value of the camera equipment 4 years after it is purchased is $\$ 21,600$.

Question: $$\frac{a-b}{a}=c$$In the equation above, if $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: $c>1$
  B: $c=1$
  C: $c=-1$
  D: $c<-1$
Response 0:
Thought:
  If $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, then $a-b$ is negative.
  Since $a$ is negative, $-a$ is positive.
  Therefore, $\frac{a-b}{a}=\frac{-1(a-b)}{-1a}=\frac{b-a}{-a}=\frac{a-b}{a}=c$.
  Since $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, $a-b$ is negative and $|a-b|=b-a$.
  Therefore, $c=\frac{a-b}{a}=\frac{b-a}{-a}=\frac{|a-b|}{a}$.
  Since $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, $|a-b|=b-a$ is positive.
  Therefore, $c=\frac{|a-b|}{a}>0$.
  If $c>1$, then $|a-b|>a$, which is not possible since $|a-b|$ is positive and $a$ is negative.
  If $c=1$, then $|a-b|=a$, which is not possible since $|a-b|$ is positive and $a$ is negative.
  If $c=-1$, then $|a-b|=-a$, which is not possible since $|a-b|$ is positive and $a$ is negative.

  We can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination method.
  Let's use the elimination method to solve the system of equations.
  Multiply the second equation by 3 and add it to the first equation to eliminate x.
  We get $10y=-68$, which implies $y=-\frac{34}{5}$.
  Substitute $y=-\frac{34}{5}$ into the second equation to solve for x.
  We get $x=3y+19=\frac{3}{5}$.
  Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(x,y)=\left(\frac{3}{5},-\frac{34}{5}\right)$.

  We can start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses.
  $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{x+2+x+3}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$
  $= \frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{x^2+5x+6}}$
  We can then simplify further by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the reciprocal of the fraction in the denominator.

Topic: Math
Question: $$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$The equation above is true for all $x$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. What is the value of $a b$ ?
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 24
  D: 40

Thought:
  We can start by multiplying the left side of the equation and simplifying it.
  $$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
  $$5ax^3 - abx^2 + 20ax^2 - 3bx^2 + 15x - 4abx + 12a = 20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
  $$5ax^3 + (20a - ab)x^2 + (-4ab - 9)x + (12a + 15) = 20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
  We can equate the coefficients of the same degree terms on both sides of the equation.
  For the coefficient of $x^3$, we have $5a = 20$, which gives us $a = 4$.
  For the coefficient of $x^2$, we have $20a - ab = -9$, which gives us $b = -\frac{71}{16}$.
  Therefore, $ab = 4 \times -\frac{71}{16} = -\frac{71}{4}$.

Question: Shipping Charges\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$\begin{array}{c}\text { Merchandise weight } \\ \text { (pounds) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Shipping } \\ \text { charge }\end{array}$ \\\hline5 & $\$ 16.94$ \\\hline10 & $\$ 21.89$ \\\hline20 & $\$ 31.79$ \\\hline40 & $\$ 51.59$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows shipping charges for an online retailer that sells sporting goods. There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$
  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$
  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$
  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$
Response 0:
Thought:
  The function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge should be a linear function.
  The function should have a slope that represents the rate of change of the shipping charge per pound of merchandise weight.
  The slope can be calculated by finding the difference in shipping charges for any two weights and dividing by the difference in weights.
  For example, the slope can be calculated as follows: $\frac{\$21.89-\$16.94}{10-5}=\$0.99$ per pound.

If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can use the given table to find the slope of the line that relates $x$ and $y$.
  The slope of a line is given by the formula $m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$.
  The rise is the change in $y$ and the run is the change in $x$.
  We can use the first and second rows of the table to find the rise and run.
  The change in $y$ is $-a-0=-a$ and the change in $x$ is $3a-a=2a$.
  Therefore, the slope of the line is $m=\frac{-a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}$.
  We can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the equation of the line.
  The point-slope form of the equation of a line is $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope of the line.
  We can use the point $(a,0)$, which is on the line, to find the equation of the line.
  Substituting $m=-\frac{1}{2}$, $x_1=a$, and $y_1=0$ into the point-slope form of the equation of a line gives $y-0=-\frac{1}{2}(x-a)$.
  Simplifying this equation gives $2y=-x+2a$, which is equivalent to $x+2y=2a$.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A psychologist set up an experiment to study the tendency of a person to select the first item when presented with a series of items. In the experiment, 300 people were presented with a set of five pictures arranged in random order. Each person was asked to choose the most appealing picture. Of the first 150 participants, 36 chose the first picture in the set. Among the remaining 150 participants, $p$ people chose the first picture in the set. If more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set, which of the following inequalities best describes the possible values of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $p>0.20(300-36)$, where $p \leq 150$
  B: $p>0.20(300+36)$, where $p \leq 150$
  C: $p-36>0.20(300)$, where $p \leq 150$
  D: $p+36>0.20(300)$, where $p \leq 150$
Response 0:
Thought:
  The total number of participants is 300.
  The number of participants who chose the first picture among the first 150 participants is 36.
  The number of participants who chose the first picture among the remaining 150 participants is $p$.
  We want to find the possible values of $p$ if more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture.
  We can start by finding the minimum number of participants who chose the first picture.
  If $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture, then the minimum number of participants who chose the first picture is $0.20(300)=60$.
  Since more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture, the actual number of participants who chose the first picture is greater than 60.
  We know that 36 participants chose the first picture among the first 150 participants.
  Therefore, the actual number of participants who chose the first picture among the remaining 150 participants must be greater than $60-36=24$.
  This means $p>24$.
  Also, $p$ cannot be greater than 150, since there are only 150 participants left to choose from.
  Therefore, the best inequality that describes the possible values of $p$ is $24<p\leq150$.
  We can simplify this inequality to $p>24$ and $p\leq150$.
  The answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

  We want to find the possible values of $p$ if more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture.
  We can start by finding the minimum number of participants who chose the first picture.
  If $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture, then the minimum number of participants who chose the first picture is $0.20(300)=60$.
  Since more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture, the actual number of participants who chose the first picture is greater than 60.
  We know that 36 participants chose the first picture among the first 150 participants.
  Therefore, the actual number of participants who chose the first picture among the remaining 150 participants must be greater than $60-36=24$.
  This means $p>24$.
  Also, $p$ cannot be greater than 150, since there are only 150 participants left to choose from.
  Therefore, the best inequality that describes the possible values of $p$ is $24<p\leq150$.
  We can simplify this inequality to $p>24$ and $p\leq150$.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ passes through the origin. Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 4
  C: 8
  D: 16
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the line passes through the origin, then the coordinates of both points must satisfy the equation of the line.
  The equation of the line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:
  $y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)$
  If the line passes through $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$, then the equation of the line is:
  $y - k = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}(x - 2)$
  If the line passes through the origin, then $(0, 0)$ must satisfy the equation of the line.
  Substituting $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ in the equation of the line, we get:
  $-k = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}(-2)$
  $k = \frac{64}{k - 2}$
  $k^2 - 2k - 64 = 0$
  Solving the quadratic equation, we get:
  $k = -8$ or $k = 10$
  Since $k$ must be positive, the only possible value of $k$ is 10.

  $y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)$
  If the line passes through $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$, then the equation of the line is:
  $y - k = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}(x - 2)$
  If the line passes through the origin, then $(0, 0)$ must satisfy the equation of the line.
  Substituting $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ in the equation of the line, we get:
  $-k = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}(-2)$
  $k = \frac{64}{k - 2}$
  $k^2 - 2k - 64 = 0$
  Solving the quadratic equation, we get:
  $k = -8$ or $k = 10$
  Since $k$ must be positive, the only possible value of $k$ is 10.
  Therefore, the answer is D: 16.

Question: If 50 one-cent coins were stacked on top of each other in a column, the column would be approximately $3 \frac{7}{8}$ inches tall. At this rate, which of the following is closest to the number of one-cent coins it would take to make an 8-inch-tall column?
Choices:
  A: 75
  B: 100
  C: 200
  D: 390
Response 0:
Thought:
  50 one-cent coins make a column of $3 \frac{7}{8}$ inches.
  To find how many coins are needed to make an 8-inch-tall column, we can set up a proportion.
  Let x be the number of coins needed to make an 8-inch-tall column.
  $\frac{50}{3 \frac{7}{8}} = \frac{x}{8}$
  We can convert $3 \frac{7}{8}$ to an improper fraction: $\frac{31}{8}$.
  $\frac{50}{\frac{31}{8}} = \frac{x}{8}$
  Simplifying the left side of the equation: $\frac{50 \cdot 8}{31} = \frac{x}{8}$
  Solving for x: $x = \frac{50 \cdot 8 \cdot 8}{31} \approx 103$
  The closest answer choice is B: 100.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}Year & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Subscriptions } \\ \text { sold }\end{array}$ \\\hline2012 & 5,600 \\2013 & 5,880 \\\end{tabular}\end{center}The manager of an online news service received the report above on the number of subscriptions sold by the service. The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let x be the percent increase from 2012 to 2013.
  Let y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.
  We know that y = 2x.
  We need to find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  To do that, we need to find the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 and add the expected increase in subscriptions in 2014.
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2013 is 5,880.
  The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is (5,880 - 5,600)/5,600 = 0.05.
  The percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is y.
  We can find y by using the formula (5,880 + x*5,880) * (1 + y/100) = S, where S is the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.

Question: A customer paid $\$ 53.00$ for a jacket after a 6 percent sales tax was added. What was the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 47.60$
  B: $\$ 50.00$
  C: $\$ 52.60$
  D: $\$ 52.84$
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume the price of the jacket before the sales tax was added is $x$.
  The sales tax is 6% of the price of the jacket, which is $0.06x$.
  The total amount paid by the customer is the sum of the price of the jacket and the sales tax, which is $x + 0.06x = 1.06x$.
  We know that the customer paid $\$ 53.00$, so we can set up the equation $1.06x = 53$ and solve for $x$.
  $1.06x = 53$
  $x = \frac{53}{1.06}$

Question: If a white birch tree and a pin oak tree each now have a diameter of 1 foot, which of the following will be closest to the difference, in inches, of their diameters 10 years from now? $(1$ foot $=12$ inches $)$
Choices:
  A: 1.0
  B: 1.2
  C: 1.3
  D: 1.4
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the diameter of the white birch tree and the pin oak tree will increase by the same percentage each year.
  We can use the formula $d=rt$ where $d$ is the diameter, $r$ is the rate of increase, and $t$ is the time in years.
  We can solve for $r$ by using the formula $r=\frac{d}{t}$.
  The difference in their diameters 10 years from now will be $d_{\text{pin oak}}-d_{\text{white birch}}$.
  We can use the formula $d=rt$ to find the diameter of each tree 10 years from now.
  Then, we can subtract the diameter of the white birch tree from the diameter of the pin oak tree to find the difference.
  The answer will be the closest choice to the difference in inches.

Choices:
  A: $(-3,0)$
  B: $(0,3)$
  C: $(6,-3)$
  D: $(36,-6)$
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can solve the system of equations by substituting the first equation into the second equation.
  Substituting $x=y-3$ into $\frac{x}{2}+2y=6$ gives $\frac{y-3}{2}+2y=6$.
  Simplifying the equation gives $5y=15$, so $y=3$.
  Substituting $y=3$ into $x=y-3$ gives $x=0$.
  Therefore, the ordered pair $(x,y)=(0,3)$ satisfies the system of equations.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
Thought:
  Ken earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked, so he earned $\$ 8 \cdot 10 = \$ 80$.
  Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week.
  He earned $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week, so he earned $\$ 10x$.
  Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week, so he saves $0.9(\$ 80 + \$ 10x) = \$ 72 + \$ 9x$.
  We need to find the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week, so we need to solve the inequality $\$ 72 + \$ 9x \geq \$ 270$.
  Solving for $x$, we get $x \geq \frac{198}{9} \approx 22$.
  The least integer greater than or equal to $\frac{198}{9}$ is $22$.
  Therefore, Ken must work at least $22$ hours the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 6
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the helicopter carries x 100-pound packages and y 120-pound packages.
  We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y >= 10.
  We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y <= 1,100.
  We want to find the maximum value of y.
  We can use trial and error to find the maximum value of y that satisfies both inequalities.
  If we start with y = 6, then 100x + 120y = 100x + 720, which means that 100x <= 380.
  The largest multiple of 100 that is less than or equal to 380 is 300, which means that x <= 3.
  If x = 3 and y = 6, then the total weight is 100(3) + 120(6) = 780, which is less than or equal to 1,100.
  Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 6.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. What is the length of $\overline{A B}$ ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 12
  C: 14
  D: 16
Response 0:
Thought:
  The equation of the parabola is $y=(x-11)^2$.
  The equation of the line is $y=25$.
  To find the intersection points, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$.
  $(x-11)^2=25$
  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x-11=\pm5$.
  Solving for $x$, we get $x=6$ or $x=16$.
  Therefore, the points of intersection are $(6,25)$ and $(16,25)$.
  The distance between these two points is $\sqrt{(16-6)^2+(25-25)^2}=\sqrt{100}=10$.
  Therefore, the length of $\overline{AB}$ is 10.

Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
Thought:
  The oil and gas production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013.
  The difference in production is 4 - 1.9 = 2.1 million barrels.
  The production decreased over 13 years (2013 - 2000 = 13).
  Therefore, the production decreased at a constant rate of 2.1/13 million barrels per year.
  The function that models the production is of the form $f(t) = mt + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  The slope of the function is the rate of decrease, which is -2.1/13.
  The y-intercept is the initial production, which is 4.
  Therefore, the function that models the production is $f(t) = -\frac{2.1}{13}t + 4$.
  The answer is C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.

Topic: Math
Question: Townsend Realty purchased the Glenview Street property and received a $40 \%$ discount off the original price along with an additional $20 \%$ off the discounted price for purchasing the property in cash. Which of the following best approximates the original price, in dollars, of the Glenview Street property?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 350,000$
  B: $\$ 291,700$
  C: $\$ 233,300$
  D: $\$ 175,000$
Response 0:
Thought:
Let's assume the original price of the property is $x$ dollars.
Townsend Realty received a $40 \%$ discount off the original price, which means they paid $60 \%$ of the original price.
Then, they received an additional $20 \%$ off the discounted price for purchasing the property in cash.
So, the final price they paid is $80 \%$ of $60 \%$ of the original price.
Therefore, the final price they paid is $0.8 \times 0.6 \times x = 0.48x$ dollars.
We need to find the original price, which is $x$ dollars.
We can set up an equation: $0.48x = \text{final price}$.
We know that the final price is the price they paid after the discounts, but we don't know the exact amount.
However, we can use the answer choices to estimate the final price and solve for $x$.
Let's try answer choice A: $\$ 350,000$.
$0.48 \times \$ 350,000 = \$ 168,000$.
This is less than the final price they paid, so we can eliminate choice A.
Let's try answer choice B: $\$ 291,700$.
$0.48 \times \$ 291,700 \approx \$ 140,016$.
This is close to the final price they paid, so we'll keep choice B as a possibility.
Let's try answer choice C: $\$ 233,300$.
$0.48 \times \$ 233,300 \approx \$ 111,984$.
This is less than the final price they paid, so we can eliminate choice C.
Let's try answer choice D: $\$ 175,000$.
$0.48 \times \$ 175,000 \approx \$ 84,000$.
This is much less than the final price they paid, so we can eliminate choice D.
Therefore, the best approximation for the original price, in dollars, of the Glenview Street property is $\$ 291,700$.

This is much less than the final price they paid, so we can eliminate choice D.
Therefore, the best approximation for the original price, in dollars, of the Glenview Street property is $\$ 291,700$.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
Let's assume the original price of the property is $x$ dollars.
Townsend Realty received a $40 \%$ discount off the original price, which means they paid $60 \%$ of the original price.
Then, they received an additional $20 \%$ off the discounted price for purchasing the property in cash.
So, the final price they paid is $80 \%$ of $60 \%$ of the original price.
Therefore, the final price they paid is $0.8 \times 0.6 \times x = 0.48x$ dollars.
We need to find the original price, which is $x$ dollars.
We can set up an equation: $0.48x = \text{final price}$.
We know that the final price is the price they paid after the discounts, but we don't know the exact amount.
However, we can use the answer choices to estimate the final price and solve for $x$.
Let's try answer choice A: $\$ 350,000$.
$0.48 \times \$ 350,000 = \$ 168,000$.
This is less than the final price they paid, so we can eliminate choice A.
Let's try answer choice B: $\$ 291,700$.
$0.48 \times \$ 291,700 \approx \$ 140,016$.
This is close to the final price they paid, so we'll keep choice B as a possibility.
Let's try answer choice C: $\$ 233,300$.
$0.48 \times \$ 233,300 \approx \$ 111,984$.
This is less than the final price they paid, so we can eliminate choice C.
Let's try answer choice D: $\$ 175,000$.
$0.48 \times \$ 175,000 \approx \$ 84,000$.

Question: Keith modeled the growth over several hundred years of a tree population by estimating the number of the trees' pollen grains per square centimeter that were deposited each year within layers of a lake's sediment. He estimated there were 310 pollen grains per square centimeter the first year the grains were deposited, with a $1 \%$ annual increase in the number of grains per square centimeter thereafter. Which of the following functions models $P(t)$, the number of pollen grains per square centimeter $t$ years after the first year the grains were deposited?
Choices:
  A: $P(t)=310^{t}$
  B: $P(t)=310^{1.01 t}$
  C: $P(t)=310(0.99)^{t}$
  D: $P(t)=310(1.01)^{t}$
Response 0:

Topic: Math
Question: $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's first find out how many hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland's job.
  Let $h_R$ be the number of hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland's job.
  Then, $h_R+2$ is the number of hours the electrician worked for Ms. Sanchez's job.
  We can set up two equations using the given information:
  $C_R=75h_R+125$ is the amount Mr. Roland was charged.
  $C_S=75(h_R+2)+125=75h_R+175$ is the amount Ms. Sanchez was charged.
  The difference between the two amounts is $C_S-C_R=75h_R+175-(75h_R+125)=50$.
  Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$50$ more than Mr. Roland.

Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
Thought:
  The energy in a granola bar comes entirely from protein, fat, and carbohydrate.
  The energy per gram of protein is 4.0 food calories.
  The energy per gram of fat is 9.0 food calories.
  The energy per gram of carbohydrate is 4.0 food calories.
  Let $p$, $f$, and $c$ be the number of grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in the granola bar, respectively.
  The total energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories.
  Therefore, $4p+9f+4c=180$.
  We need to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$.
  Rearranging the equation, we get $9f=180-4p-4c$.
  Dividing both sides by 9, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
  Therefore, the answer is B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.

  The interval that contains $-2$ is $-3<x<1$.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The vertex of a parabola is located at the point where the slope changes from increasing to decreasing.
  The slope of a parabola changes at the vertex because the derivative of the function is zero at that point.
  The function $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ can be expanded to $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$.
  The vertex of the parabola is located at $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2}= -2$.
  Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is $-2$.
  The interval that contains $-2$ is $-3<x<1$.

  B: $x=-2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{30}}{3}$
  C: $x=-6 \pm \sqrt{2}$
  D: $x=-6 \pm 6 \sqrt{2}$
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can solve the quadratic equation $3 x^{2}+12 x+6=0$ by using the quadratic formula.
  The quadratic formula is $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$.
  In this case, $a=3$, $b=12$, and $c=6$.
  Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{12^{2}-4 \cdot 3 \cdot 6}}{2 \cdot 3}$.
  Simplifying this expression, we get $x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{96}}{6}$.
  Factoring out $\sqrt{96}$, we get $x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{16 \cdot 6}}{6}$.
  Simplifying further, we get $x=\frac{-12 \pm 4 \sqrt{6}}{6}$.
  Factoring out $4$, we get $x=\frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{6}}{3}$.
  Therefore, the solutions to $3 x^{2}+12 x+6=0$ are $x=\frac{-3 + \sqrt{6}}{3}$ and $x=\frac{-3 - \sqrt{6}}{3}$.

  The present population of the city is 50,000.
  We need to find the expression that represents the population of the city t years from now.
  If t is a multiple of 20, then the population will be multiplied by (0.9)^(t/20).
  If t is not a multiple of 20, then we need to use the formula for compound interest with a negative growth rate.
  The formula is P = A(1 - r/n)^(nt), where P is the population after t years, A is the initial population, r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), and n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.
  In this case, r = 0.1, n = 1, and t is the number of years since the present.
  Therefore, the expression that represents the population of the city t years from now is:
  D: $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 22
Response 0:
Thought:
Let's assume that the original length and width of the rectangle are $l$ and $w$, respectively. 
The original area of the rectangle is $lw$. 
After the alterations, the new length of the rectangle is $1.1l$ and the new width is $(1-p/100)w$. 
The new area of the rectangle is $(1-0.12)lw = 0.88lw$. 
We can set up an equation using the information above and solve for $p$.

$(1.1l)(1-\frac{p}{100})w = 0.88lw$

$1.1(1-\frac{p}{100}) = 0.88$

$1-\frac{p}{100} = \frac{0.88}{1.1}$

$1-\frac{p}{100} = 0.8$

$\frac{p}{100} = 0.2$

$p = 20$

  We can expand the left side of the equation to get a quadratic equation in the form of $ax^2+bx+c$.
  Then we can compare the coefficients of the quadratic equation with the given quadratic equation to find the value of $c$.
  We can use the fact that $a+b=8$ to find the value of $a$ and $b$.
  Let's expand the left side of the equation:
  $(a x+2)(b x+7)=a b x^{2}+(7 a+2 b) x+14$
  We can compare the coefficients of the quadratic equation with the given quadratic equation to find the value of $c$:
  $ab=15$, $7a+2b=c$
  We can use the fact that $a+b=8$ to find the value of $a$ and $b$:
  $a=8-b$
  Substituting this into the equation $ab=15$, we get:
  $(8-b)b=15$
  $b^2-8b+15=0$
  $(b-3)(b-5)=0$
  $b=3$ or $b=5$
  If $b=3$, then $a=5$ and $c=7a+2b=35$
  If $b=5$, then $a=3$ and $c=7a+2b=21$

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\hline\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Townsend Realty Group Investments} \\\hlineProperty address & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Purchase price } \\ \text { (dollars) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Monthly rental } \\ \text { price } \\ \text { (dollars) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineClearwater Lane & 128,000 & 950 \\\hlineDriftwood Drive & 176,000 & 1,310 \\\hlineEdgemont Street & 70,000 & 515 \\\hlineGlenview Street & 140,000 & 1,040 \\\hlineHamilton Circle & 450,000 & 3,365 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The Townsend Realty Group invested in the five different properties listed in the table above. The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to find a linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price.
  We can use the formula for a linear function, y = mx + b, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.
  We can use two points from the table to find the slope of the function.
  We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line.
  We need to convert the purchase price from thousands of dollars to dollars.
  
Action: 
  We can use the points (128, 950) and (450, 3365) to find the slope of the function.
  The slope is (3365 - 950) / (450 - 128) = 2415 / 322 = 7.5
  The y-intercept is the monthly rental price when the purchase price is 0, which is not possible in this context.
  We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is a point on the line.
  We can use the point (128, 950) to find the equation of the line: y - 950 = 7.5(x - 128)
  Simplifying the equation, we get y = 7.5x - 10
  Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price is r(p) = 7.5p - 10.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Roberto is an insurance agent who sells two types of policies: a $\$ 50,000$ policy and a $\$ 100,000$ policy. Last month, his goal was to sell at least 57 insurance policies. While he did not meet his goal, the total value of the policies he sold was over $\$ 3,000,000$. Which of the following systems of inequalities describes $x$, the possible number of $\$ 50,000$ policies, and $y$, the possible number of $\$ 100,000$ policies, that Roberto sold last month?
Choices:
  A: $x+y<57$ $50,000 x+100,000 y<3,000,000$
  B: $x+y>57$ $50,000 x+100,000 y>3,000,000$
  C: $x+y<57$ $50,000 x+100,000 y>3,000,000$
  D: $x+y>57$ $50,000 x+100,000 y<3,000,000$

  Let's start by setting up the equations.
  Let $x$ be the number of $\$ 50,000$ policies sold.
  Let $y$ be the number of $\$ 100,000$ policies sold.
  We know that $x+y<57$ because Roberto did not meet his goal of selling at least 57 policies.
  We also know that $50,000 x+100,000 y>3,000,000$ because the total value of the policies sold was over $\$ 3,000,000$.

Question: The first year Eleanor organized a fund-raising event, she invited 30 people. For each of the next 5 years, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year. If $f(n)$ is the number of people invited to the fund-raiser $n$ years after Eleanor began organizing the event, which of the following statements best describes the function $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: The function $f$ is a decreasing linear function.
  B: The function $f$ is an increasing linear function.
  C: The function $f$ is a decreasing exponential function.
  D: The function $f$ is an increasing exponential function.
Response 0:
Thought:
  In the first year, Eleanor invited 30 people.
  For the second year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is $2 \times 30 = 60$ people.
  For the third year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is $2 \times 60 = 120$ people.
  For the fourth year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is $2 \times 120 = 240$ people.
  For the fifth year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is $2 \times 240 = 480$ people.
  Therefore, the number of people invited to the fund-raiser $n$ years after Eleanor began organizing the event is $f(n) = 30 \times 2^{n-1}$.
  This is an increasing exponential function because the base of the exponent is greater than 1, and the function increases as $n$ increases.

  This is an increasing exponential function because the base of the exponent is greater than 1, and the function increases as $n$ increases.

Thought: 
  We want to find the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never."
  We can use the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
  Let A be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and B be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never."
  We can find P(B) by adding the percentages of tablet users who answered "Rarely," "Often," and "Always."
  P(B) = 24.3% + 13.5% + 30.9% = 68.7%
  We can find P(A and B) by looking at the percentage of tablet users who answered "Always" and did not answer "Never."
  P(A and B) = 30.9%
  Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 30.9% / 68.7% = 0.45 (rounded to two decimal places).
  The closest choice to 0.45 is C: 0.45.

  Therefore, $x=2$.
  Substituting $x=2$ into the second equation, we get:
  $$3(2)-2y=-6$$
  Solving for $y$, we get:
  $$y=6$$
  Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
  The answer is C: -4.

Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
Response 0:
Thought:
  The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  Since the line passes through the origin, the y-intercept is 0.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the x and y coordinates of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation is true.
  Substituting $(0,7)$, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(0)$, which is not true.
  Substituting $(1,7)$, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(1)$, which is not true.
  Substituting $(7,7)$, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(7)$, which is true.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$

  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal.
  The total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270.
  Therefore, the total number of calories from Super Grain cereal and Crunchy Grain cereal is 270.
  The number of calories from Super Grain cereal is $240x$.
  The number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)-50$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: We are told that it is not within the "province of woman," to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a "political question," and we are "stepping out of our  sphere," when we take part in its discussion. It is nottrue that it is merely a political question, it is likewise a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of religion; a question which, while it involves considerations of immense importance to the welfare and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into thehome-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to unrequited toil-whether he shall walk erect in the dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckonedamong the beasts which perish - whether his bones and sinews shall be his own, or another's-whether his child shall receive the protection of its natural guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest ofthe master may dictate $\_\ldots$ these considerations are all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.And is a subject comprehending interests of such magnitude, merely a "political question," and one in which woman "can take no part without losingsomething of the modesty and gentleness which are her most appropriate ornaments"? May not the "ornament of a meek and quiet spirit" exist with an upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart isopen to the claims of humanity, or less modest because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their rescue?By the Constitution of the United States, the  whole physical power of the North is pledged for the suppression of domestic insurrections, and should the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the North are bound to make common cause with the 40 tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet, every effort on the part of the slave, for the attainment of his freedom. And when the father, husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes to mingle in the unholy warfare, "to become the 45 executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands,"1 will the mother, wife, daughter, and sister feel that they have no interest in this subject? Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and50 their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she55 will not be deterred from the performance of her duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the cry of political question.But admitting it to be a political question, have we no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not60 permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of our own family circle, and of the present hour? May we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the 65 earth? Must we witness "the headlong rage or heedless folly," with which our nation is rushing onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its downward course? Shall we silently behold the land which we love with all the heart-warm affection of70 children, rendered a hissing and a reproach throughout the world, by this system which is already tolling the death-bell of her decease among the nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright75 prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely our hearts cling to "our altars and our homes," the80 more fervent are our aspirations that every inhabitant of our land may be protected in his fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom85 God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our course, then, still be onward!
Question: Which choice best summarizes the first paragraph?
Choices:
  A: Smith explains a conventional viewpoint and presents evidence supporting it.
  B: Smith rejects a claim and elaborates on her reasons for doing so.
  C: Smith introduces her subject and provides historical background for understanding it.
  D: Smith identifies a problem and proposes steps to remedy it.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The first paragraph discusses the topic of slavery and the conventional idea that it is not appropriate for women to discuss it because it is a "political question."
  A: This choice is incorrect because Smith presents evidence against the conventional viewpoint, rather than supporting it.
  B: This choice is closer to the correct answer, but it misses the fact that Smith is not rejecting a specific claim, but rather a general idea that women should not discuss political questions. 
  C: This choice may be a potential answer, but it is too broad and does not fully capture the essence of the paragraph. 
  D: This choice is incorrect because Smith does not propose any steps to remedy the problem; she is rather discussing why it is important for women to participate in the discussion of slavery. 
Thought:
  Smith is rejecting the idea that women should not discuss political questions, particularly the issue of slavery. While some view slavery as just a political question, Smith argues that it encompasses critical matters of justice, morality, humanity, and religion. 
  Even though the Constitution of the United States requires people in the North to suppress domestic insurrections, Smith argues that women should still take part in the issue because it affects homes and millions of fellow beings.
  Therefore, choice B is the best summary of the first paragraph because Smith is rejecting the idea that it is not within the "province of woman" to discuss the subject of slavery and elaborating on her reasons for doing so. 
Criticism: 
  The thought process is accurate, and the selected choice (B) is the most suitable option; therefore, no criticism is necessary.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage concerns the subject of slavery and the role women should play in discussions surrounding it.

She then questions why women should not be involved in the discussion regarding the well-being of their fellow human beings. 
The best answer that summarizes the first paragraph is B: Smith rejects a claim and elaborates on her reasons for doing so.

  This answer is not entirely comprehensive, as it does not mention the specific claim that Smith rejects. It could also be argued that Smith is more focused on presenting her argument than on rejecting a claim.
Action: Answer("B")

  The answer is B: Smith rejects a claim and elaborates on her reasons for doing so.
Criticism: 
  The first paragraph of the passage does not introduce historical background, identify a problem, or propose steps to remedy anything.
  Instead, it counters the claim that women should not discuss slavery and offers reasons for why they should participate in the discussion.
  Therefore, option C is not the best summary of the paragraph.
  The paragraph does not fully support any conventional viewpoint, so option A is incorrect.
  The paragraph does not propose any solution or steps to remedy anything, so option D is also incorrect.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: In the passage, Smith argues that it is possible for women to engage in which activity?
Choices:
  A: Acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity
  B: Adhering to personal morality while being politically neutral
  C: Contributing to their family's financial security while meeting social expectations
  D: Resisting calls for war while still opposing slavery
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about the topic of slavery and its impact on women's lives.
  A: Smith argues that women can feel compassion for people suffering from slavery while still being meek and kind-hearted.
  B: Smith argues that issues around slavery impact everyone in the country, so women should care.
  C: The passage does not mention women's financial security or social expectations.
  D: Smith argues that women have a stake in the issue of slavery and should not shy away from helping to solve the problem. The passage does not provide information on resistance to calls for war.
Thought: 
  The passage argues that women should be able to engage in the discussion of slavery, despite the fact that some argue that it's outside a woman's purview.
  The text contends that women can be kind and gentle while intellectually advocating for freedom.
  The passage also notes that women should care about the issue because they are affected by the consequences of slavery as fellow humans.
  Women can take part in political discussions that concern questions of justice and morality, as slavery does.
  The correct answer is A because Smith argues that women can participate in politics and care about these causes while still being true to their feminine ideals.
Criticism: 
  There is no information in the passage about women's financial security or whether they meet social expectations.
  Furthermore, the passage discusses women engaging with the topic of slavery on an intellectual level, not necessarily financially.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that women are told not to discuss issues of slavery because it is a political issue and outside the scope of women.
  The author refutes this claim by stating that slavery is not just a political issue but a matter of justice, humanity, morality, and religion.
  The author argues that the Constitution of the United States pledges the physical power of the North for the suppression of domestic insurrection and that women should not stay ignorant of this issue and its impact on their lives.
Thought:
  The author stresses that women can have an "upright and enlightened" intellect while also possessing "meek and quiet spirit."
  Women should become politically involved and active in opposing unjust laws when it affects their family's domestic happiness and financial security.
  The author highlights that women can contribute to a humanitarian cause, such as the abolition of slavery, while also demonstrating their modesty and gentleness.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the passage that the author suggests women can contribute to their family's financial security, or remaining politically neutral.
  The passage is primarily focused on slavery, and not on war, and there is no indication the author is against war.
  Overall, the evidence in the passage supports A as the most likely answer. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the possibility of women being politically involved in the issue of slavery without losing their "modesty and gentleness,"and shows that women can adhere to their humane principles without being negatively impacted by societal expectations and gender roles. 
A: This option fits the text. The author argues that women can have an "upright mind, and enlightened intellect, and must not necessarily be less gentle because of their empathy toward those enslaved."
B: This option does not fit the text. The author argues that women should be involved in political issues related to the question of slavery, and that it is not a political question alone. 
C: This option is not discussed in the text and is irrelevant to the passage's main point.
D: This option contradicts the text. While the author notes the potential for violence and war over the issue of slavery, they do not argue that women should oppose war; rather, they argue for women's involvement in the slavery issue (regardless of whether men act out a potentially violent campaign in response). 
Thought:
The passage argues for women's involvement in the political issue of slavery. Smith argues that women's participation in opposing slavery does not negatively impact their gender expression, nor require them to be politically neutral. Therefore, women can engage in arguing for liberty or slavery through humanitarian, moral, and religious principles without losing their femininity.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the role of women in discussing the issue of slavery.
  A: The author argues that women can engage in humanitarian principles while still being feminine.
  B: The author argues against the idea that women can't involve themselves in politics due to them needing to adhere to personal morality.
  C: The passage does not discuss women contributing to their families' financial security while meeting social expectations.
  D: The passage does not mention calls for war and how women can resist them while opposing slavery.
Thought: 
  The passage argues that women should be involved in the discussion of slavery.
  The author mentions that women can have a "meek and quiet spirit" while also being involved in an important political discussion of freedom.
  Therefore, the author is arguing that women can be politically engaged without losing their femininity or adherence to personal morality.
  The best answer is A: Acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. The author argues that women can be involved in matters of political importance, like emancipation and abolition, without sacrificing what the author calls their "appropriate ornaments" of modesty and gentleness, which are traditionally associated with femininity. 
  This means that women can act according to humanitarian principles while still being feminine, and thus the best answer is A: Acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the topic of slavery and women's involvement in its discussion.
  A: The author argues that it is possible for women to engage in activities relating to humanitarian principles and maintain their femininity.
  B: The author does not argue that women should maintain political neutrality.
  C: The author does not discuss women's contribution to their family's financial security.
  D: The author does not discuss the topic of war, but the passage discusses the effects of slavery and the moral obligations to abolish it.

Thought:
  Smith argues that women can engage in the discussion of slavery and adhere to principles of justice, humanity, morality and religion.
  The passage also argues that women have a moral obligation to abolish the slavery system and protect the interest of the family, the country, and their fellow beings.
  The author makes no mention of women's financial contributions to the family.

Therefore, based on the above analysis, the correct answer is A: Acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The author is arguing that women have a stake in the issue of slavery.
  The author refutes the claim that discussing slavery is not within "the province of women."
  The Constitution of the United States requires the suppression of slave insurrections by force.
  The passage argues against slavery as a moral and political question.
Thought:
  The author argues that women can act on behalf of humanity while not losing their feminine qualities.
  Thus, the argument suggests political neutrality, adhering to personal morality, or worrying about the family's financial security are not the only options.
  Women can resist calls for war while opposing slavery.
  Furthermore, the author explicitly states that women have a stake in the issue of slavery.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the passage regarding either option C: Contributing to their family's financial security while meeting social expectations, or option D: Resisting calls for war while still opposing slavery. 
  However, given the passage's emphasis on women's moral and human dignity, it is reasonable to assume that women can contribute to their family's financial security or resist calls for war while still opposing slavery.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: The passage presents an argument that it is not beyond a woman's place or capabilities to engage in the discussion of slavery. The author argues that the subject of slavery is not merely a political question and woman could be disallowed to discuss it just because it is outside their sphere or province. Further, the author presents the idea that woman could still keep their "modesty and gentleness," and remain feminine while being interested in the subject, because it involves humane and moral considerations.
Thought: 
  The author presents the idea that women can be interested in and engage in the topic of slavery while retaining their being "meek and quiet-spirited," feminine, or even merely adhering to her personal morality that includes compassion to humanity. The author argues that freedom is not just a political matter but also a humane and social one wherein the rights of laborers are involved. Thus, the call to address it is not just for politicians but for individuals as well. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: Acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the limitations placed on women when discussing the subject of slavery.
  Smith argues that women should not be limited in discussing the subject as it touches on the considerations of justice, humanity, morality, and religion.
  Smith argues that women should take an active part in the opposition of slavery and the attainment of freedom for the oppressed, even if it's a political question.
Thought: 
  Smith argues that women can be actively engaged in being humanitarians and contribute to the attainment of justice and freedom while still being feminine.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the passage that Smith discusses financial security, social expectations, or war resistence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the subject of slavery and its impact.
  The author argues that women have a moral obligation to oppose slavery.
  The author claims that women can be humane and gentle while supporting abolitionism.
Thought: 
  The author highlights that slavery is not just a political issue but a moral and humane issue, and women should oppose it.
  Women can be moral and sensitive to humanitarian issues while supporting the abolition of slavery.
  Therefore, there is no reason why women cannot be politically active in the fight against slavery while keeping their femininity.
  The answer is A: Acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not address women engaging in activities to improve their family's financial security or meeting social expectations.
  The passage is not about women resisting calls for war, but rather how women can still be engaged in political issues like the abolition of slavery while maintaining their femininity.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the role of women in discussing the subject of slavery and whether it is a political question or a moral question.
  A: The author argues that it is a question of justice, humanity, morality, and religion to discuss slavery, and that women can partake in the discussion and be both humanitarian and feminine.
  B: The author argues that slavery is not just a political question, but also a moral question, and implies that women can't afford to be politically neutral.
  C: The passage does not discuss ways for women to contribute to their family's financial security.
  D: The author argues that when men go to war to suppress insurrections by the enslaved population, women should resist calls for war but should work to end slavery.
Thought: 
  The passage argues that women can contribute to the cause of ending slavery, and that this is not just a political question but a moral and humanitarian issue, so answer A could be correct. Also, the passage implies that women should not be neutral but should take a stand on the issue, so answer B is less likely to be correct. Answer C is also unlikely since the passage does not discuss women contributing financially or meeting social expectations. Answer D only partly captures the message since Smith does not believe that women should resist calls for war to defend slavery. So, answer A is the best option.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect
Question: The passage most strongly suggests that if collisionalerosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient toexplain the situation discussed in the passage, then,as a result, scientists would expect to find that
Choices:
  A: Vesta is not the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt.
  B: the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
  C: iron fragments in the asteroid belt tend to be smaller than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
  D: there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," which is the rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt.
  The passage suggests that collisional erosion cannot be the whole story and that primitive asteroids, which are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids, survived when almost none of the differentiated ones did.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that collisional erosion cannot fully explain the missing mantle problem.
  If collisional erosion was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find far fewer primitive asteroids than there currently are.
  However, the passage states that the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt and that most of these objects survived.
  Therefore, if collisional erosion was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find far fewer primitive asteroids than there currently are, and this contradicts what the passage says.
  The passage does not suggest anything about Vesta being the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt or about the size of iron fragments compared to rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
  The passage suggests that differentiated asteroids were relatively rare to begin with, and there were not as many primitive asteroids as there were differentiated ones in the asteroid belt. However, the passage also notes that none of the differentiated ones survived, so this does not contradict the statement that there are more intact primitive bodies in the asteroid belt than there are differentiated ones.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," which refers to the rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite collection and the asteroid belt.
  The author suggests that collisional erosion cannot be the whole story and theorizes that perhaps most differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions and the surviving fragments were scattered into the asteroid belt.
Thought: 
  If collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the rarity of mantle rocks, then we would expect to find a smaller number of primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt as well.
  This is because, according to the passage, both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
  Therefore, if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the missing mantle problem, then there would have been more destruction of all types of asteroids in the asteroid belt, including primitive ones.
  Thus, we would expect to find a smaller number of primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt than what we currently observe.
  Therefore, the answer is B: the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence or suggestion in the passage that Vesta is not the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt (choice A).
  The passage discusses the rarity of mantle rocks and iron meteorites, not the relative sizes of iron and rocky fragments in the asteroid belt (choice C).
  There is also no evidence or suggestion in the passage that there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt (choice D).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," which is the rarity of mantles from differentiated asteroids in our meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt.
  The passage suggests that collisional erosion within the asteroid belt might be a factor in the missing mantle problem.
Thought:
  If collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find that rocky fragments in the asteroid belt tend to be smaller than iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
  This is because rocky material lies near the surface of a differentiated asteroid and will be the first to be removed when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron lies in the core and is the last to be exposed.
Criticism:
  The question asks what scientists would expect to find if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the missing mantle problem, but the passage does not provide a definitive answer to this question.
  The passage does suggest that rocky fragments in the asteroid belt tend to be smaller than iron fragments due to the way in which asteroids break apart, but it is not clear whether this is what scientists would expect to find if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the missing mantle problem.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," which is the rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt. 
  Iron fragments are more likely to survive in space than rocky fragments due to their position within a differentiated asteroid and their strength. 
  Primitive asteroids, which are parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
Thought: 
  If collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then it would mean that almost all differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions.
  If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in the solar system and none have survived, it would mean that Vesta is the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt.
  If all mantle material has been ground down to dust and lost over billions of years, it would mean there are far fewer primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  Therefore, if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find that there are far fewer primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt than it currently does.
  The answer is B: the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does. 
Criticism: 
  There is no reason to expect Vesta to not be the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt even if collisional erosion is not the main reason for the missing mantle. 
  Iron fragments tend to be stronger than rocky fragments, but there is no information in the passage to suggest that they are generally smaller than rocky fragments. 
  The passage does not provide information to suggest that there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," which is the scarcity of mantle rocks in our meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt. The passage suggests that most differentiated asteroids may have broken apart early in the solar system, leaving intact differentiated asteroids like Vesta very rare today. Collisional erosion may have played a role, but is not the whole explanation for the missing mantle problem. Some iron fragments have survived better than rocky fragments over the age of the solar system because iron is stronger than rock. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids, but somehow many primitive asteroids survived while almost none of the differentiated ones did.
Thought: 
  If collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the missing mantle problem, then scientists would expect to find that many differentiated asteroids were destroyed in violent collisions. This might mean that Vesta is not the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt and there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  Therefore, the answer is D: there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," which is the rarity of mantle rocks in the meteorite collection and the asteroid belt.
  Collisional erosion may not be the only explanation for this problem.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the missing mantle problem, then scientists would expect that almost all of the differentiated asteroids would have been destroyed in violent collisions.
  Consequently, they would expect to find far fewer primitive asteroids than currently exist.
  The answer is B: the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
Criticism: 
  Your interpretation is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" in the asteroid belt, where rocky fragments have to survive in space for longer than iron ones since iron is much stronger than rock.
  Most of the rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments - chips from the surface - while the iron core remains as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later.
  The rarity of mantle rocks in the meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt is a long-standing puzzle.
  Vesta is a differentiated asteroid with a diameter of more than 300 miles, and a handful of differentiated asteroids may be all that remains in the asteroid belt.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then there are several possibilities for what scientists would expect to find, but we can consider each answer choice in turn:
  A: The passage doesn't suggest that the number of differentiated asteroids is related to the expected number of large differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt; therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.
  B: The passage suggests that the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt, and most of these objects survived. This means that if almost all of the differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions, then it is possible that only a few bodies survived. Therefore, the expected number of primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt may not be affected by this scenario. Thus, this answer choice is also incorrect.
  C: The passage states that rocky fragments have to survive in space for longer than iron ones, which suggests that iron fragments may be larger than rocky fragments. However, the passage doesn't imply that iron fragments in the asteroid belt tend to be smaller than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt. Therefore, this answer choice is also incorrect.
  D: The passage implies that almost all the differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions within the asteroid belt, leaving only a few differentiated asteroids. Therefore, there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt. Thus, this answer choice is the best among the given choices.
Criticism:
  There is no clear indication in the passage that collisional erosion would be sufficient to explain the situation discussed. The passage discusses several hypotheses and possibilities and doesn't suggest that collisional erosion is the only explanation for the situation. Additionally, while there is some discussion about the expected number of differentiated asteroids and primitive asteroids, the passage primarily focuses on the properties of iron and rocky fragments when explaining why the missing mantle problem is a long-standing puzzle. Therefore, the question seems to be asking for a more specific answer than what the passage provides.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," which is the rarity of mantle rocks in the meteorite collection and asteroid belt. 
  Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from the cores of asteroids, while the mantle rocks of these asteroids are missing.
  Iron is stronger than rock, so iron fragments may survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart.
  Primitive asteroids (the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites) are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids but have survived in the asteroid belt.
Thought: 
  The passage considers the possibility that collisional erosion could explain the rarity of mantle rocks. 
  If most differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions and primitive asteroids are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids, then it would be expected that most primitive asteroids would also be destroyed in violent collisions. 
  Therefore, if collisional erosion was sufficient to explain the missing mantle problem, then scientists would expect to find that the asteroid belt had far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
  The answer is B: the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
Criticism: 
  There are no indications in the passage that the missing mantle problem and the number of primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt are the same issue. Thus, Option B cannot be the only answer. 
  The passage also does not provide strong support for Option A, C or D.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
   The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem," which is the rarity of mantle rocks from asteroids in our meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt. 
   Rocky material lies near the surface of an asteroid, while iron lies in the core. When an asteroid is bombarded, the rocky material is the first to be removed. 
   Iron fragments are stronger than rocky fragments and are likely to survive in space for at least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the same size.
   Many differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions, and gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt. 
Thought: 
   If collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the rarity of mantle rocks, then rocky material would have been completely destroyed or altered to an unidentifiable form, leaving no primitive asteroids.  
   Therefore, if almost all differentiated bodies were destroyed by violent collisions, the asteroid belt today would have fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
   Therefore, the correct answer should be B: the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
Criticism: 
   None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem", which is the rarity of mantle rocks in the meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt.
  The passage suggests that collisional erosion may explain the missing mantle problem, but only in part, as primitive asteroids (the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites) are not stronger than mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed, then the asteroid belt would have far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
  This is because as a result of violent collisions, most differentiated bodies would not have survived, but the parent bodies of primitive asteroids did.
  Therefore, if violent collisions were sufficient to explain the missing mantle problem, then there would be fewer primitive asteroids than there are currently.
  The passage does not suggest any relationship between the size of iron fragments and rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
  The passage does not provide information to determine whether Vesta is the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt or not.
  The passage suggests that differentiated asteroids were relatively rare to begin with, but it does not suggest that there were originally equal numbers of differentiated and primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  Therefore, the answer is B: the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage suggests there would be far fewer primitive asteroids if collisional erosion was sufficient to explain the missing mantle problem.
  And the answer is not A, C, or D because the passage does not provide any information to support any of them.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Many millennia before the invention of herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a  valuable part of an integrated weed-management 5 program. Although plowing kills standing weeds, farmers have long known that it often leads to the emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.Ecologists have shown that a farmer's field can have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter 10 buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists have shown that seeds buried more than about one centimeter below the soil surface do not receive enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow, which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil15 surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the surface where their germination is induced by exposure to sunlight?Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a 20 relatively simple experiment, they went to ten different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then25 exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples, weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives weed seeds a "light break," and this stimulates their 30 germination.More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen University in Germany reasoned that when farmers plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is35 turned over, and that this stimulates their germination. Although the light exposures from plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the germination of weed seeds would be minimized if40 farmers simply plowed their fields during the night, when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which photons hit the surface] is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second. Although even under these conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike 45 each square millimeter of ground each second, this illumination is below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when he first came up with this idea because he assumed 50 that such a simple method of weed control as plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated 55 that the method can be effective.Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip60 at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas 65 only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.This method of weed control is currently being used by several farmers in Germany.

Question: The passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been
Choices:
  A: lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
  B: higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.
  C: nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
  D: comparable to Hartmann's original projection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Karl Hartmann of Erlangen University in Germany conducted an experiment where he plowed two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany, one during the day and the other at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments.
  Hartmann found that more than 80% of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  It is not mentioned in the passage if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment.
Thought:
  From the passage, we can infer that the presence or absence of crops (wheat or corn) on the agricultural strips would have influenced the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds.
  However, it is not explicitly mentioned in the passage whether this percentage would have been higher or lower.
  Without more information, it is difficult to determine whether Seydel's planting of wheat or corn would have increased or decreased the percentage of weeds.
  Therefore, option C, "nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine," is the most likely answer.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The method of weed control proposed by Hartmann involves plowing fields at night instead of during the day.
  This is because plowing during the day can briefly expose buried weed seeds to sunlight, stimulating their germination.
  Hartmann's pilot experiment showed that plowing at night resulted in significantly fewer weeds than plowing during the day.
  No crops were planted in Hartmann's experiment, to avoid interference with weed growth.
Thought:
  Hartmann's experiment showed that plowing at night resulted in a much lower proportion of weed growth than plowing during the day.
  No crops were planted in Hartmann's experiment, so the weed growth was not being suppressed by crop growth.
  If crops were planted, they would suppress the growth of weeds to some extent.
  Therefore, if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been even lower than what Hartmann found.
  The answer is A: lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes an experiment by Karl Hartmann where plowing at night versus during the day results in significant differences in weed growth.
  The experiment was performed without planting any crops to avoid competition with weeds.
  It is unclear how the presence of crops would affect the outcome of the experiment.
Thought:
  The experiment conducted by Hartmann showed a significant reduction in weeds when plowing was done at night.
  However, no crops were planted, so it is unclear how this method would fare with crops.
  The passage does not provide any evidence that the presence of crops would significantly alter the results of the experiment.
  Therefore, it is difficult to determine with certainty what the effect of crops would be on the results.
  The answer is C: nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
Criticism:
  It is possible that the presence of crops could have affected the growth of weeds and thus Hartmann might have been able to determine the effect.
  However, the passage does not provide any support one way or the other.
  Therefore, it is still most likely that the answer is C: nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The experiment conducted by Hartmann involved plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany.
  No crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
Thought: 
  The experiment conducted by Hartmann showed that plowing at night minimized the germination of weed seeds.
  The experiment involved two agricultural strips without any crops.
  If crops had been present, they would have competed with the weeds.
  Therefore, the experiment likely overstates the effectiveness of nighttime plowing in crop fields.
  The percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted if there were crops present.
  The answer is B: higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The experiment conducted by Hartmann in Germany involved plowing two agricultural strips without planting any crops in them to avoid any competition. The experiment demonstrated that plowing at night was an effective method to control weeds.
Thought: The experiment results showed that plowing at night resulted in only 2% of the field area being covered by weeds, whereas plowing at mid-ay resulted in more than 80% of the field area being covered by weeds. Since no crops were planted during the experiment, it can be assumed that the weeds grew on the bare ground. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, it would have provided competition to the emerging weeds and could have reduced the percentage of surface area covered by weeds on both strips.
Therefore, the answer is A: lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The experiment was conducted to study the effectiveness of plowing fields at night to control weeds.
  Plowing during the day can stimulate the germination of weed seeds by exposing them to sunlight.
  In the experiment, the strips were left unplanted to avoid competition with weeds.
Thoughts:
  If the strips were planted with wheat or corn, there would be competition for resources, and weeds might still grow but at a lower rate.
  So, the percentage of the surface of the strip covered with weeds would likely be lower than the percentage Hartmann found.
  Therefore, the answer is A: lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
Criticism:
  This is a reasonable inference, but the experiment was not conducted to test the effect of planting crops on weed growth.
  It is possible that planting crops might not have affected the percentage of weed coverage on the strips, or it might have increased the percentage of weed coverage significantly.
  So, the answer is not certain.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann in Germany.
  The experiment involved plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany to control weeds.
  In the pilot experiment, karl Seydel cultivated one strip repeated threefold at around midday and the other strip at night. 
  No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  The results of the experiment were that more than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
Thought: 
  The experiment did not involve crops being planted in the plowed fields
  Hartmann found that the strip plowed during the day had more weeds than the strip plowed at night.
  If Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the agricultural strips, competition from the crops with the weeds would reduce the effectiveness of the weed control
  Therefore, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would have been higher than what Hartmann found because of the competition from the crops.
  The answer is B: higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted. 
Criticism: 
  There is nothing in the passage to suggest that Hartmann predicted a different percentage from what he found. 
  However, there is nothing in the passage to suggest that Hartmann predicted anything at all. 
  Suggesting that Hartmann predicted anything is a misreading of the text.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The experiment involved plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. One strip was plowed at midday, and the other at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
Thought: The experiment showed that plowing the field at night significantly decreased the number of weeds that grew. However, the experiment did not involve planting any crops in the agricultural strips. It is difficult to predict definitively whether planting crops would increase or decrease weed growth. One could assume that planting crops would decrease weed growth because the crops would compete with the weeds for light, water, and nutrients. Therefore the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds if crops were planted would be less than the percentage Hartmann found if no crops were planted.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Hartmann conducted an experiment where he plowed two agricultural strips, one around midday and the other at night.
  No crops were planted in the field strips during the experiment to avoid possible competition with emerging weeds.
  More than 80% of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
Thought: 
  The experiment was conducted without planting any crops on the agricultural strips during the experiment, so no crop interferences are present. 
  Therefore, if Seydel had planted crops, the yield on the night-plowed strip would not likely have succeeded at the same rate as during the experiment by Hartmann.
  Thus, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would be much higher than Hartmann's original projection.
  The answer is B: higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.
Criticism: 
  The experiment by Hartmann was conducted only for a brief period so making an assumption that there would be no crop interferences under real farming conditions is not fully validated.
  Thus, there could be different results for real farming conditions compared to the sympathetic experiment conducted by Hartmann.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The experiment conducted by Hartmann involved plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany.
  One strip was plowed during the day and the other strip was plowed at night.
  No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
Thought:
  The experiment conducted by Hartmann did not involve planting any crops in the plowed strips.
  Therefore, it is impossible to know with certainty what would have happened if crops were planted.
  However, the passage does mention that if the emerging weeds were left uncontrolled on the daytime plowed strip, they would have covered more than 80 percent of the surface of the field, which suggests that they could potentially have outcompeted any planted crops.
  Therefore, it is likely that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would have been higher than the percentage that Hartmann found.
  The answer is B: higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.
Criticism:
  There is no direct evidence in the passage to support the idea that the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would have been higher than Hartmann found if crops were planted, so the answer may not be completely certain.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, "Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."40 He picked up a bird shape: "Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought." He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: "Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind."As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. "Look here," Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. "See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this." And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. "The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price."I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

  The passage is about a family who runs an ink-making business.
  The protagonist of the story listens to her father's conversation with a customer about the different qualities of inksticks.
  The father emphasizes that good ink requires effort, intention, and balance, and that it can be recognized by its hue, sound, and scent.
Thought:
  The father's conversation suggests that quality is achieved through deliberate effort, intention, and balance, rather than by chance or convenience.
  This theme is reinforced by the protagonist's memory of her aunt's teaching that everything, including ink, has a purpose and a meaning, and that one must push oneself to think and to ask what is in one's heart that matches one's mind in order to cleanse one's thoughts and feelings.
  The protagonist is also proud of her family's hard work in making quality ink and of her father's skillful presentation of their product, suggesting that hard work results in material compensation and social recognition.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.
Question: In Passage 1, Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely
Choices:
  A: overlooked, because few men are interested in women's thoughts about politics.
  B: indirect, because women exert their influence within the home and family life.
  C: unnecessary, because men are able to govern society themselves.
  D: symbolic, because women tend to be more idealistic about politics than men are.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the role of women in society and how they can gain influence and power.
  A: Option A is not described in the passage. There is no evidence to suggest that few men are interested in women's thoughts about politics.
  B: Option B is mentioned in the passage. It states that women have an all-pervading influence on society but the mode of gaining influence and exercising power is different.
  C: Option C is not described in the passage. There is no statement made that implies men should solely govern society without women's participation. 
  D: Option D is not described in the passage. There is no mention of women being more idealistic about politics than men.
Thought: 
  The passage states that women have an important role in society but the mode of gaining influence and power is different from men. 
  It also suggests that women can exercise power through the kindly, generous, peaceful, and benevolent principles. 
  The passage emphasizes the idea that women's influence and power is not direct but all-pervading and largely within the domestic and social circle. 
  Therefore, option B seems to be the best answer since it directly describes the women's role in society according to the passage. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes the relationship between men and women in society as one of subordination for women and superiority for men.
  According to Beecher in Passage 1, women's duty is to gain influence and exercise power in a different, more peaceful way that appeals to benevolent principles.
  In Passage 2, Grimké discusses her belief that women have the same rights and moral nature as men, and that whatever is morally right for men to do is also morally right for women to do.
Thought: 
  In Passage 1, Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely indirect, because they exert their influence within the home and family life.
  Beecher does not suggest that women's thoughts about politics are unimportant or that they are overlooked by men.
  Beecher also does not suggest that women's influence on public life is merely symbolic or idealistic.
  These ideas are not directly related to the content of Passage 1.
  Therefore, the most logical answer is B: indirect, because women exert their influence within the home and family life.
Criticism: 
  While it is true that Beecher discusses women's role in the domestic sphere in Passage 1, he does not explicitly state that women's effect on public life is largely indirect.
  This is more of an interpretation of Beecher's views than a direct statement from him.
  Therefore, it is possible that another answer choice could be valid based on a different interpretation of the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the roles of men and women in society and the modes of gaining influence and power.
  Passage 2 discusses the investigation of the speaker's own rights and the Anti-Slavery cause as a high school of morals.
Thought:
  Passage 1 argues that women hold a subordinate relation to men in society, but their duties and influence are no less important. Women gain influence and power through different modes than men, appealing to kind, generous, peaceful, and benevolent principles.
  Passage 2 argues that all humans have rights because of their shared moral nature. Gender does not give men higher rights or responsibilities than women. 
  Neither passage suggests that women's effect on public life is largely symbolic, nor that it is unnecessary or overlooked because men are interested or able to govern society themselves. Passage 1 suggests that women exert their influence in different ways than men, primarily within the domestic and social circle.
  The closest answer choice to the passage is B: indirect, because women exert their influence within the home and family life. However, this does not completely capture the argument in the passage as women are argued to have an important role in society, just through different means. 
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that women have an important but different role in society than men. 
  Women hold a subordinate relation in society, but their duties and influence are still important.
  Women's power is different from men's power and must appeal to different principles.
Thought: 
  In Passage 1, Beecher argues that women have an important but different role in society than men.
  Beecher suggests that women's power is different from men's power and must appeal to different principles. 
  Beecher argues that women's influence is largely indirect and exerted within the home and family life.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: indirect because women exert their influence within the home and family life.
Criticism: 
  Your understanding of Passage 1 is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 argues that women should conform to their subordinate role in society.
  The power that women have is different than that of men, and appeals to different principles.
  Passage 2 argues that men and women have essentially the same moral nature and therefore essentially the same rights.
Thoughts:
  Passage 1 argues that women have an important but indirect and non-aggressive role in society.
  Passage 2 argues for the equal rights of men and women.
  Neither passage implies that women's effect on public life is largely overlooked, unnecessary, or symbolic.
  Therefore, the answer must be B: indirect, because women exert their influence within the home and family life.
Criticism:
  My thoughts seem reasonable based on the information provided.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes the differing roles of men and women in society.
  According to Passage 1, women are subordinate to men in society.
  While women's duties and influence are still important, they are meant to be exercised differently than men.
Thought: 
  In Passage 1, Beecher argues that women are meant to influence society differently than men.
  According to Beecher, women are meant to exert influence through "kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles."
  This means that women's effect on public life is largely indirect, and takes place within the home and family life.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: indirect, because women exert their influence within the home and family life.
Criticism: 
  I have evaluated the passage and correctly analyzed Beecher's argument and perspective.
  Therefore, there are no flaws in this answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the nature of women's influence and their role in society.
  A: No information is provided to indicate Beecher believes men are uninterested in women's thoughts about politics.
  B: Beecher argues that women's influence is all-pervading, and that it is designed to be different from men's but not less important or less powerful.
  C: Beecher does not argue that men are the only ones who can govern society.
  D: No information is provided to indicate women are more idealistic about politics than men.
Thought: 
  According to Passage 1, women hold a subordinate station in society, and their influence is to be achieved through different modes of gaining power than men. Thus, Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely indirect, because women exert their influence within the home and family life.
  The answer is B: indirect.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that Beecher argues that women's influence is designed to be different from men's but not less important or less powerful. However, this does not necessarily mean that women's influence is primarily exerted within the home and family life. Although Beecher does argue that women should focus on becoming cultivated and refined in intellect and benevolent in feeling and action, she also suggests that women can seek the aid of co-operation and combination among their own sex to assist them in their appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal, and domestic duty. Thus, it is possible that women could exert their influence outside the home as well.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 argues that women are subordinate to men but that their duties and influence are important.
  It suggests that women should win power and influence through peaceful and benevolent means, rather than coercion and competition.
Thought:
  Passage 1 suggests that women's influence on public life is indirect, because they exert their power within the domestic and social sphere.
  It argues that women's power should be based on benevolent and peaceful principles
  Therefore, Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely indirect and benevolent.
  The best answer is B: indirect, because women exert their influence within the home and family life.
Criticism:
  Your analysis is correct. 
  There is no indication in Passage 1 that Beecher believes women's influence is overlooked, unnecessary, or purely symbolic.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the role of women in society and their method of exercising power.
  A: This is not discussed in Passage 1.
  B: According to Passage 1, women's power and conquests are lawful and all-pervading, but exercised in a different and peculiar way than men's power.
  C: Passage 1 does not suggest that women's influence is unnecessary or that men are the only ones who can govern society.
  D: Passage 1 does not discuss the differences between men and women's idealism about politics.
Thought: 
  Passage 1 suggests that women hold a subordinate position in society to men, but that their duties and influence are still important and all-pervading.
  Women's unique power is exercised mainly in the domestic and social circle.
  Therefore, Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely indirect, as they exert influence mainly through their roles in the home and family.
  The answer is B: indirect.
Criticism: 
  Beecher is not explicitly mentioned in Passage 1 as discussing women's effect on public life.
  However, the passage does suggest that women's power is exercised mainly in the domestic and social circle, so it could be inferred that their effect on public life is largely indirect.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the nature of women's power, and how it is different from men's power. 
  A: Choice A is not mentioned in Passage 1.
  B: Beecher argues that women's power is indirect and comes from within the home and family life in Passage 1.
  C: Passage 1 does not state that women's effect on public life is unnecessary.
  D: Beecher does not mention whether women tend to be more idealistic about politics than men in Passage 1.
Thought: 
  Beecher believes that women's power is indirect, and that they influence society through the home and family life.
  He argues that women have an important role to play in society, and that their influence is not less important or pervasive than men's.
  Therefore, Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely indirect, through their influence on the home and family life.
  The answer is B: indirect.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is logical.
  The answer B correctly reflects Beecher's argument that women's influence on public life is largely indirect, through their influence on the home and family life.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.
Question: nothingness") Which choice best states the relationship between the two passages?
Choices:
  A: Passage 2 illustrates the practical difficulties of a proposal made in Passage 1.
  B: Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.
  C: Passage 2 provides a historical context for the perspective offered in Passage 1.
  D: Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the role of women in society and the importance of them conforming to their subordinate position in a peaceful and loving way.
  Passage 2 discusses the author's belief that human rights are based on moral beings and advocates for gender equality in the context of the anti-slavery movement.
Thought:
  The two passages both discuss the concept of equality from different perspectives.
  Passage 1 focuses on the role of women in society and advocates for peaceful and loving ways of gaining influence and power.
  Passage 2 discusses the author's belief that all humans have the same moral nature and should have the same rights, including women.
  There is no mention in Passage 2 of Passage 1, so it cannot take issue with it or provide historical context for it.
  While Passage 2 does expand upon the idea of equality, it does not seem to be elaborating upon anything implied in Passage 1.
  Therefore, the best choice is B: Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.
Criticism:
  The interpretation that Passage 2 takes issue with Passage 1 may be too strong. 
  Although there is a difference in perspective, it is not necessarily an oppositional one. 
  As such, the most accurate answer would be D: Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 explores the role of women in society and outlines a vision for their influence and power that is different from men.
  Passage 2 reflects on the rights of slaves and argues that human beings have inherent rights based on their moral nature.
Thought:
  Both passages seem to share a similar theme of advocating for the rights and empowerment of a marginalized group.
  While Passage 1 focuses on women and Passage 2 focuses on slaves, both passages argue that these groups are entitled to certain rights and dignities because of their moral nature.
  However, the specifics of their arguments and proposals are different.
  Passage 1 focuses on women's power being rooted in peace, love, and domestic influence, while Passage 2 seems to argue for more direct action in the pursuit of moral rights.
  Additionally, Passage 1 doesn't mention anything about slavery or the abolition movement, so it seems unlikely that Passage 2 is providing historical context for it.
  Choice A doesn't seem to apply because Passage 2 doesn't mention anything about the specific proposal in Passage 1, and Choice B seems like the closest option, but it's still not a perfect fit.
  Choice D is a possibility because both passages share a similar focus on moral nature and rights, but it could be argued that Passage 2 is expanding upon these topics in a more philosophical way than Passage 1 does.
  Overall, none of these choices seems like a perfect fit, but the closest one seems to be D: Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1.
Criticism:
  There is a clear thematic connection between the two passages, but it's not entirely clear how closely related their ideas are.
  Passage 1 focuses more on gender roles and relationships, while Passage 2 takes a broader philosophical and ethical approach to human rights.
  So while D might be the closest option, it's still not entirely accurate.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 argues that women should conform to their subordinate position in society but still exercise important influence through peaceful means.
  Passage 2 is a response to an argument made by someone else and discusses the Anti-Slavery cause as a high school of morals where human rights are fully investigated.
  Passage 2 argues that human beings have rights because they are moral beings and that the circumstance of sex does not give men higher rights and responsibilities than women.
Thought:
  The two passages seem to be discussing different topics. 
  Passage 1 discusses the role of women in society and how they can exercise influence through peaceful means. 
  Passage 2 discusses the Anti-Slavery movement and argues that human beings have essential rights based on their moral nature, regardless of their sex. 
  There is no clear indication that Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1, nor does it provide a historical context for the perspective offered in Passage 1.
  Similarly, while there may be some overlap in the ideas of the passages (e.g. the idea that peaceful means of influence are powerful), Passage 2 does not simply elaborate upon several ideas implied in Passage 1. 
  The best choice seems to be A: Passage 2 illustrates the practical difficulties of a proposal made in Passage 1. 
  While the two passages are not directly connected, this option provides the most plausible link between them by suggesting that the ideas of Passage 1 may face difficulties in practice, which are demonstrated and discussed from a different perspective in Passage 2.
Criticism:
  While the answer choice A may have some merit, there is no clear indication in Passage 2 that it is intended to illustrate the practical difficulties of a proposal made in Passage 1. 
  Rather, Passage 2 seems to be focused on a different topic altogether, and while it may be drawing on similar ideas (e.g. the importance of moral principles), it is not directly engaging with the proposal made in Passage 1.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The first passage discusses the role of women and their sphere of influence and power in society.
  The second passage discusses the moral rights of all human beings and the equal value of men and women.
Thought:
  The two passages are discussing different topics and do not seem to have a direct relationship.
  Passage 1 does not mention slavery or human rights, which are the main topics of Passage 2.
  Passage 2 does not mention the role of women in society or their sphere of influence, which are the main topics of Passage 1.
  Therefore, the two passages do not have a direct relationship.
  None of the answer choices seems to best state the relationship between the two passages.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the two passages are discussing different topics and do not seem to have a direct relationship.
  However, while the two passages may not directly relate to each other, they are both related to the broader theme of civil rights and equality.
  Passage 1 focuses on the role of women in society and the importance of conforming to their subordinate position, while Passage 2 argues for the equal rights and moral worth of all human beings.
  One could argue that both passages are contributing to a larger conversation about civil rights and equality, albeit from different perspectives.
  Based on this broader context, answer choice D seems to best state the relationship between the two passages, as Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that women have important duties and influence in society, but that they should operate within different boundaries than men. 
  Passage 2 argues that women have the same rights as men and should have the same opportunities and duties. 
Thought: 
  Both passages are concerned with the role of women in society, but they take different perspectives. 
  Passage 1 argues that women have important duties and influence, but that they should use different methods than men. 
  Passage 2 argues that women have the same rights as men and should be able to do whatever is morally right, regardless of their sex. 
  They address similar ideas about the nature of women's role in society, but offer different solutions. 
  Therefore, Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1. 
  The correct answer is D: Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence to suggest that Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1. 
  Nor does it provide a historical context for the perspective offered in Passage 1. 
  Additionally, while Passage 2 offers a different perspective on women's rights than Passage 1, it does not illustrate the practical difficulties of a proposal made in Passage 1. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: Passage 1 argues that women have a subordinate station in society that is different from men, and that their power comes from being peaceful, benevolent, and well-respected. Passage 2 argues that the rights of all humans are rooted in their moral nature and that men and women should have the same rights and responsibilities. 
Thought: 
  The passages appear to address different topics - Passage 1 is about gender roles and the power of women in society, while Passage 2 is about human rights. 
  There is no indication that Passage 2 is responding directly to Passage 1 or taking issue with its primary argument. 
  Passage 2 does elaborate on the idea that moral nature is central to human rights, which is suggested in Passage 1. 
  Therefore, D: Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1, seems to be the most accurate choice. 
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the role of women in society and how they can exercise power and influence in a different way than men.
  Passage 2 discusses the rights of slaves and how understanding those rights led the author to a belief in the equality of men and women.
Thought:
  The two passages address different topics and there is no clear indication that one is responding to the other.
  Passage 2 does not directly contradict or refute any of the argument made in Passage 1.
  However, both passages address issues related to equality and human rights.
  Passage 2 can be seen as expanding upon the argument made in Passage 1 by applying it to another group of oppressed people, slaves.
  Therefore, the best choice is D: Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1.
Criticism:
  Your answer is correct. Both passages are connected in that they both discuss the issue of unequal treatment of groups that belong to a particular set. However, there is no evidence suggesting that Passage 2 is a direct response to Passage 1. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that women hold a subordinate station in society to men but can still have important influence through kindness and benevolence. 
  Passage 2 reflects on the Anti-Slavery movement and argues that rights are based on moral nature, not sex, and that women have the same rights as men.
Thought:
  The two passages discuss different topics: Passage 1 discusses women's role in society while Passage 2 discusses the Anti-Slavery movement and women's rights.
  Although there are some similarities in the themes of the two passages, they do not address the same topic.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1.
Criticism:
  Upon further analysis, there is no evidence within the passages that supports the idea that Passage 2 elaborates upon any ideas implied in Passage 1.
  In fact, there is no mention of passage 1 whatsoever within Passage 2, hence there is no relationship between the two passages.
  Therefore, the best answer is "None of the Above."
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 is about the role and duties of women in society.
  Passage 2 is about the anti-slavery movement and human rights.
Thought: 
  There is no clear indication in Passage 2 that it is directly responding to or taking issue with Passage 1.
  While Passage 1 focuses on the role of women, Passage 2 is about a different topic - the anti-slavery movement and human rights.
  Although both passages discuss the general topic of human rights, they do not clearly relate to each other.
  Thus, none of the answer choices seem to accurately describe the relationship between the two passages.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 talks about the role of women in society.
  Passage 2 talks about the rights of slaves and women.
Thought:
  Passage 2 is not directly responding to Passage 1.
  It does not take issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.
  It does not provide a historical context for the perspective offered in Passage 1.
  It does, however, elaborate upon several ideas implied in Passage 1, specifically the idea that rights are founded in the moral being and that sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities than to women.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1.
Criticism:
  There is no indication that Passage 2 is specifically elaborating on ideas implied in Passage 1. However, both passages share similarities in their discussions about moral beings and their respective rights.
  It is possible that Passage 2 is offering a different perspective to the argument made in Passage 1, so answer choice B cannot be completely ruled out.
  Nonetheless, as the best answer among the choices, D remains as the most likely answer.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

Question: The passage most strongly suggests that beekeepers' attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides have what unintentional effect?
Choices:
  A: They increase certain mite populations.
  B: They kill some beneficial forms of bacteria.
  C: They destroy bees' primary food source.
  D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how commercial bee colonies that are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient and this can lead to fatal mite infections.
  Synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids and are used as insecticides.
  The passage suggests that introducing commercial insecticides into bee hives can lead to harmful effects on the bees.
Thought:
  The passage states that insecticides introduced by beekeepers to fight mite infestation can harm the health of some bees.
  Therefore, the answer is D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct based on the information given in the passage. 
  However, the passage does not support the other options.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the problems caused by Varroa mites in honey bee colonies and the potential for pyrethrums to help combat this problem.
  The passage also mentions the unintentional effects of commercially produced insecticides in fighting mite infestations in bee colonies.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that commercially produced insecticides are introduced into the hives by beekeepers in an effort to fight mite infestations.
  The passage also suggests that immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened by the introduction of these insecticides.
  Therefore, the passage most strongly suggests that beekeepers' attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides have the unintentional effect of further harming the health of some bees.
  The answer is D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that commercially produced insecticides increase certain mite populations (A) or destroy bees' primary food source (C).
  The passage does not mention any specific beneficial forms of bacteria (B) that the insecticides would kill, so it cannot be concluded that they would have this effect.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the problem of Varroa mites and their effects on bee colonies. 
  Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants that produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity.
  The human mite infestation known as scabies is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.
Thought: 
  The passage states that commercially produced insecticides are introduced into bee colonies by bee keepers in an effort to fight mite infestation.
  The effect of these insecticides on bee colonies is not provided in the passage.
  However, given that the bees are already found to be nutritionally deficient and immunocompromised, it is likely that the introduction of insecticides will further harm the health of some bees.
  Thus, the answer is D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains that beekeepers use commercially produced insecticides to fight mite infestations.
  The passage also states that mite infestation is one factor that can kill bees, and that these mites can also increase susceptibility to secondary infections.
  The passage suggests that the bees of commercial colonies are likely nutritionally deficient because of a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins such as pyrethrums.
Thought:
  Commercially produced insecticides may be harmful to bees, which are already at risk from mite infestation.
  Therefore, the attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides could unintentionally harm the health of some bees.
  The answer is D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to determine which specific harmful effects, if any, commercially produced insecticides have on bees. 
  Therefore, the answer is an interpretation of the information provided in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses honeybee colonies, Varroa mites, natural and synthetic insecticides, and the nutritional deficiencies of the bees.
  The commercial bee colonies are feeding on monocrops.
  Pyrethrums, a natural group of insecticides, have anti-mite activity and are found in plants.
  Commercially produced insecticides are introduced into the hives by bee keepers to fight mite infestation.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that after the introduction of commercially produced insecticides in the hives by beekeepers to fight mite infestation, some of the bees become immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient. 
  Therefore, the introduction of commercially produced insecticides can damage or weaken the health of some bees unintentionally.
  The answer is D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Criticism: 
  There is no discussion in the passage about the insecticides increasing certain mite populations. 
  There is no discussion in the passage about the insecticides killing some beneficial forms of bacteria. 
  There is no discussion in the passage about the insecticides destroying bees' primary food source.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the pathogenic mite Varroa destructor, which infects and kills honey bees.
  Pyrethrums, which are found in certain plants, have anti-mite activity.
  A hypothesis is presented that commercial bee colonies may be deficient in anti-mite toxins, such as pyrethrums, due to a lack of variety in their diets.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that commercial bee colonies may be nutritionally deficient, specifically in anti-mite toxins like pyrethrums.
  Beekeepers may introduce commercially produced insecticides into the hives to fight mite infestation.
  However, these insecticides are harmful to the health of some bees, especially if they are already immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient.
  Therefore, the unintended effect of beekeepers' attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides is that they further harm the health of some bees.
  The answer is D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Criticism: 
  This evaluation of the passage is correct. 
  The passage states that nutritionally deficient or immunocompromised bees may be further weakened by the introduction of commercially produced insecticides into their hives.
  This unintentional effect can occur when beekeepers use insecticides to fight mite infestations.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage mentions that commercially produced insecticides are introduced into bee hives by beekeepers to fight mite infestations.
  The passage states that immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by beekeepers.
Thought:
  Beekeepers use commercially produced insecticides to fight mite infestation.
  Commercially produced insecticides harm the health of nutritionally deficient bees further.
  Therefore, the unintentional effect of beekeepers' attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides is further harm to the health of some bees.
  The answer is D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that beekeepers use commercially produced insecticides to fight mite infestation.
  However, the passage states that the use of these insecticides harms the health of nutritionally deficient bees further, not other unintended consequences such as increasing certain mite populations or killing beneficial forms of bacteria.
  So, the correct answer is D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Bee colonies can be infested by pathogenic mites such as Varroa destructor, which can kill bees.
  Little is known about the natural defenses that keep mite infections under control.
  Pyrethrums are potent insecticides with anti-mite activity that are found in certain plants, which may be deficient in the diets of commercially-raised bee colonies.
  Introductory use of commercially-produced insecticides may have adverse effects on immunocompromised, nutritionally deficient bees.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that bees in mono-crops are deficient in anti-mite toxins, such as pyrethrums.
  Colonies fed on these suboptimal diets may become infested with mites that can directly or indirectly kill bees.
  Beekeepers use commercially produced insecticides, which can further weaken the already vulnerable bees.
  Therefore, the most likely unintended effect of beekeepers' attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides is that it further harms the health of some bees. 
  Thus, the answer is D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Criticism: 
  No critical flaws found in the logic above.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the relationship between honey bees and Varroa mites. Little is known about the natural defenses of bees against mite infections. Pyrethrums produce potent insecticides that have anti-mite activity. Synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. The human mite infestation known as scabies is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream. Bee colonies that are fed mono-crops may be nutritionally deficient in anti-mite toxins. A diet deficient in anti-mite toxins could make bee colonies susceptible to mite infestations that could be fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial, or fungal, and may be due to one or more pathogens. The proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation is better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum-containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the amount already consumed by the bees. 
Thought: 
  Beekeepers use commercially produced insecticides to fight mite infestations.
  Immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees are further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by beekeepers in an effort to fight mite infestation.
  Therefore, the passage most strongly suggests that beekeepers' attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides have the unintentional effect of further harming the health of some bees.
  The answer is D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Criticism: 
  You are correct. The passage explains that immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by beekeepers in an effort to fight mite infestation. Therefore, answer choice D is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the impact of Varroa mites on honey bee colonies and the potential benefits of natural defenses like pyrethrums.
  Bee colonies fed on mono-crops may be nutritionally deficient, in particular, deficient in anti-mite toxins.
  Introducing insecticides into hives may further harm the health of bees.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that beekeepers introduce commercially produced insecticides into hives to control mite infestations.
  The passage also suggests that such insecticides may further harm the health of bees, which may already be weakened due to nutritional deficiencies.
  Therefore, the unintentional effect of beekeepers' attempts to fight mite infestations with commercially produced insecticides is that they further harm the health of some bees.
  The answer is D: They further harm the health of some bees.
Criticism: 
  None.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.
Question: It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that the main reason that the narrator considers Great Expectations to be the best gift he ever received is because
Choices:
  A: reading the book convinced him that he wanted to be a writer.
  B: he'd only ever been given sweets and snacks as gifts in the past.
  C: the gift meant that Sempere held him in high regard.
  D: Sempere was a friend of the book's author.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The narrator's love for reading and books is clear from the passage. 
  Sempere gifted the narrator a copy of Great Expectations by Charles Dickens.
Thought:
  The narrator read Great Expectations nine times over the course of a rainy winter.
  The way the narrator describes the book suggests it had a profound impact on him that went beyond his appreciation of reading and books in general.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the narrator considers Great Expectations to be the best gift he ever received because the book meant something special to him.
  Answer: None of the Above
Criticism:
  Option D is incorrect because it is never stated in the passage that Sempere was a friend of the book's author, only that he knew some authors who frequented his bookshop.
  Option A is not necessarily correct because while the narrator does express a desire to learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done, this does not mean that this is the main reason why he considers Great Expectations to be the best gift he ever received.
  Option B is incorrect because while it is mentioned that the narrator collected coins to buy books, there is no indication that he had never received a book as a gift before.
  Option C is a possible inference because the narrator describes Sempere's bookshop as his "sanctuary" and "refuge", and he has great fondness and respect for Sempere. However, this does not conclusively point to it being the main reason why the narrator considers Great Expectations to be the best gift he ever received.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: The data in table 2 best support which statement about the woodpecker finches that used the unique levering technique to acquire prey?
Choices:
  A: At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
  B: After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether.
  C: After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
  D: None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The context describes an experimental study that investigated whether tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired socially.
  The study took place in the Galapagos Islands with two groups of young woodpecker finches - half were reared with a tool-using model, and half were reared with a non-tool-using model.
  The study found that young woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to watch tool use developed the ability to use tools with similar aptitude and reached distinct developmental stages that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were given the chance to observe tool use. 
  The developmental process in woodpecker finches seems to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components.
  Individual learning does play an important role during the ontogeny of tool use in woodpecker finches.
Thought:
  Table 2 in the context describes the behavior of woodpecker finches who developed a unique levering technique to acquire prey.
  The table shows that all five individuals who developed the technique were successful in their first attempt at acquiring the prey.
  The table also shows that after their initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.
  However, there is no information about whether any of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey or whether any of them ceased using the technique altogether after their first success.
  Therefore, we cannot support statements A, B, or C.
  The best statement supported by the data in Table 2 is that none of them were unsuccessful in their first attempt with the technique.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes an experimental study investigating the acquisition of tool use in woodpecker finches on the Galapagos Islands.
  Table 2 shows the number of tool insertions, number of prey extractions, the sequence of tools used, and the age of the five individuals who developed the unique levering technique.
Thought:
  The question asks about the woodpecker finches that used the unique levering technique to acquire prey.
  From Table 2, we see that all five individuals who developed this technique were successful in their first attempt at acquiring prey using it.
  We do not see any information in the table about how many times they attempted the technique before being successful. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
Criticism:
  It is possible that the woodpecker finches attempted the technique multiple times before being successful, but we do not have that information available in Table 2.
  Therefore, while we cannot say for certain whether they were successful on their first attempt or not, the other choices are not supported by the data in Table 2.

  The passage talks about an experimental study done on woodpecker finches to investigate whether they acquired a certain behavior through social learning. The study found that the behavior was not acquired through social learning, but instead through genetically fixed components. The study also found that non-social, individual learning played an important role in improving the efficiency of this behavior. Five individuals developed a unique levering technique to acquire prey during the study.

Thought:
  The question is asking about the data in table 2 and what it can tell us about the woodpecker finches that used the unique levering technique to acquire prey.
  We need to look at table 2 to see what kind of data it presents.
  Since the question mentions the unique levering technique, we should look at the row in table 2 that corresponds to this technique.
  The row shows that all five individuals that used the levering technique were successful in acquiring prey with this technique.
  The row does not provide any information about the number of attempts the birds made before successfully acquiring prey or whether any of them stopped using the technique altogether.

Criticism:
  My thought process is correct.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses an experimental study on woodpecker finches.
  The study found that woodpecker finches have a genetic predisposition for tool use.
  Five individuals developed a unique levering technique for acquiring prey.
  Table 2 summarizes the data on the success and frequency of use of the levering technique.
Thought:
  Table 2 shows that all five of the birds eventually succeeded in using the levering technique to acquire prey.
  None of the birds were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
  After the first success, some of the birds ceased using the technique, but it is not specified how many.
  It is not stated in the table or in the passage that any of the birds attempted the technique more than five times.
  Therefore, the data in table 2 best support the statement that after the first success at acquiring prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
  The answer is C.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses an experimental study on woodpecker finches.
  Table 2 shows the number of times each bird attempted the unique levering technique and the number of times they were successful in acquiring prey using the technique.
Thought: 
  The question asks which statement is best supported by the data in table 2. 
  Looking at table 2, there are several birds that attempted the technique more than five times before being successful. 
  Additionally, there are some birds that attempted the technique but were not successful in acquiring prey. 
  None of the birds in table 2 ceased using the technique altogether. 
  Therefore, statement A is a possible answer.
  However, statement C is more accurate as none of the birds attempted the technique more than five times after the first success at acquiring prey.
Criticism: 
  There are no data in table 2 to support statement B.
  Statement A is partially supported by the data, but it is not the best answer.
  Statement D is incorrect as some of the birds were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes an experimental study on woodpecker finches' use of tools.
  The finches were split into groups, with some raised with a tool-using model and others raised with a non-tool-using model.
  The study found that the ability to use tools developed in the finches regardless of whether they had observed tool use or not.
  The study also found that the development of tool use in woodpecker finches is strongly dependent on genetically fixed components.
  The passage describes observations of woodpecker finches using a unique levering technique to acquire prey.
  The passage states that five birds developed this method during the study.
  After initial success with the technique, these birds significantly increased its use.
Thought: 
  Table 2 probably describes the success rates of the unique levering technique used by the woodpecker finches.
  The passage states that "five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild, most likely because our artificial crevices differed from natural crevices and tree holes."
  It then states that "After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method."
  Therefore, Table 2 may show an increase in success rates for the unique levering technique over time.
  Statements A, B, C, and D all make claims about the finches' attempts to use the technique, but there is no information in the passage to support any of them.
  Therefore, none of the statements are the best-supported by Table 2.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses an experimental study conducted on woodpecker finches.
  The study split each brood of chicks into two groups: one group was exposed to a tool-using model, and the other group was exposed to a non-tool-using model.
  The study found that young woodpecker finches that were not given the opportunity to observe tool use still developed the ability to use tools at a similar pace as those who did observe tool use.
  The study also found that individual learning plays an important role in improving the efficiency of tool use in woodpecker finches.
  The passage mentions that some woodpecker finches developed a unique levering technique to acquire prey.
  Table 2 provides data on the number of times each bird attempted and successfully used the levering technique.
Thought: 
  The question asks about the data in table 2, which provides information about the woodpecker finches that used the unique levering technique to acquire prey.
  Choice A suggests that at least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey, but this is not specifically stated in the passage or table 2.
  Choice B suggests that after the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether, but there is no evidence to support this in the passage or table 2.
  Choice C suggests that after the first success at acquiring prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times. This seems plausible based on the data in table 2, which shows that each bird attempted the technique between 1 and 5 times before successfully acquiring prey, but it is not explicitly stated.
  Choice D suggests that none of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique, but this is contradicted by the data in table 2, which shows that some birds were successful in their first attempt.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: After the first success at acquiring prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The text talks about an experimental study investigating twig tool use in woodpecker finches.
  The study split whole broods from the Galapagos Islands into two groups; one group was raised with a tool-using model and the other with a non-tool-using model.
  The study found that young woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to watch tool use developed the ability to use tools with similar aptitude as their siblings that were given the opportunity to observe tool use in adult woodpecker finches.
  The developmental process of tool use in woodpecker finches seems to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components.
  During the study, five individuals developed a unique levering technique to acquire prey that differed from the tool use performed by birds in the wild. 
  After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.
Thought: 
  Table 2 probably presents data about the use of the unique levering technique to acquire prey by woodpecker finches during the study.
  Option A suggests that at least one of the birds attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
  Option B suggests that after the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether.
  Option C suggests that after the first success at acquiring prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
  Option D suggests that none of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
  Based on the information given in the text, the unique levering technique was successful for the woodpecker finches that developed it.
  It is unlikely that none of them were initially successful with the technique.
  It is also unlikely that they stopped using the technique altogether after the first success.
  Therefore, option A seems to be the most likely.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the results of an experimental study on tool use in woodpecker finches.
  The study found that the development of tool use is strongly dependent on genetically fixed components.
  However, non-social, individual learning also plays an important role in improving the efficiency of the behavior.
  The study found that some woodpecker finches developed a unique levering technique to acquire prey using tools that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild.
  Table 2 presents data on the number of successful and unsuccessful attempts by each bird using the unique levering technique.
Thought: 
  The question refers to unique levering technique to acquire prey using tools that were developed by some woodpecker finches.
  According to the passage, non-social, individual learning plays an important role in improving the efficiency of the behavior.
  Table 2 presents data on the number of successful and unsuccessful attempts by each bird using the unique levering technique.
  Therefore, the data in Table 2 will tell us how many attempts the woodpecker finches made before acquiring prey using the unique levering technique.
  The correct answer should be the statement that best describes the data in Table 2.
  A: There is no information on whether at least one of them attempted the technique five times before successful acquisition of prey.
  B: There is no information on whether any of them ceased using the technique altogether after their first success.
  C: The data in Table 2 does not support the statement that none of them attempted the technique more than five times after their first success.
  D: The data in Table 2 indicates that all of the woodpecker finches were eventually successful in their use of the unique levering technique to acquire prey using tools. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is 'None of the above'.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes a study on woodpecker finches and their use of tools, which provide an important part of their diet. 
  The study involved splitting whole broods of the birds into two groups: half with a tool-using model and half without. 
  The study found that young woodpecker finches could develop the ability to use tools without social learning, but rather through a strong genetic predisposition. 
  However, the study also found that individual learning played a role in improving the efficiency of this behavior. 
  Table 2 likely contains data that pertains to this individual learning process.
Thought: 
  The question is asking what statement is best supported by the data in table 2, which presumably describes the behavior of woodpecker finches using the unique levering technique to acquire prey.
  Based on the passage, we know that the woodpecker finches are able to develop this ability through individual learning, and that the birds in the study experienced initial success with the technique, then increased their use of it. 
  It does not mention anything about ceasing to use the technique altogether after the first success or attempting it more than five times before acquiring prey.
  Therefore, the best statement supported by the data in table 2 is that at least one of the woodpecker finches attempted the unique levering technique more than once before successfully acquiring prey.
  The correct answer is A: At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
Criticism: 
  The passage suggests that individual learning plays a role in improving the efficiency of the behavior, but does not provide specific information about how many times the birds attempted the technique before success. 
  Therefore, the answer may not be conclusive.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

Knowledge: Miss Grace Spivey is a new schoolteacher who has arrived in Threestep, Georgia. She is a woman of the world, having traveled extensively and studied in prestigious universities. She has a pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard that is actually a wrinkled map of the world. Ralphord is a student of Miss Spivey and asked her what she studied at Barnard College.
Thought: Miss Spivey is a knowledgeable woman, and her travels are a source of fascination for the children in the class. It is clear that Ralphord doesn't possess the same wealth of knowledge as Miss Spivey does, but his question is innocent and curious.
Criticism: There is no indication that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge. In fact, she seems to enjoy sharing her experiences and knowledge with her students. While the dynamic between Miss Spivey and the children in the class is friendly and curious, there is no evidence to suggest that Miss Spivey is doting or indulgent. Ralphord's question does not introduce him as a precocious student or Miss Spivey as a dismissive teacher. The children's questions may amuse Miss Spivey, but it is not the main purpose of Ralphord's question.
Action: Answer("B") - The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord serves mainly to establish a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor.
Response 7:
Knowledge:

The best choice is B: establish a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  This excerpt is about Miss Spivey, a new schoolteacher who has arrived in Threestep, Georgia. 
  Ralphord is a character who asks what Miss Spivey studied at Barnard College. 
Thought: 
  Ralphord asks Miss Spivey a question, but he mistakenly calls Barnard College "Barnyard College."
  Miss Spivey corrects him, then explains that Barnard is the sister school of Columbia University.
  This interaction does not suggest that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge.
  It does not establish a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor.
  It does not introduce Ralphord as a precocious young student and Miss Spivey as a dismissive and disinterested teacher.
  It does not demonstrate that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions.
  The interaction seems like a typical question-and-answer exchange between a student and a teacher.
  Therefore, none of the choices seem like the correct answer.
  However, choice B is the closest to the correct answer, as it mentions a "friendly dynamic" between the children and Miss Spivey, albeit an inaccurate description.
Criticism: 
  The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord does not specifically establish a "friendly dynamic" between them or between the children and Miss Spivey.
  Therefore, choice B is incorrect.
  As there is no clear answer among the given choices, I will select the most likely answer, which is C. Although not entirely accurate, it could be argued that the interaction introduces Ralphord as a precocious young student who asks a question and Miss Spivey as dismissive and disinterested because she avoids his gaze when he asks the question.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:

- There is no indication of a negative or dismissive attitude from Miss Spivey towards Ralphord or the question he asks.
- The interaction serves to show how Miss Spivey shares her experiences and achievements with her new students.
- Therefore, the answer is not C.
- The interaction also doesn't suggest that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge as it is a valid question.
- The interaction does not establish a friendly dynamic between Miss Spivey and the schoolchildren overall as it only focuses on the interaction between her and Ralphord.
- The interaction does not demonstrate that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions as Ralphord's question appears genuine and unamusing.
- Therefore, the answer is B.
Criticism:
- The answer could be interpreted as subjective as it relies on a reader's interpretation of the dynamic between Miss Spivey and the students.
- However, there is no indication of a negative or dismissive attitude from Miss Spivey towards Ralphord or the question he asks.
- Therefore, the answer is still valid.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis," says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. "Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth," Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. "We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment," Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 "standard of care treatment." That's going to take five years and $\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.
Question: Information in Passage 2 best supports which conclusion about the mice in the experiment described in Passage 1?
Choices:
  A: Exposure to teixobactin made them less susceptible to subsequent upper respiratory tract infections.
  B: Gram-positive bacteria enhanced the effectiveness of teixobactin against their upper respiratory tract infections.
  C: Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
  D: Teixobactin attacked the proteins of the bacteria that caused their upper respiratory tract infections.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes an experiment where mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections were treated with teixobactin and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
  Passage 2 also discusses the use of soil bacteria to develop new antibiotics, including teixobactin.
  Teixobactin was effective in killing Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, but was too big to kill Gram-negative bacteria.
Thought:
  Passage 2 supports the conclusion that the bacteria that caused the mice's upper respiratory tract infections were likely Gram-positive bacteria.
  Teixobactin was effective against Gram-positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, so it could be effective against the bacteria that infected the mice.
  Therefore, the mice's upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by Gram-negative bacteria.
  None of the passages mention anything about the mice being less susceptible to subsequent upper respiratory tract infections.
  Additionally, the passages state that teixobactin attacks the lipid molecules of bacterial cell walls, not the proteins.
  Therefore, the best answer choice is: C: Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by Gram-negative bacteria.
Criticism:
  There is no direct evidence in either passage that explicitly supports answer choice C.
  However, the fact that teixobactin worked against Gram-positive bacteria and not Gram-negative bacteria suggests that the mice's upper respiratory tract infections were likely caused by Gram-positive bacteria.
  Therefore, although there is no direct evidence to support answer choice C, it is still the best answer choice available.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes an experiment on mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections, in which they were treated with teixobactin and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
  Passage 2 describes research on cultivating more types of soil bacteria to find new natural antibiotics, and mentions the discovery of teixobactin from a bacterium that killed Gram-positive bacteria.
Thought: 
  Passage 1 describes an experiment on mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections, in which they were treated with teixobactin and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
  Passage 2 mentions that teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, and doesn't mention anything about Gram-negative bacteria.
  Therefore, it is likely that the mice's upper respiratory tract infections were caused by Gram-positive bacteria and not Gram-negative bacteria.
  The best conclusion supported by Passage 2 is C: Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
Criticism: 
  There are no major flaws in this logic or reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a new antibiotic named teixobactin that has shown promise in killing various disease-causing bacteria and could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it. 
  The antibiotic is effective by breaking down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cells create organically, which is different from many other antibiotics that target the bacteria's proteins.
  Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
  Passage 2 also discusses the process of isolating and growing individual soil bacteria to find new natural antibiotics such as teixobactin.
Thought:
  The experiment described in Passage 1 tested the effectiveness of teixobactin on mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. 
  The drug knocked out the infections in the mice with no noticeable toxic effects. 
  No information in Passage 2 suggests that the effectiveness of teixobactin was enhanced by Gram-positive bacteria, nor does it mention whether the mice were exposed to pathogens other than those targeted by teixobactin. 
  Therefore, it can be concluded that the upper respiratory tract infections in the mice were likely caused by the bacteria that teixobactin was effective against, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which are Gram-positive bacteria. 
  The answer is B: Gram-positive bacteria likely caused the upper respiratory tract infections in the mice that were treated with teixobactin.
Criticism: 
  The information in Passage 2 does not explicitly state that the upper respiratory tract infections in the mice were caused by Gram-positive bacteria, so it is possible that the answer is None of the Above. 
  However, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that the upper respiratory tract infections were caused by the bacteria targeted by teixobactin, which are Gram-positive bacteria.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes an animal test of teixobactin to treat bacterial infections.
  The test was focused on upper respiratory tract infections and involved mice infected with bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
  Teixobactin was effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
  The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically.
  Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to produce different structures.
  Passage 2 mentions that teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria and cured experimental infection in mice. 
Thought:
  In Passage 2, it is mentioned that teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in laboratory tests and cured experimental infection in mice.
  Passage 1 describes an animal test of teixobactin to treat bacterial infections in mice, including infections caused by S. aureus and S. pneumoniae.
  Therefore, it can be concluded that the infections tested in Passage 1 were caused by Gram-positive bacteria, which are susceptible to teixobactin.
  The answer is C: Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
Criticism: 
  None of the answer choices are completely accurate, but C is the closest match.
  Passage 2 does not provide information on the susceptibility of the mice to subsequent infections, so A is incorrect.
  B is unsupported by the passages and does not make sense.
  D is incorrect since teixobactin attacks bacterial cell walls, not proteins.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a new antibiotic called teixobactin, which has been shown to be effective at killing disease-causing bacteria, including those that have developed immunity to other drugs.
  Passage 2 discusses a recent study in which researchers were able to isolate and grow individual soil bacteria, including types that can't normally be grown in the laboratory, in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals.
  The study led to the discovery of teixobactin, which was effective at killing Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, and also killed the tuberculosis bacterium.
Thought: 
  Passage 2 states that teixobactin is effective at killing Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, and was also effective at killing the bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections in the mice, which suggests that their infections were likely caused by Gram-positive bacteria.
  Passage 2 does not mention whether exposure to teixobactin made the mice less susceptible to subsequent upper respiratory tract infections, whether Gram-positive bacteria enhanced the effectiveness of teixobactin against their upper respiratory tract infections, or whether teixobactin attacked the proteins of the bacteria that caused their upper respiratory tract infections.
  Therefore, the best conclusion is that their upper respiratory tract infections were likely caused by Gram-positive bacteria.
  The answer is C: Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes a study in which teixobactin was tested on mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections.
  Passage 1 explains that teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria, including those that have developed immunity to other drugs.
  Passage 1 states that teixobactin attacks the lipid molecules that the bacterial cell creates organically, rather than the proteins of the bacteria.
  Passage 2 describes the study in Passage 1 as an effort to grow new types of bacteria from soil in order to find new natural antibiotics.
  Passage 2 notes that teixobactin is effective against Gram-positive bacteria but not against Gram-negative bacteria and that "Gram-negative opportunists" are too difficult to kill because of their complex cell walls.
Thought:
  The experiment described in Passage 1 tested the effectiveness of teixobactin on mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections.
  The study found that teixobactin was effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria, including those that have developed immunity to other drugs.
  Therefore, it is likely that teixobactin was effective at treating the mice's upper respiratory tract infections, which were presumably caused by bacteria.
  The mice's infections were likely caused by Gram-positive bacteria because teixobactin is effective against this type of bacteria.
  Thus, information in Passage 2 best supports the conclusion that the mice's upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by Gram-negative bacteria.
  The answer is C: Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by Gram-negative bacteria.
Criticism:
  There is no information in either passage that definitively answers the question of whether the mice's infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria or not.
  It is possible that the mice were infected with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but teixobactin was only effective against the Gram-positive bacteria.
  Therefore, while C may be the most likely answer based on the information given, it is not definitively supported.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes an experiment where teixobactin was tested on mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections.
  The drug teixobactin was found to be effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
  Teixobactin is effective because it targets the bacteria's lipid molecules that the cells create organically.
  Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins.
Thought: 
  The passage 1 doesn't provide evidence to support option A that exposure to teixobactin made the mice less susceptible to subsequent upper respiratory tract infections.
  Passage 1 mentions that teixobactin is effective at killing gram-positive bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections like Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
  Passage 2 suggests that teixobactin doesn't kill Gram-negative opportunists, so the upper respiratory tract infections caused by mice might be caused by gram-positive bacteria.
  Therefore, option C is the best conclusion supported by information in Passage 2.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in Passage 1 to support options A, B and D.
  Although teixobactin is effective against gram-positive bacteria, there is no indication in Passage 1 that gram-positive bacteria enhance the effectiveness of teixobactin. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a study in which teixobactin, a new antibiotic, was effective in killing a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria, even those that have developed immunity to other drugs.
  Passage 2 discusses the discovery of teixobactin and how it was isolated and grown from individual soil bacteria, including uncultured soil bacteria. It also mentions that teixobactin is not effective against Gram-negative opportunists.
Thought: 
  Passage 1 states that teixobactin was effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria.
  It also indicates that the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
  In the mice experiment mentioned in the passage, the drug was able to cure upper respiratory tract infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
  Passage 2 mentions that teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, but it was not effective against Gram-negative opportunists.
  Therefore, it is likely that the upper respiratory tract infections in the mice experiment were caused by Gram-positive bacteria.
  Choice C is the most likely answer.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide direct evidence that the mice had upper respiratory tract infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. It is possible that other types of bacteria caused the infections.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes teixobactin, a new antibiotic, that was found to be effective against a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria, even those that have developed immunity to other drugs.
  Teixobactin was effective against bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in mice.
  Teixobactin breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules.
  Passage 2 talks about the importance of being able to isolate and grow individual soil bacteria in soil and how this methodology has opened up a gateway to cultivating bacteria that have never been grown before.
  Teixobactin is the first new antibiotic that has been found using this method.
Thought: 
  Passage 1 describes how teixobactin was effective at killing bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections in mice.
  Passage 2 talks about a new method of cultivating potentially antibiotic-producing bacteria that have never been grown before, and teixobactin is the first new antibiotic found by using this method.
  Therefore, it can be concluded that the mice in the experiment described in Passage 1 were likely infected with bacteria that have been newly cultivated by using the method described in Passage 2.
  Moreover, the effectiveness of teixobactin could be related to the fact that it breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules, which supports the information provided in Passage 1. 
  There is no evidence to support options A, B, and D.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes the success of teixobactin in killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria in animal tests, including those that have developed immunity to other drugs. It targets bacterial cells walls by attacking lipid molecules that bacteria create organically. The drug was effective against bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections, such as S. aureus and S. pneumoniae.
  Passage 2 describes a recent study in which researchers were able to isolate and grow individual soil bacteria in soil itself, and transfer the bacteria to the lab for cultivation to obtain new natural antibiotics.
Thought: 
  In the experiment described in Passage 1, mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
  In Passage 2, researchers were able to isolate and grow individual soil bacteria in soil itself to obtain new natural antibiotics.
  The two passages are not related, and nothing in Passage 2 explains or directly relates to the experiment described in Passage 1.
  Therefore, there is not enough information to make any conclusion about the mice in the experiment described in Passage 1 based on the information provided in Passage 2.
  The answer is "None of the above".

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: According to the passage, which statement best explains why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close?
Choices:
  A: The second trigger produces an electrical charge that reverses the charge produced by the first trigger.
  B: The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.
  C: The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open.
  D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
  A: The second trigger does not produce an electrical charge that reverses the charge produced by the first trigger, according to the passage.
  B: The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger, which does not fully explain why a second trigger is required.
  C: The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open, but it doesn't explain why a second trigger is required.
  D: The passage mentions that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched doesn't reach the level required for the trap to close.
Thought: 
  A single trigger hair being touched only produces a small amount of calcium ion concentration.
  The second trigger hair being touched increases the calcium ion concentration.
  The calcium ion concentration must be above a certain threshold for the trap to close.
  Therefore, the second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger in order to surpass the threshold.
  Option D best explains why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap closes its trap only when it knows that its prey is large enough to be worth the energy expense.
  The flytrap has large black hairs on its lobes, which allow it to sense its prey and act as triggers to shut the trap.
  A small bug will only touch one hair and will not spring the trap shut, whereas a large bug will likely touch two hairs within twenty seconds, and that signal springs the trap into action.
  Scientists have found that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
Thought: 
  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time because this allows for a surge of calcium ions to be created in the trap.
  A single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not result in a high enough concentration of calcium to close the trap.
  The second trigger hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over a threshold and prompt the trap to close. 
  Therefore, the second trigger hair stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger, resulting in a higher concentration of calcium and the closure of the trap.
  The answer is B: The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.
Criticism: 
  Your thoughts are correct based on the information presented in the passage. 
  None of the other options explain the mechanism for why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Venus flytraps require a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close. 
  If only one hair is touched, the trap will not spring shut.
  Touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
  A single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach the level of calcium concentration required to spring the trap.
Thought:
  According to the passage, the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
  Scientists propose that the reason for this is that a second trigger stabilizes or supplements the concentration of calcium ions released by the first trigger.
  Therefore, B and D are possible answers.
  However, the passage clearly states that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close and that a single trigger hair does not produce this level of calcium concentration.
  The second trigger is needed to push the calcium concentration over this threshold to spring the trap. 
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D: the second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Venus flytraps close their traps when they are sure that the insect crawling across their leaves is large enough to be worth their time, which requires a lot of energy.
- The flytrap's lobes have black hair that helps it feel its prey, and they act as triggers to spring the trap closed.
- If a large enough bug touches two hairs within about twenty seconds, the signal springs the trap into action.
Thought:
- The first trigger hair produces an electrical charge, which induces calcium channels to open and increase the concentration of calcium ions in the trap.
- It requires a relatively high concentration of calcium ions for the trap to close, which means that a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold.
- The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger, which stabilizes the surge of calcium ions and allows the trap to close.
- Without the second trigger, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Thus, the correct answer is D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
  A: Option A talks about an electrical charge produced by the second trigger reversing the charge produced by the first trigger, but there is no such mention in the passage.
  B: Option B talks about the second trigger stabilizing the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger, but there is no such mention in the passage.
  C: Option C talks about the second trigger prompting the calcium channels to open which can increase calcium ions, but it does not explain why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger to be touched.
  D: Option D talks about the second trigger providing a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger, and the passage mentions that a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over a threshold in order to spring the trap. 
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how the Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close. 
  A single trigger hair being touched does not reach this level, so a second hair is needed to push the calcium concentration over the threshold to close the trap.
  Therefore, Option D, "The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger," best explains why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of an electrical charge reversing or stabilizing the surge of calcium ions in the passage, so options A and B are not correct.
  Option C talks about prompting calcium channels to open which can increase calcium ions, but this does not fully explain why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger to be touched, so it is not the best answer.
  Therefore, Option D is the best answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap requires two trigger hairs to be touched within a certain time frame for the trap to close.
  A: The second trigger does not produce an electrical charge that reverses the first one.
  B: The second trigger could stabilize the surge of calcium ions from the first trigger.
  C: The opening of the calcium channels is caused by the first trigger.
  D: The second trigger is necessary to add to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger such that the trap can close.
Thought:
  The Venus flytrap requires two trigger hairs to be touched within a certain time frame for the trap to close.
  The first trigger causes an action potential for opening the calcium channels.
  The opening of the channels causes a surge in calcium concentrations.
  A second trigger is necessary to push the concentration over a threshold for the trap to close.
  Therefore, Answer("D") is the correct statement explaining why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a certain time frame.
Criticism:
  The thought process seems to be correct according to the information available in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The Venus flytrap needs to be sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time before closing its trap.
- The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the trap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap.
- If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
- Touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
- The Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
Thought:
- The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
- The concentration of calcium in the trap needs to be pushed over a threshold in order for the trap to close.
- The first trigger hair produces an electric action potential, but this alone doesn't raise the calcium concentration in the trap enough to close it.
- The second trigger hair needs to be stimulated in order to push the calcium concentration over the threshold.
- Therefore, the second trigger hair provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
- The answer is D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
Criticism:
- There is no information in the passage to support option A. The passage does not mention anything about one trigger hair reversing the charge produced by another trigger hair.
- Option B is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention anything about a surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger or the second trigger stabilizing it.
- Option C is not the best explanation. Although the second trigger does prompt the calcium channels to open, this doesn't explain why a second trigger is necessary for the trap to close.
- The explanation in option D is consistent with the information in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Venus flytraps only want to spring closed when the prey is large enough to be worth its time.
  Large black hairs on the lobes allow the Venus flytraps to feel and sense their prey.
  The Venus flytrap will not shut if just one hair is touched.
  If the prey touches two hairs within about twenty seconds, the trap will spring into action.
  Scientists have been investigating how the flytrap encodes and stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched.

The best answer is B: The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap needs to ensure that its prey is large enough before closing its trap.
  The Venus flytrap can detect a potential meal with its trigger hairs.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
Thought: 
  Touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
  The final concentration of calcium after the second trigger needs to be high enough to close the trap.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over a threshold and spring the trap.
  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order to provide a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
  The answer is D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct based on the information provided in the passage.
  There is no explicit statement in the passage to suggest that the second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger or that the second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open. 
  Therefore, options B and C can be eliminated. 
  Option A is not mentioned in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap needs a second trigger hair to be touched within a certain amount of time to close its trap and catch its prey.
  Scientists have been puzzled as to how the Venus flytrap stores and encodes the information from the first trigger hair.
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that the Venus flytrap stores the information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  Touching a trigger hair causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
Thought: 
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched to push the calcium concentration over the threshold to close its trap.
  This is because a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach the concentration needed to trigger the trap to close.
  Therefore, the second trigger hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold to spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase triggered by touching the second hair pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
  Therefore, the second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger and provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
  The answer is D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention that the second trigger provides a reversal of the electrical charge.
  Although the second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open, this alone does not fully explain why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger to close.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these "low-threshold" nerves "C-tactile," or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their "exquisite sensitivity" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations
Question: Based on the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected which condition to result from the blocking of fast fibers?
Choices:
  A: The rate at which other nerve fibers fired would increase.
  B: The test subject would perceive gentle stimuli as painful.
  C: The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
  D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  In the early 1990s, textbooks believed that impulses for pressure and vibration were transmitted via fast-conducting nerve fibers and that slow-conducting fibers only responded to stimuli of pain and temperature. The blocking of fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether. Blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
Thought: 
  According to the passage, the blocking of fast fibers would interfere with the sensation of pressure. Therefore, the body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
  The answer is C: The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct according to the information provided in the passage. 
  However, the question is somewhat misleading as it uses negative phrasing. 
  The phrase "which condition to result" might make you think about adverse side effects. 
  Instead, it would be clearer to ask, "What would be the consequence of blocking fast fibers?" or "How would the body compensate for the blocking of fast fibers?"
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Textbook authors in the early 1990s believed that myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers were responsible for sensations of pressure and vibration, as well as location information. 
  They also believed that slow-conducting nerves only responded to pain and temperature.
  Experiments blocking nerve fibers suggested that fast fibers were responsible for the sensation of pressure while blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
Thought:
  Textbook authors in the early 1990s believed that myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers were responsible for sensations of pressure.
  Blocking fast fibers would have caused the sensation of pressure to diminish or disappear.
  Therefore, the textbook authors would most likely have expected the ability to perceive pressure to be impaired.
  The answer is D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.
Criticism:
  There is not enough information in the passage to directly support the answer choice.
  However, the passage does suggest that fast fibers were believed to be responsible for the sensation of pressure, not vibrations, so answer choice D is the most likely.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  In the early 1990s, textbooks stated that humans had slow-conducting nerves that only responded to pain and temperature, whereas pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along fast-signaling nerve fibers. Blocking of fast fibers was expected to cause the elimination of the sensation of pressure altogether. Blocking of slow fibers, on the other hand, was believed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
Thought: 
  Textbook authors in the early 1990s believed that pressure and vibration were sensed only by fast-signaling nerve fibers. Therefore, blocking of fast fibers would most likely result in the impairment of vibration perception. None of the answer choices mention this option. The passage does not provide any information about choices A, B, or D. On the contrary, the passage mentions that blocking fast fibers was expected to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, whereas blocking of slow fibers was believed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock. Therefore, choice C, which states that the body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure, is the most likely option.
Criticism: 
  The answer could potentially be wrong if there were other relevant information in the passage that contradicts the selection of choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses experiments blocking nerve fibers and the resulting effects. 
  The experiments used local anesthetic lidocaine or clamping to prevent fibers from firing. 
  The experiments showed that preventing fast fibers from firing seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, while blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
Thought: 
  Blocking fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.
  Textbook authors in the early 1990s believed that nerves only responded to two types of stimuli: pain and temperature.
  Sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also gave information about location.
  Therefore, textbook authors in the early 1990s would have most likely expected the ability to perceive pressure to be impaired by blocking fast fibers.
  The answer is C: The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
Criticism: 
  Based on the passage, it is not stated or implied that blocking fast fibers would lead to compensation by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
  It is only stated that blocking slow fibers would reduce sensitivity to warmth or small painful shock, while blocking fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.
  Therefore, the answer is not C. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how early 1990s textbooks explained how nerves respond to different stimuli.
  They believed fast-signaling myelinated nerve fibers only responded to certain types of stimuli.
  Experiments blocking these fibers supported this theory.
Thought:
  The question asks what textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely expect to result from the blocking of fast fibers.
  According to the passage, textbook authors would likely expect the body to compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that textbook authors in the early 1990s would expect that blocking fast fibers would lead to an increase in firing rate in other nerve fibers (A).
  Similarly, there is no evidence to suggest that blocking fast fibers would cause test subjects to perceive gentle stimuli as painful (B).
  The passage suggests that slow fibers are already responsible for sensation of pressure, so blocking fast fibers would not cause the body to suddenly start using them to sense pressure (C) - rather, it would just leave slow fibers as the only option for sensing pressure.
  The passage also does not mention anything about the ability to perceive vibrations (D).
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Textbooks in the early 1990s acknowledged the presence of slow-conducting nerves.
  These nerves were believed at the time to only respond to two types of stimuli: pain and temperature.
  Sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along fast-conducting fibers.
  Experiments blocking nerve fibers confirmed this notion.
  Preventing fast fibers from firing seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, while blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
Thought:
  Blocking fast fibers is expected to result in the loss of the sensation of pressure since pressure sensations are believed to travel only along fast-conducting fibers.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, or D, since they do not describe how blocking fast fibers affects sensations of pressure.
  C is the only answer that correctly describes the effect of blocking fast fibers on the body's ability to sense pressure since it suggests that the slow fibers are being used to sense pressure in place of the fast fibers.
Criticism:
  The answer is not explicitly stated in the passage.
  The passage only suggests that blocking fast fibers appears to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but it does not say that the slow fibers compensate for this loss.
  Additionally, the question asks what textbook authors in the early 1990s would have expected, but the passage does not provide direct evidence of what they would have believed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Textbook authors in the early 1990s believed that slow-conducting nerves only responded to pain and temperature.
  Fast-signaling nerve fibers gave information about location, including sensations of pressure and vibration.
  Blocking fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.
  Blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
Thought: 
  Textbook authors in the early 1990s did not extensively discuss the consequences of blocking fast fibers, except that the sensation of pressure would be eliminated altogether.
  Therefore, it is difficult to determine which condition they would likely have expected from blocking fast fibers.
  None of the answer choices can be confidently selected as the best answer.
  "None of the above" is not an option.
  However, based on the given information, it is likely that blocking fast fibers would result in the impairment of the ability to perceive vibrations.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to confidently select one of the answer choices as the best answer.
  The information given on the consequences of blocking fast fibers is limited and does not provide a clear indication of which answer choice is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Textbook authors in the early 1990s believed that slow nerves responded only to pain and temperature stimuli; pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers.
  Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported the notion of fast fibers responding to touch.
Thought: 
  Experiments blocking nerve fibers have been conducted to understand the response of different types of nerves. 
  According to the passage, blocking fast fibers suggested that the sensation of pressure was eliminated, while blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.
  Therefore, the textbook authors in early 1990s would most likely have expected the reduction in a test subject's sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock when fast nerve fibers are blocked, while still be able to perceive gentle stimuli as painless.
  The answer is D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.
Criticism: 
  While it is true that blocking fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, the question asks about the condition resulting from blocking fast fibers.
  The passage doesn't explicitly mention the effect of blocking fast fibers on the ability to perceive vibrations.
  Therefore, a better answer could be A: The rate at which other nerve fibers fired would increase, since the passage mentions that fast fibers responded only to touch stimuli and were important for providing information about location.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Textbook authors in the early 1990s believed that sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers.
  Blocking nerve fibers prevented fast fibers from firing but blocking slow fibers did not eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.
Thought: 
  If fast fibers are blocked, the expected result based on the paragraph is that the ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.
  Choice D matches this expectation.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Authors of textbooks in the early 1990s believed that sensations of pressure and vibration were conveyed only by myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers that also provided location information.
  Experiments blocking fast and slow nerve fibers were conducted to understand their functions.
Thought:
  Experiments showed that preventing fast fibers from firing eliminated the sensation of pressure altogether, while blocking slow fibers only reduced sensitivity to warmth or small painful shock.
  Therefore, if fast fibers were blocked, the expected outcome would be an impairment in the ability to perceive pressure, not an increase in firing rate or perception of pain, vibration, or a switch to using slow fibers.
  Hence, the correct answer is D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.
Criticism: None.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect
Question: Data in the table best support the conclusion thatthe majority of the mass in the asteroid belt as awhole is in asteroids that are
Choices:
  A: primitive.
  B: basaltic.
  C: high in reflectivity.
  D: low in reflectivity.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the distribution and survival of different types of asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  A: Primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites.
  B: Basaltic asteroids are not mentioned in the passage.
  C: High reflectivity may be an indication of metal content in asteroids.
  D: Low reflectivity may be an indication of rocky or carbonaceous material in asteroids.
Thought: 
  The mass of the asteroid belt is divided between iron fragments and rocky fragments.
  Iron fragments are stronger, survive better, and thus contribute significantly to the mass of asteroids in the belt.
  The majority of the mass in the asteroid belt is in asteroids that are iron-rich, high in reflectivity and hence of metallic composition.
  Therefore, the table data best supports the conclusion that the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt as a whole is in asteroids that are high in reflectivity.
  Therefore, the answer is C: high in reflectivity.
Criticism: 
  There is no direct support in the passage for the conclusion that high reflectivity indicates metal content. It is not clear whether high reflectivity in asteroids also could indicate other types of material, such as ice or minerals. 
  Additionally, while the text suggests the possibility that the asteroid belt is dominated by metallic asteroids, it does not provide enough direct information to conclude that the majority of the mass is in asteroids with high reflectivity.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses the composition of the asteroid belt.
  The table mentioned in the question is not provided.
Thought:
  The question refers to a table that is not provided, so it is difficult to draw a conclusion.
  However, the article suggests that the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt and most of them survived.
  On the other hand, it is suggested that the differentiated asteroids were relatively rare to begin with and few have survived.
  Therefore, if the table shows the composition of the asteroids in the belt, it is more likely to be dominated by primitive asteroids.
  So, the answer is A: primitive.
Criticism:
  Since the table is not provided, it is not possible to have a definite answer.
  Although the article suggests that primitive asteroids may be more common, it does not rule out the possibility of other types of asteroids.
Action: Answer("A") as the most likely answer based on the information provided.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about different types of asteroids within the asteroid belt.
  A: Primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, and are not necessarily the most common type in the asteroid belt.
  B: Basaltic asteroids are mentioned in the passage but there is no indication that they are more numerous than other types.
  C: High reflectivity is mentioned in passing, but it is not clear whether this is a characteristic of the majority of asteroids in the belt.
  D: The passage mentions that iron fragments have survived better than rocky fragments, which may suggest that a significant proportion of the mass in the asteroid belt is composed of low reflectivity rocky material.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that some asteroids have partially or wholly melted, but these would not match the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies.
  The rarity of mantle rocks in the meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt is a long-standing puzzle.
  Iron fragments may survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart, but this does not necessarily indicate that the majority of asteroids are iron-rich.
  Primitive asteroids are mentioned, but there is no indication that they are the most common type in the asteroid belt.
  Therefore, there is not enough information in the passage to confidently select any of the given choices.
  The answer is none of the above.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage does not provide enough information to confidently select a choice.
  However, it is possible to make an inference that low reflectivity rocky material, which may be more easily disrupted and lost in space, is less common than high reflectivity material or more robust iron fragments in the asteroid belt. 
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D: low in reflectivity.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  From the passage, we know that:
  - The asteroid belt contains both primitive and differentiated asteroids.
  - Iron fragments of differentiated asteroids may have survived better than rocky fragments because they are stronger and were located in the core, whereas rocky fragments were on the surface.
  - Primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites and are no stronger than mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
  - Differentiated bodies were relatively rare to begin with, and perhaps none of them have survived.
Thought:
  The table does not provide information on the type of asteroids in the asteroid belt nor does it provide information on their strength.
  The table shows the distribution of asteroid compositions based on their reflectance. 
  However, we cannot make a conclusion about the majority of mass in the asteroid belt from this information alone.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices can be confidently selected.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the asteroid belt and the types of asteroids found within it.
  The passage mentions "primitive asteroids" and "differentiated asteroids".
  The passage notes that differentiated asteroids have an iron core and rocky mantle.
  The passage explains that iron fragments may survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart.
  The passage indicates that Vesta is a differentiated asteroid and may be one of the few remaining intact differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
Thought:
  The passage does not give specific information about the mass of asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  Based on what the passage does discuss, it seems that there is a mixture of primitive and differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
  While the passage does mention the reflectivity of asteroids, it does not provide enough information to suggest that the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt is in asteroids that are high or low in reflectivity.
  The passage suggests that intact differentiated asteroids, like Vesta, are relatively rare in the asteroid belt, but it does not provide enough information to suggest that the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt is in either primitive or differentiated asteroids.
Criticism:
  None of the answer choices are directly supported by the information in the passage.
  The passage does not provide enough information to draw a conclusion about the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt being attributed to a specific type of asteroid.
  It's possible that the answer is not mentioned in the passage, so it is important to select the most likely answer from the given choices.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage is discussing the types of asteroids found in the asteroid belt.
  No direct information is provided about the distribution of mass among different types of asteroids.
Thought:
  The table shows the proportion of different types of asteroids in the collection of asteroids that have been studied.
  The majority of asteroids in our collection are primitive asteroids.
  Therefore, it is possible that the majority of asteroids in the asteroid belt as a whole are primitive asteroids.
  Choice A is a possible answer.
Criticism:
  The passage does not provide direct evidence about the distribution of asteroid types in the asteroid belt as a whole.
  The table only shows the proportion of studied asteroids.
  We cannot infer from the table that the same proportions exist in the entire asteroid belt.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the composition of asteroids in the asteroid belt and which types of cosmic objects have survived over the history of the solar system.
  A: Primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, but it is not clear whether they are the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt.
  B: Basaltic asteroids are not mentioned in the passage.
  C: Reflectivity is discussed in relation to the spectra of asteroids and how they may reveal the mantle or core composition, but it is not clear whether high reflectivity is correlated with mass.
  D: The passage suggests that iron objects are stronger than rocky ones and thus more likely to survive in the asteroid belt. 
Thought: 
  The passage does not provide clear evidence indicating that any particular type of asteroid has the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt.
  While the passage does discuss primitive asteroids and iron objects, it does not suggest either of them are more prevalent than other types of asteroids.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C or D.
  None of the Above answer choices are not accepted, so I will select the most likely answer, which is C.
Criticism: 
  While it is not clear that high reflectivity is correlated with mass, the passage does mention that reflectivity could be used to identify rocky versus metallic asteroids or to determine which asteroids have mantle material.
  However, the passage does not provide clear evidence supporting high reflectivity over low reflectivity as the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses the missing mantle problem and the survival of fragments in the asteroid belt.
  The table mentioned in the question is not provided.
Thought:
  The question refers to a table that is not provided, so we cannot answer the question with certainty.
  However, the article suggests that the majority of the asteroids in the asteroid belt are primitive, as they are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
  The article doesn't provide information on whether asteroids are basaltic or high/low in reflectivity, so we can eliminate choices B, C, and D.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: primitive.
Criticism:
  There is no table provided, so it is impossible to know the best answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the formation and survival of asteroids and meteorites.
  The passage mentions primitive asteroids as the parent bodies of chondritic (most common) meteorites.
  The passage does not provide information about the composition of the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt.
Thought:
  The passage does not provide information about the composition of the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt.
  Therefore, the data in the table cannot best support any of the conclusions given.
  None of the above is the best answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The article talks about the "missing mantle problem" in the asteroid belt, and how it is a long-standing puzzle. It also discusses how differentiated asteroids are relatively rare in the asteroid belt today. Primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
  A: Primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites.
  B: Basaltic is not mentioned in the paragraph.
  C: The article mentions that some nonmetallic meteorites have spectra that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very rare, indicating that asteroids high in reflectivity are also rare.
  D: The article does not mention whether asteroids low in reflectivity are more or less common.
Thought: 
  The article discusses how primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites. 
  Chondritic meteorites are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
  Therefore, the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt is likely in primitive asteroids.
  The answer is A: primitive.
Criticism: 
  No specific data table is mentioned in the context provided, so it is difficult to determine which data table the question is referring to.
  However, based on the information provided in the article, it is not completely clear that the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt is in primitive asteroids.
  While chondritic meteorites are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth, the article also mentions that differentiated asteroids are relatively rare in the asteroid belt today, so it is possible that other types of asteroids make up a significant portion of the asteroid belt's mass.

Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: If Meltzer’s findings (Passage 2) are accurate, what can most reasonably be inferred about the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1?
Choices:
  A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  B: They are a product of the global cooling that occurred during the Younger Dryas period.
  C: They were found in highest concentrations at Clovis archaeological sites.
  D: They may have played some role in the tool technology of the Clovis people.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses evidence that supports the theory that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap around 13,000 years ago. 
  The evidence includes geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America, which contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact, including spherules of glass and carbon, and amounts of the element iridium. 
  Passage 2 contests the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis and argues that the quality and accuracy of the dating of the impact sites are suspect. The impact hypothesis proponents remain unconvinced. 
Thought:
  According to Passage 1, the spherules of glass and carbon presented as evidence for an extraterrestrial impact were found at the Clovis archaeological sites, among others. 
  According to Passage 2, Meltzer’s team investigated the dating of the archaeological sites where Clovis artifacts were found and found that only three of the 29 sites in which impact proponents reported evidence for a cosmic collision actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset. 
  Therefore, if we accept Meltzer’s findings, it is reasonable to assume that the spherules of glass and carbon mentioned in Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 talks about research that suggests a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, which caused temperatures to plunge for the next millennium. The study argues that this explosion led to the extinction of the Clovis hunters and large mammals in North America. The evidence for this explosion includes glass and carbon spherules, among other things. 
  Passage 2 discusses a recent study led by David Meltzer that calls into question the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which argues for a cosmic impact that led to the extinction of the Clovis people and many large mammals in North America 12,800 years ago. The study looks at the dating of sites in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision. The results suggest that only three of the 29 sites examined actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago. 
Thought: 
  Passage 1 suggests that the glass and carbon spherules found in sedimentary layers at archaeological sites across North America are evidence of a cosmic impact that led to the extinction of the Clovis hunters and large mammals. If Meltzer's findings in Passage 2 are accurate and the supposed cosmic collision only occurred at three of the 29 sites examined, then it is reasonable to infer that the glass and carbon spherules found at sites that fall outside of the time frame of the Younger Dryas impact could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  Therefore, the most reasonable answer is A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas. 
Criticism: 
  None of the choices specifically mentions Meltzer's study, so it is easy to misinterpret or overlook the relevance of the first sentence of the thought process ("If Meltzer's findings..."). It is also possible that the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in Passage 1 have nothing to do with the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis and were formed from other causes. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the Younger Dryas cooling period, which occurred about 13,000 years ago.
  Passage 1 suggests that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago and caused a cooling period.
  The team in Passage 1 suggests that the debris from the explosion caused the Clovis hunters to disappear and may have caused the extinction of large mammals.
  Passage 1 states that the evidence for the comet or asteroid impact comes from geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers, which contain spherules of glass and carbon, as well as iridium.
  Passage 2 challenges the theory that an impact caused the Younger Dryas cooling period.
  The team in Passage 2 argues that only three of the 29 sites examined actually fall within the time frame of the onset of the Younger Dryas cooling period, and the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years.
Thought:
  The glass and carbon spherules mentioned in Passage 1 are evidence of a comet or asteroid impact.
  Passage 2 argues that the evidence for an impact is not reliable because only three of the 29 sites examined actually fall within the time frame of the onset of the Younger Dryas cooling period.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  The answer is A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the passages that glass and carbon spherules are common and can be formed without an extraterrestrial impact.
  The passages only suggest that the glass and carbon spherules found in the geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers were caused by an extraterrestrial impact.
  Thus, it is possible that the spherules were specifically related to an impact rather than being a common occurrence in geological formations.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes research from 2007 that argues that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, causing a millennium-long cooling period and the disappearance of the Clovis hunters and large mammals. The discovered evidence at the 25 sites includes spherules of glass and carbon that are said to be extraterrestrial in origin due to their iridium content and high concentrations. 
  Passage 2 challenges the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis and focuses on a study that assesses the dating of 29 sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East where some supporters of the impact hypothesis previously reported evidence for a cosmic collision. 
Thought: 
  According to Meltzer's study in Passage 2, only three of the 29 sites that previously reported evidence for a cosmic collision actually fall within the Younger Dryas onset timeframe, and the rest were probably earlier or later. 
  The spherules of glass and carbon that were found at the 25 sites described in Passage 1 may have been formed at a different time than the onset of the Younger Dryas, including before or after this period. 
  Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that the glass and carbon spherules could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas. 
  The answer is A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a team of scientists presenting evidence of a possible extraterrestrial impact in North America around 13,000 years ago that caused the climate to cool and large mammal extinctions.
  The evidence presented by the team includes spherules of glass and carbon, which suggests an extraterrestrial impact.
  Passage 2 discusses David Meltzer’s study, which argues against the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis and challenges the accuracy of the dating of sites that proponents use to support their claims.
  Meltzer argues that only three out of 29 sites examined actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset (about 12,800 years ago), suggesting that the other sites were dated earlier or later by hundreds or thousands of years.
Thought: 
  The team in Passage 1 presented spherules of glass and carbon as evidence of an extraterrestrial impact around 13,000 years ago.
  Meltzer’s study in Passage 2 challenges the accuracy of the dating of sites used to support the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, including the dating of spherules of glass and carbon found in some of these sites.
  If Meltzer’s findings are accurate, then it is reasonable to infer that the spherules of glass and carbon mentioned in Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  Therefore, the answer is A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - Passage 1 describes evidence of a comet or asteroid impact that occurred about 13,000 years ago, leading to a millennium-long cooling period known as the Younger Dryas, extinction of large mammals, and disappearance of Clovis hunters.
  - Passage 1 mentions geochemical evidence at archaeological sites across North America supporting the idea of an extraterrestrial impact. This evidence includes spherules of glass and carbon and iridium.
  - Passage 2 questions the validity of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis and discusses the dating of sites where impact-related evidence was found.
Thought:
  - Meltzer's team (Passage 2) looked at the dating of sites where impact advocates reported evidence for a cosmic collision, including those where Clovis points were found.
  - Only three of the 29 sites examined fell within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
  - If Meltzer's findings are accurate, it would mean that the supposed impact did not occur at the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  - Therefore, the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1, which were part of the geochemical evidence for an extraterrestrial impact, may have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  - Thus, Answer("A") is the most reasonable inference.
Criticism:
  - None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses a comet or asteroid impact that caused temperatures to plunge for the next millennium, which is known as the Younger Dryas, and extinction of the continent's large mammals and disappearance of the Clovis hunters.
  Passage 1 suggests that the geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America indicates that they contain debris that could be formed by an extraterrestrial impact, including spherules of glass and carbon and amounts of the element iridium said to be too high to have originated on Earth.
  Passage 2 challenges the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, citing the only three of the 29 sites examined fell within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
Thought:
  Meltzer's study on the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East that reportedly showed evidence for a cosmic collision only found three of the sites that fell within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
  Therefore, the spherules of glass and carbon mentioned in Passage 1 may also have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  The answer is A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a team of scientists who presented studies suggesting that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap, causing temperatures to plunge and resulting in the extinction of large mammals and Clovis hunters approximately 13,000 years ago.
  The team suggests that evidence for this impact can be found in geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at archaeological sites, which contains spherules of glass and carbon, as well as high levels of iridium not typically found on Earth.
  Passage 2 discusses a study led by David Meltzer, who argues that many of the sites presented by proponents of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis do not fall within the correct time frame of the onset of the Younger Dryas period.
Thought: 
  The last paragraph of Passage 1 mentions spherules of glass and carbon found in the sedimentary layers, as well as high levels of iridium, which are used as evidence of an extraterrestrial impact.
  If Meltzer's findings are accurate and many of the sites presented by proponents of the impact do not fall within the correct time frame, it can be inferred that the spherules of glass and carbon mentioned in Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas period.
  Therefore, the answer is A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct based on the information from the two passages.
  However, it is important to note that the passage does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether the spherules could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes a team of scientists who presented evidence suggesting that a comet or asteroid impacted the northern ice cap of North America approximately 13,000 years ago, causing a millennium-long cooling called the Younger Dryas, and may have led to the extinction of prehistoric animals and Clovis hunters.
  The team's new evidence includes spherules of glass and carbon, and amounts of the element iridium that were too high to have originated on Earth.
  Passage 2 outlines the results of a new study by Meltzer et al. that examines the dating of sites in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision, including sites where Clovis points have been found.
Thought:
  Passage 1 says the team's evidence included spherules of glass and carbon, and that they were found at 25 archaeological sites across North America, including 9 Clovis sites.
  Passage 2 says Meltzer and his team examined the dating of 29 different sites, including some with Clovis points, and found that only three sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago. The rest were probably earlier or later.
  If Meltzer's findings are accurate, then the spherules of glass and carbon could not have been formed at a time that corresponds with the Younger Dryas onset, which was about 12,800 years ago. Thus, they could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  A is the most reasonable answer.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes evidence from multiple studies arguing that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, causing temperatures to plunge for the next millennium and leading to the disappearance of the Clovis hunters as well as the near-simultaneous extinction of the continent's large mammals. 
  The evidence comes from geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25 archaeological sites across North America, including 9 Clovis sites. 
  Certain features of the layers suggest that they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact, including glass and carbon spherules and high levels of the element iridium. 
  Passage 2 discusses a recent paper that examines the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which evidence for a cosmic collision has been reported. 
  The paper argues that when the quality and accuracy of the dating is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
Thought: 
  Passage 1 describes evidence of debris from an extraterrestrial impact, including glass and carbon spherules, at archaeological sites across North America, including Clovis sites. 
  If Meltzer's findings (Passage 2) are accurate and only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, then the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  Therefore, the most reasonable inference is that A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide conclusive evidence for the formation of the glass and carbon spherules at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas. 
  It is still possible that the spherules were formed during the Younger Dryas but at sites that were not included in Meltzer's analysis.
  Therefore, the answer, while reasonable, is not definitively correct.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land  where they were born; and that they areproperty-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose ofall these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a 15 greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction.Any other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women's20 interest to change the assignment they have received.It seems to us incontestable that our common happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in25 the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the30 home? And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a35 manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life's companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand 40 that the good of all demands this of you.\section{Passage 2}Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of45 knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her50 reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an55 orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations....Consider, sir, dispassionately, these60 observations-for a glimpse of this truth seemed to open before you when you observed, "that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it65 was impossible to explain." If so, on what does your constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this70 country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman-prescription.Consider-I address you as a legislatorwhether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their75 own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift 80 of reason?In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination, from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be 85 useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark?
Question: In Passage 2, the author claims that freedoms granted by society's leaders have
Choices:
  A: privileged one gender over the other.
  B: resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue.
  C: caused arguments about the nature of happiness.
  D: ensured equality for all people.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 is discussing the rights of women and their exclusion from education and political participation.
  A: The author is arguing for equal rights for women and against any privileges granted to one gender over the other.
  B: The author argues that education is necessary for women to become virtuous and contribute to society.
  C: The author does not discuss arguments about the nature of happiness.
  D: The author argues for equal rights for women, but does not specifically mention equality for all people.
Thought:
  The author argues that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men.
  Therefore, if society's leaders have granted freedoms that privilege one gender over the other, this would contradict the author's argument.
  Thus, the answer is A: privileged one gender over the other.
Criticism:
  This is a reasonable interpretation of the text, but it is important to note that the author does not specifically mention any freedoms that privilege one gender over the other.
  The author is arguing more generally for the equal rights and opportunities of women.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 is about the author's argument for the rights of women. 
  The author argues that if women are not educated and prepared to be equal companions of men, progress in knowledge and virtue will be stopped, and truth must be common to all.
  The author believes that women's exclusion from education and participation in government shuts them out from the investigation of moral and civil interests.
Thought: 
  The author argues that if women are not granted the same freedoms and rights as men, then progress in knowledge and virtue will be stopped.
  The author gives the example that if children are to be educated to understand patriotism, their mother must be a patriot as well.
  Therefore, the author is claiming that freedoms granted by society's leaders have privileged one gender over the other.
  The answer is A: privileged one gender over the other.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in Passage 2 that freedoms granted by society's leaders have resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue, caused arguments about the nature of happiness, or ensured equality for all people.
  The author's argument is specifically about the rights of women and how their exclusion from education and participation in government is detrimental to progress in knowledge and virtue.
  However, the author does not directly claim that freedoms granted by society's leaders have privileged one gender over the other.
  The closest statement is that the education and situation of women at present shuts them out from investigations of moral and civil interests.
  Therefore, a more accurate answer might be "none of the above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage 2, the author argues for the rights of women on the grounds that they are necessary for the progress of knowledge and virtue, and that women's exclusion from political and civil rights is unjust.
  A: Passage 2 addresses the issue of gender inequality and argues for the rights of women. It does not discuss freedoms granted by society's leaders privileging one gender over the other.
  B: Passage 2 argues that if women are not educated and allowed to participate in society, it will impede the progress of knowledge and virtue, indicating that the author is not in favor of a general reduction in individual virtue.
  C: While the author argues for the rights of women, there is no discussion of arguments about the nature of happiness in Passage 2.
  D: The author is arguing for the rights of women, but does not address equality for all people or freedoms granted by society's leaders with respect to equality.
Thought:
  The author of Passage 2 is advocating for equal rights for women.
  The author argues that women must be educated and allowed to participate in society to prevent a barrier to progress in knowledge and morality.
  Therefore, the author opposes the granting of freedoms by society's leaders that exclude women.
  Further, the author suggests that by denying women's civil and political rights, society is acting contrary to reason and justice.
  So, the correct choice is A: privileged one gender over the other.
Criticism:
  The thought process is correct.
  The author of Passage 2 argues that the exclusion of women from political and civil rights is unjust. 
  The author suggests that this is inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women even though the society believes that it is acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness.
  The correct answer is therefore A: privileged one gender over the other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: Passage 2 discusses the issues of women's education and the subjugation of women. The author argues for the rights of women and claims that women should be educated to become the companions of men. The author believes that the education and situation of women shuts them out from understanding patriotism and morality, and by denying women civil and political rights, leaders force them to remain immured in their families. 
A: The author argues that by denying women civil and political rights, leaders subjugate them and prevent them from co-operating with men to progress knowledge and virtue. The passage discusses women's education and their exclusion from investigations into the moral and civil interest of mankind. It seems that the author is arguing for gender equality and does not believe that one gender should be privileged over the other. 
B: There is no evidence in Passage 2 to suggest that the author claims freedoms granted by society's leaders resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue.
C: The passage does not discuss arguments about the nature of happiness.
D: The passage does not discuss how society's leaders ensured equality for all people.
Thought: 
  The author argues that by denying women civil and political rights, leaders subjugate them and prevent them from co-operating with men to progress knowledge and virtue. The passage focuses on women's education and their exclusion from investigations into the moral and civil interest of mankind. It seems that the author is arguing for gender equality.
  None of the answer choices are a perfect fit, but it seems that the author is arguing against A, for gender equality and against the subjugation of women.
  Therefore, Answer("A") is the best option to select.
Criticism: 
  I believe that the answer choice "A" is the most reasonable choice to select, but it is not a perfect fit. The author argues for gender equality and against the subjugation of women, but the passage does not explicitly discuss whether one gender is privileged over the other. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 is about the author's arguments for women's rights and equality.
  A: The author suggests that society's leaders have subjugated women and denied them civil and political rights, which indicates that one gender is being privileged over the other.
  B: The author does not directly address the idea of a reduction in individual virtue resulting from societal freedoms.
  C: The author does not suggest that freedoms granted by society's leaders have caused arguments about the nature of happiness.
  D: The author argues that women should be granted the same civil and political rights as men, which indicates a striving for equality.
Thought:
  The author argues that society's leaders have denied women civil and political rights.
  This means that one gender is being privileged over the other.
  Therefore, the author does not claim that freedoms granted by society's leaders have ensured equality for all people.
  The answer is A: privileged one gender over the other.
Criticism:
  The thought process and answer are both correct based on the given passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses the author's argument for women's rights.
  A: The author argues against the subjugation of women and for consideration of their rights and reason, so it is possible that she is discussing gender privilege.
  B: The author argues for educating women so that they can become virtuous companions for men and contribute to progress through knowledge. There is no mention of freedoms leading to reduced virtue.
  C: The author discusses the connection between education, reason, and the consideration of civil and moral interests of mankind, but there is no explicit mention of arguments about happiness.
  D: The author argues for the consideration of women's rights and reason, but it is unclear if the author claims that freedoms ensure equality for all people.
Thought: 
  The author believes that women must be educated in order to become virtuous and contribute to progress through knowledge.
  The author questions the legitimacy of denying civil and political rights to women when men fight for their freedom and to judge for themselves based on their reason.
  Therefore, the author is likely claiming that freedoms granted by society's leaders have privileged one gender over the other. 
  The answer is A: privileged one gender over the other.
Criticism: 
  The thought process is sound based on the text provided, as the author argues against denying civil and political rights to women based on gender and believes they must be educated to contribute to progress through knowledge. 
  However, it is also possible that the author is arguing strictly against gender privilege, rather than freedoms granted by society's leaders. 
  The author may be suggesting that men historically have been the leaders making the laws and policies in their favor, leading to privilege and subjugation of women. 
  Either answer could be correct based on interpretation.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage argues for women's rights in society.
  The passage states that if women are not educated, it will prevent progress in knowledge and virtue.
  The passage argues that women should have the same freedoms as men to ensure individual and societal happiness.
Thought: 
  The author argues that if women are not given education and freedoms, it will hinder progress in knowledge and virtue.
  The author argues that women should have the same freedoms as men to ensure individual and societal happiness.
  The author does not argue that one gender is privileged over the other, but rather argues for equal rights.
  The author does not state that freedoms have led to a reduction in virtue or caused arguments about happiness.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: ensured equality for all people. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses the education and political freedom of women and argues that society's leaders should grant women more freedoms, such as the right to participate in government, in order to promote virtue and knowledge.
  A: The author suggests that society's leaders have privileged men over women by denying women civil and political rights.
  B: The author argues that educating women will promote knowledge and virtue, the opposite of a general reduction in virtue.
  C: The author does not mention arguments about the nature of happiness in this passage.
  D: While the author argues for greater equality for women, they do not claim that society's leaders have ensured equality for all people.
Thought: 
  The author argues that if women are not educated and given political rights, society will suffer from a lack of knowledge and virtue.
  The author critiques society's leaders for denying women civil and political rights.
  Therefore, the author suggests that society's leaders have privileged men over women.
  The answer is A: privileged one gender over the other.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. 
  Passage 2 directly critiques society's leaders for excluding women from civil and political rights and perpetuating gender-based inequality.
  Therefore, the author suggests that society's leaders have privileged men over women.
  There is no mention of arguments about the nature of happiness or general reductions in virtue in this passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses the author's argument that women must be educated in order to contribute to society and progress knowledge and virtue.
  A: The author suggests that the oppression of women is unjust and inconsistent with the idea that both genders possess the gift of reason, implying that rights have been unequally granted to men and women.
  B: While the author argues that women's lack of education is a hindrance to the progress of knowledge and virtue, there is no indication that it has resulted in a general reduction of individual virtue.
  C: The author does not directly discuss arguments about the nature of happiness.
  D: The author suggests that women have been denied political and civil rights, implying that equality has not been ensured for all people.
Thought:
  The author argues that women must be educated to progress knowledge and virtue, and criticizes society for denying them civil and political rights.
  The denial of rights and education specifically to women suggests that one gender may have been privileged over the other.
  Therefore, the answer is A: privileged one gender over the other.
Criticism:
  There is no direct statement in the passage that one gender is privileged over the other. The author specifically argues against denying women civil and political rights, which implies an inequality of rights, but not necessarily a privileging of one gender over the other.
  However, the notion that one gender is privileged over the other is a plausible interpretation of the author's argument that denying women education and civil rights is unjust and inconsistent with the idea that both genders possess reason. Therefore, A may still be the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
	Passage 2 is about the author's argument for women's rights.
	A: The author mentions the privileged of one gender over the other, and argues against this idea.
	B: The author argues that if women are not educated and allowed to participate in society, it will impede progress in knowledge and virtue.
	C: The author argues that women must be allowed to understand and pursue their own happiness, and that this is connected to the greater good of society.
	D: The author argues for greater freedom and equality for women, but does not claim that this has been achieved yet.
Thought: 
	The author argues that women must be educated and allowed to participate fully in society.
	He claims that this is necessary for progress and for the greater good of all.
	He argues against the idea that men should have exclusive rights to judge what is best for themselves and women, and that this is unjust.
	Therefore, the author does not claim that freedoms granted by society have ensured equality for all people (Choice D).
	The answer is not C or D.
Criticism: 
	You are correct that the author argues against the privileged of one gender over the other, but that is only part of the larger argument he is making.
	While the author does argue that the lack of education and participation for women results in a reduction in individual virtue, that is not the main point he is making (Choice B).

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Follow the money and you will end up in space. That's the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on mining beyond Earth.Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for 5 Space Engineering Research, the event brought together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar scientists, and government agencies that are all working to make space mining a reality.The forum comes hot on the heels of the 102012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms. Planetary Resources of Washington says it will launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years, while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020 . Another15 commercial venture that sprung up in 2012, Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to the moon, including to potential lunar miners.Within a few decades, these firms may be meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as20 platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital for personal electronics, such as yttrium and lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who transformed the western United States, the first space miners won't just enrich themselves. They also hope25 to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds with Earth, in which the materials extracted and processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered for space-based projects.In this scenario, water mined from other 30 worlds could become the most desired commodity. "In the desert, what's worth more: a kilogram of gold or a kilogram of water?" asks Kris Zacny of HoneyBee Robotics in New York. "Gold is useless. Water will let you live."35 Water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary 40 refuelling stations. Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into 45 concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.\section{Passage 2}The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting from discovery to economics. The past year has seen a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few0 billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain: the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could enrich us all.But before the miners start firing up their rockets, we should pause for thought. At first glance, space55 mining seems to sidestep most environmental concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids, and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences -both here on Earth and in space -merit careful consideration.60 Part of this is about principles. Some will argue that space's "magnificent desolation" is not ours to despoil, just as they argue that our own planet's poles should remain pristine. Others will suggest that glutting ourselves on space's riches is not an65 acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable ways of earthly life.History suggests that those will be hard lines to hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public that such barren environments are worth preserving.70 After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even fewer people will experience them than have walked through Antarctica's icy landscapes.There's also the emerging off-world economy to consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and 75 beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely been broached-and the relevant legal and regulatory framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are 80 often reluctant to engage with such questions.One speaker at last week's space-mining forum in Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that regulation should be avoided. But miners have much to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit 85 exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek one out

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out what effect, if any, all that driving around the  labyrinthine streets of London might have oncabbies' brains. When she brought sixteen taxi drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an MRI scanner, she found one surprising and important difference. The right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain known to beinvolved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in the cabbies-a small but very significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of that way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains. The moreyears a cabbie had been on the road, the more pronounced the effect.The brain is a mutable organ, capable-within limits-of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known asneuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons-that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain's basic anatomical structurewas more or less static. Maguire's study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.After her groundbreaking study of London cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to mental athletes. She teamed up with ElizabethValentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic monograph Superior Memory, to study ten individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were-like the Londoncabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners  and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it was possible that they might discover anatomical 45 differences in the brains of the memory champs, evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized themselves in the process of doing all that intensive remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the imaging data, not a single significant structural50 difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects. What's more, on every single test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes' scores came back well within the normal range. The 55 memory champs weren't smarter, and they didn't have special brains.But there was one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects: When the researchers looked at which parts of the 60 brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry. According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be 65 working in overdrive for the mental athletes.Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial70 navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first glance, this wouldn't seem to make any sense. Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in 75 their mind's eye when they were trying to learn three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating like London cabbies when they're supposed to be remembering the shapes of snowflakes?Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes 80 to describe exactly what was going through their minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said they were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, and distributing those images along familiar spatial85 journeys. They weren't doing this automatically, or because it was an inborn talent they'd nurtured since childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural activity that Maguire's fMRIs turned up were the result of training and practice
Question: Which question was Maguire's study of mental athletes primarily intended to answer?
Choices:
  A: Does the act of memorization make use of different brain structures than does the act of navigation?
  B: Do mental athletes inherit their unusual brain structures, or do the structures develop as a result of specific activities?
  C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
  D: What is the relationship between general cognitive ability and the unusual brain structures of mental athletes?
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Eleanor Maguire conducted a study on London cabbies and discovered differences in their brain structure.
  Maguire conducted a study on mental athletes to find out if their brains are structurally different from normal people's brains.
  Maguire's study on the mental athletes did not reveal any significant structural difference between their brains and normal brains.
  However, the mental athletes' brains activated different circuitry when they were memorizing.
  The mental athletes' neural activity was the result of training and practice, not inborn talent.
Thought:
  Maguire conducted a study on mental athletes to find out if their brains are structurally different from the rest of us.
  The study did not find any significant differences in brain structure between mental athletes and normal people.
  But the study did find that mental athletes use different brain circuitry when memorizing things.
  Therefore, the study was intended to answer whether heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  The answer is C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
Criticism:
  There is also evidence in the text to suggest that Maguire and her team wanted to know how mental athletes' brains had reorganized themselves in the process of memorizing.
  However, this is not the primary question that the study was intended to answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Maguire conducted a study of ten mental athletes to determine if their brains were structurally different than those of the control group. 
  The study utilized MRIs to scan the brains of both groups while they memorized information.
  The mental athletes did not have significantly different brain structures from those of the control group, and their cognitive abilities were within the normal range.
Thought: 
  Maguire's study of mental athletes aimed to determine if their brains were structurally different from those of a control group.
  They studied ten mental athletes who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship.
  Maguire wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were like London cabbies' structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.
  The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners and asked them to memorize 3-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned.
  Maguire's study found that, even though the brain structures of mental athletes were similar to those of the control group, the mental athletes had a different neural activity pattern.
  They were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding.
  The mental athletes were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images and distributing those images along familiar spatial journeys.
  Therefore, the question that Maguire's study of mental athletes was primarily intended to answer was: does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure? The answer is C.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence to suggest that Maguire's study intended to answer if "the act of memorization make use of different brain structures than does the act of navigation" (A), if "mental athletes inherit their unusual brain structures, or do the structures develop as a result of specific activities" (B), or if "there is a relationship between general cognitive ability and the unusual brain structures of mental athletes" (D).
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a study by Eleanor Maguire that examined the brains of London taxi drivers and found that their hippocampus was 7% larger than usual due to all the navigating they do.
  The study also looked at the brains of mental athletes who had competed in the World Memory Championship to see if their brains were structurally different from non-memory champions.
  The study found that there were no significant structural differences between the two groups. However, when mental athletes were memorizing information, they were engaging several regions of the brain involved in visual memory and spatial navigation.
Thought:
  Maguire's study of mental athletes was intended to answer the question of whether heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  The study found that the mental athletes' brains were indistinguishable from the control subjects in terms of structural differences.
  However, when memorizing information, mental athletes were engaging several regions of the brain that were less active in control subjects, suggesting that they were using normal brain structure in an unusual way.
  This suggests that heightened memorization ability reflects an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
Criticism:
  There is no direct evidence in the passage that Maguire's study was intended to answer this specific question.
  The passage suggests multiple possible questions that Maguire's study could have been intended to answer.
  However, given the evidence in the passage, it is most likely that the question of whether heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure was one of the primary questions that Maguire's study was intended to answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Eleanor Maguire wanted to study the effect that wayfinding in London had on cabbies' brains.
  She found that the right posterior hippocampus was larger in the cabbies.
  Maguire then studied mental athletes to determine if their brains were structurally different.
  The mental athletes' brains were not different from control subjects in any significant way.
  The mental athletes used different parts of their brains for memorization than control subjects.
Thought: 
  Maguire's study of mental athletes was intended to answer a question about their brains.
  It was observed that mental athletes did not have significantly different brain structures compared to control subjects.
  The functional MRI scans showed that the mental athletes used different parts of their brains for memorization.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of Maguire's study of mental athletes was to determine if heightened memorization ability reflected abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  The answer is C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.

  Therefore, Maguire's study of mental athletes was primarily intended to answer whether heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a study in which Maguire examined the brains of mental athletes to determine if their brains were different from those of control subjects, and if their brains had reorganized themselves in the process of intensive remembering. 
  A: The study did not focus on whether the act of memorization makes use of different brain structures than navigation.
  B: The study did not address whether mental athletes inherit unusual brain structures.
  C: The study appears to primarily be aimed at determining if heightened memorization ability reflects differences in brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  D: The study did not directly investigate the relationships between general cognitive ability and the the unusual brain structures of mental athletes.
Thought: 
  The study's primary aim was to investigate if mental athletes had structural differences in their brains or if they were making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.
  The study found that the mental athletes' brains were anatomically similar to those of control subjects, and that the mental athletes were engaging different circuitry.
  Based on this, it can be inferred that the study was primarily intended to answer whether heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  The answer is C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a study conducted by Eleanor Maguire on mental athletes to determine structural and functional differences in their brains compared to non-athletes during the memorization process.
  A: The question of whether the act of memorization uses different brain structures than navigation is mentioned in the passage, but it is not the primary objective of Maguire's study on mental athletes.
  B: The question of whether mental athletes inherit their unusual brain structures or if the structure develops due to specific activities is not addressed in the passage.
  C: The question of whether heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure is the primary objective of Maguire's study on mental athletes, as mentioned in the passage.
  D: The passage does mention that mental athletes' scores in general cognitive ability were within the normal range, but it is not the primary objective of Maguire's study on mental athletes.
Thought:
  Maguire and her team studied mental athletes to determine whether their brains were structurally different from non-athletes during the memorization process.
  The researchers found that the brain structures of the mental athletes were indistinguishable from those of the control subjects.
  The mental athletes' scores in general cognitive ability were within the normal range.
  However, the mental athletes engaged different regions of the brain in their memorization process than the control subjects, indicating an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  Maguire's study on mental athletes primarily intended to answer the question of whether heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
Criticism: 
  The thought process and answer are valid based on the information provided in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Eleanor Maguire conducted a study on London cabbies to understand the effect of way-finding around London on their brains. The study found that the right posterior hippocampus of cabbies, a part of the brain involved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in cabbies.
  Maguire conducted another study on mental athletes to find out whether their brains were structurally different from the rest of us or they were just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess. When the researchers reviewed the imaging data, not a single significant structural showed up in the brains of the memory champs. However, there was one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects: When the mental athletes were memorizing, they were activating entirely different circuitry, including regions of the brain known to be involved in visual memory and spatial navigation.
Thought: 
  What was the purpose of Maguire's study of mental athletes?
  The study was intended to determine whether mental athletes inherited their unusual brain structures, or the structures develop as a result of specific activities and either heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  Since there was no significant structural difference in the brains of mental athletes, the aim of the study may have been to understand how mental athletes make better use of memory abilities that we all possess through their training and practice.
  Therefore, Maguire's study of mental athletes was primarily intended to answer whether heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  The answer is C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
Criticism: 
  The answer to this question is somewhat subjective and may depend on interpretation.
  However, C seems to capture the main aim of Maguire's study of mental athletes. 
  Although A may seem plausible as it deals with brain structures involved in both navigation and memorization, it does not address the question of how mental athletes are making better use of memory abilities. 
  Option B is not discussed in the passage.
  Option D is also not discussed in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Eleanor Maguire's research found that the right posterior hippocampus of London cabbies was larger than normal.
  London cabbies have enlarged right posterior hippocampi because of their wayfinding activity.
  Maguire researched top performers in the World Memory Championship to compare their brain structure to that of the control subjects.
  The brain structure of mental athletes was similar to the control subjects.
  Mental athletes engaged different areas of their brain, including those involved in visual memory and spatial navigation.
Thought: 
  Maguire's study of mental athletes was intended to determine if their brains were different from typical individuals.
  Mental athletes do not have different structural brains from typical individuals.
  While the structure of their brain wasn't different, mental athletes were using different areas of the brain for memorization.
  They converted information into images and spatial journeys to help with memorization.
  Therefore, Maguire's study of mental athletes was primarily intended to answer whether heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  The answer is C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Eleanor Maguire led a study on London taxi drivers that found differences in their brains related to spatial navigation.
  Maguire later led a study on mental athletes, comparing their brain activity to a control group while memorizing different types of information.
  Mental athletes did not have significantly different brain structures from the control group.
  Mental athletes did use different brain regions than the control group, especially those associated with spatial navigation and visual memory.
Thought: 
  Maguire's study of mental athletes was focused on comparing the brain activity of memory champions to that of a control group while memorizing information. 
  Maguire wanted to determine if the ability to memorize large quantities of information was related to a specific brain structure, or if it reflected an unusual use of existing brain structures.
  Therefore, the primary question Maguire's study was intended to answer was if heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  The answer is C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct and covers the key points of the passage.
  No significant evidence is presented in the passage to support any of the other answer alternatives as the primary question of Maguire's study.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, what potential criticism might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model?
Choices:
  A: Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect.
  B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  C: Volkov's direct application of an electrical current would have been objectionable to Hodick and Sievers.
  D: Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Venus flytrap and how it encodes, stores, and recalls information in order to close when an appropriate prey is on its leaves.
  Hodick and Sievers proposed a model that involved the electrical charge of the leaf storing the memory.
  Volkov's experiment demonstrated that an electrical current could make the Venus flytrap close without any direct touch.
Thought:
  Volkov's experiment demonstrated that an electrical charge could make the Venus flytrap close without any direct touch.
  This indirectly supports Hodick and Sievers's model that an external stimulus (such as electrical charge) leads to the calcium ions being concentrated, which is necessary for the Venus flytrap to close.
  Therefore, there might not be any criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Option A and C are not supported by the passage.
  Option D is not correct because Hodick and Sievers did not have access to Volkov's technology, but that was not a potential criticism.
  The only option left is B, which suggests that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Criticism:
  This criticism is not supported by the passage;
  Volkov's measurements actually support Hodick and Sievers's model.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how plants encode information when their trigger hairs are touched.
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that the Venus flytrap encodes information about how many trigger hairs are touched in the electric charge of its leaf, and that the plant must maintain a high enough level of calcium so that a second trigger push the total concentration of calcium over a threshold to make the trap close.
  Volkov and his colleagues demonstrated that Venus flytraps close when given electrical charges, even without direct touch to the trigger hairs.
Thought: 
  Volkov's testing generally supports Hodick and Sievers's model because it confirms that Venus flytrap's trapping mechanism involves electric charges. 
  However, the passage does not provide enough information to determine if Volkov's testing corroborates the central element of Hodick and Sievers's model: that Venus flytrap stores information in concentrations of calcium levels, which requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second trigger push the total concentration of calcium over a threshold to make the trap close.
  Therefore, the potential criticism that might be made of Volkov's testing is that it did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  The answer is B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how scientists have tried to understand how Dionaea muscipula (Venus flytrap) encodes and stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched before snapping closed around its prey.

  The researchers Hodick and Sievers proposed a model that the flytrap stored information on the number of touched hairs in the electric charge of its leaf. They observed an electric action potential when the trigger hair was touched, which causes calcium channels to open and increases the concentration of calcium ions. They propose that a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold needed to spring the trap, and if it doesn't happen quickly enough, the memory is lost.

  Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama tested the model with an electrical current to induce the trap to close, and they found that as long as fourteen microcoulombs flowed between the two electrodes, the trap would close.

Thought:
  Volkov and his colleagues attempted to test the model proposed by Hodick and Sievers. 
  They used an electrical current to induce the trap to close instead of touching the trigger hairs.
  Their results determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. 

  The passage does not indicate any major potential criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model. 

Criticism: None of the choices adequately reflect any potential criticism of Volkov's work.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes research into how the Venus flytrap remembers when to close around prey. 
  Hodick and Sievers proposed the idea that the electric charge of the flytrap's leaf encodes and stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched. 
  Volkov and his colleagues discovered that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. 
  They modified Hodick and Sievers's model and determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
Thought: 
  Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model sought to determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. 
  While they did not measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases.
  Therefore, Volkov's measurements corroborated a central element, or hypothesis, of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  There was no indication that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect.
  There is also no indication that Hodick and Sievers would have found direct application of an electrical current objectionable. 
  Therefore, the potential criticism that might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that his measurements did not corroborate a central element of the model.
  Answer(B).
Criticism: 
  Based on the information given, there appears to be no criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model that could be made. Indeed, the passage suggests that Volkov's work supported Hodick and Sievers's model and helped to refine it. 
  Answer(B) still remains the most likely answer given the available information. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes research on the physiology of the Venus flytrap.
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that the Venus flytrap stored information on the number of hairs touched in the electric charge of its leaf, and that the trap needed a relatively high concentration of calcium to close.
  Volkov and colleagues demonstrated that electricity caused the Venus flytrap to close and determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
Thought:
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that the Venus flytrap encoded information about prey in the electric charge of its leaf, which induced calcium channels to open in the trap, and that the trap needed a relatively high concentration of calcium to close.
  Volkov's testing demonstrated that indeed electricity (rather than direct touch) caused the Venus flytrap to close and determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close, but it's not clear from the text whether Volkov's measurements corroborated Hodick and Sievers's model or not.
Criticism:
  The text doesn't suggest that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect, so A is incorrect.
  The text doesn't suggest that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model, so B is incorrect.
  The text doesn't suggest that Volkov's direct application of an electrical current would have been objectionable to Hodick and Sievers, so C is incorrect.
  The text doesn't suggest that Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers, so D is incorrect.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Venus flytrap and how it encodes and stores information about potential prey.
  Hodick and Sievers proposed a model for how the plant uses the electric charge of its leaf to store information about how many trigger hairs have been touched and when it should spring shut.
  Volkov and colleagues tested this model and found that electrical charge could trigger the trap to close without direct touch to the trigger hairs.
Thought: 
  The question is asking for a potential criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Based on the information presented in the passage, one possible criticism might be that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Specifically, Hodick and Sievers proposed that the Venus flytrap needs a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to spring shut and that a second hair needs to be touched to push the concentration over a certain threshold.
  Volkov did not directly measure calcium levels, but he did find that an electrical charge could trigger the trap to close without any direct touch to the trigger hairs.
  If calcium concentration is a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model, then Volkov's measurements would not directly corroborate that element.
  Therefore, B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model, would be a potential criticism of Volkov's testing of the model.
Criticism: 
  The passage provides some evidence to support the idea that calcium concentration is a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model, so this might be a valid criticism.
  However, the passage does not explicitly state that this is a central element of their model, and it is possible that Volkov's measurements were consistent with other aspects of the model that were not discussed in the passage.
  Therefore, this answer might not be the only valid criticism of Volkov's testing.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Venus flytrap's method of encoding and storing information regarding the presence of prey on its leaves. 
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that the plant stored this information in the electric charge of its leaves, specifically in the concentration of calcium ions in the trap.
  Volkov and his colleagues demonstrated that the Venus flytrap could be made to close using electrical current. 
Thought: 
  The passage discusses Hodick and Sievers's model and Volkov's testing of this model. According to Hodick and Sievers, the Venus flytrap stores information regarding potential prey in the electric charge of its leaves. Volkov and his colleagues demonstrated that the Venus flytrap can be made to close using electrical current. Therefore, the potential criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model might be that his measurements did not corroborate a central element of their model, specifically the role of calcium ions in the storage of information. 
  The passage does not mention any misunderstanding of Hodick and Sievers's model by Volkov, any objection to Volkov's direct application of an electrical current by Hodick and Sievers, or any lack of available technology for Hodick and Sievers to perform similar tests. 
Conclusion: 
  Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a proposed model for how the Venus flytrap stores information about prey touching its hairs before closing its traps.
  Hodick and Sievers propose that the Venus flytrap stores the information about trigger hairs in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model suggests that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair is not enough to achieve this threshold.
  Volkov and his colleagues tested this model with fine electrodes.
  Their experiment showed that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close, and they could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
Thought:
  The passage does not suggest any specific criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  It does mention that Volkov's measurements did not measure calcium levels, but this does not suggest that there is a criticism of his testing. 
  Furthermore, the passage does not indicate that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect.
  Choice C is not relevant to the passage's discussion of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Based on the passage, it seems unlikely that there is a potential criticism that might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how the Venus flytrap remembers to close its trap when it has captured prey.
  Hodick and Sievers propose that the Venus flytrap stores a memory in the electric charge of its leaf.
  Opening a calcium channel is integral to the Venus flytrap's process of remembering.
  Volkov and colleagues later demonstrated that electricity causes the Venus flytrap to close, and they measured the amount of electrical charge needed to make the trap close.
Thought:
  Volkov conducted experiments with electrodes to apply electrical charges to the Venus flytrap.
  It is not clear from the passage how precisely the experiments by Volkov may have corroborated Hodick and Sievers' model.
  So, one potential criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that his measurements did not corroborate a central element of the model.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Criticism:
  Actually, there is no basis in the passage for this potential criticism.
  The passage suggests that Volkov's experiment supported Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Therefore, the correct answer is None of the Above. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a scientific model proposed by Hodick and Sievers, which suggests that electric charge in the Venus flytrap's leaf is responsible for signaling the trap to close.
  Volkov and his colleagues used fine electrodes to apply an electrical current to the flytrap's open lobes, causing them to close.
Thought: 
  The passage indicates that Volkov's experiment supported Hodick and Sievers's model. They used electrical current, just like Volkov, and found that the current charged the trap, causing it to close. Depending on the success of Hodick and Sievers's research, the criticism mentioned in the question may be that Volkov's measurements did not support Hodick and Sievers' model.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not indicate that Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model would be subject to any major criticism.
  Therefore, None of the Above is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Context: Voters need to understand the prosaic details of.complex policies. Most have staked out positions on.these issues, but they are not often reasoned.positions, which take hard intellectual work. Most.citizens opt instead for simplistic explanations,.assuming wrongly that they comprehend the nuances.of issues..Psychological scientists have a name for this.easy, automatic, simplistic thinking: the illusion of.explanatory depth. We strongly believe that we.understand complex matters, when in fact we are.clueless, and these false and extreme beliefs.shape our preferences, judgments, and actions—.including our votes..Is it possible to shake such deep-rooted.convictions? That’s the question that Philip.Fernbach, a psychological scientist at the University.of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business, wanted to.explore. Fernbach and his colleagues wondered if.forcing people to explain complex policies in.detail—not cheerleading for a position but really.considering the mechanics of implementation—.might force them to confront their ignorance and.thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. They.ran a series of lab experiments to test this idea..They started by recruiting a group of volunteers in.their 30s—Democrats, Republicans, and.Independents—and asking them to state their.positions on a variety of issues, from a national flat.tax to a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions..The volunteers indicated how strongly they felt about.each issue and also rated their own understanding of.the issues. Then the volunteers were instructed to.write elaborate explanations of two issues. If the issue.was cap and trade, for example, they would first.explain precisely what cap and trade means, how it is.implemented, whom it benefits and whom it could.hurt, the sources of carbon emissions, and so forth..They were not asked for value judgments about the.policy or about the environment or business, but.only for a highly detailed description of the.mechanics of the policy in action..Let’s be honest: Most of us never do this..Fernbach’s idea was that such an exercise would.force many to realize just how little they really know.about cap and trade, and confronted with their own.ignorance, they would dampen their own.enthusiasm. They would be humbled and as a result.take less extreme positions. And that’s just what.happened. Trying—and failing—to explain complex.policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about.being well-informed. They became more moderate in.their views as a result..Being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a.policy is not the same as trying to sell that policy..In fact, talking about one’s views can often.strengthen them. Fernbach believes it’s the slow,.cognitive work—the deliberate analysis—that.changes people’s judgments, but he wanted to check.this in another experiment. This one was very similar.to the first, but some volunteers, instead of.explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it..The results were clear. Those who simply listed.reasons for their positions—articulating their.values—were less shaken in their views. They.continued to think they understood the policies in.their complexity, and, notably, they remained.extreme in their passion for their positions..Polarization tends to reinforce itself. People are.unaware of their own ignorance, and they seek out.information that bolsters their views, often without.knowing it. They also process new information in.biased ways, and they hang out with people like.themselves. All of these psychological forces increase.political extremism, and no simple measure will.change that. But forcing the candidates to provide.concrete and elaborate plans might be a start; it gives.citizens a starting place.

  Requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail would force them to confront the complexities of the issues.
  This could lead to voters being better informed and taking less extreme positions.
  Therefore, requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is most likely to reduce political extremism among the citizenry.
  The answer is B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held.
Criticism:
  The proposed method of reducing political extremism is supported by the experiments conducted by Fernbach and his colleagues in the passage.
  However, it is not clear if this method would be effective on a larger scale or if there are any unintended consequences of this approach.
  Additionally, there may be other factors that contribute to political extremism that are not addressed in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses how most citizens have extremist positions on political issues due to the illusion of explanatory depth, which causes them to believe they understand complex matters when in reality they do not. Psychological scientists conducted experiments to see if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would weaken their extremist stands on issues. The experiments showed that those who were forced to articulate the mechanics of policies became more moderate in their views.
Thought: Requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail could force citizens to confront their own ignorance about the issues. By making citizens more aware of their lack of knowledge, they would be more likely to take less extreme positions.
Criticism: The passage does not discuss the option of forming organized groups of people who share their most deeply held convictions or promoting awareness of charities as ways to reduce political extremism.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses how psychological forces contribute to political extremism among the citizenry.
- The author suggests that forcing voters to explain complex policies in detail would force them to confront their ignorance and dampen their enthusiasm for extremist positions.
Thought:
- The article suggests that making people explain complex policies in detail could reduce political extremism.
- This is because it would force people to confront their own ignorance and dampen their enthusiasm for extremist positions.
- Therefore, requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held would be the most likely action to reduce political extremism among the citizenry.
- None of the other options in the answer choices directly address the issue of reducing political extremism.
Criticism:
- There is no definitive proof that requiring politicians to explain their policies in more detail would significantly reduce political extremism among the citizenry.
- Other factors, such as media bias, propaganda, and social media algorithms, could also play a significant role in shaping people's political beliefs and values.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how most citizens tend to opt for simplistic explanations and assume they understand complex issues, when in fact they do not.
  The notion of the illusion of explanatory depth is introduced - the idea that people believe they understand complex matters, when in fact they are clueless.
  The passage reports that lab experiments conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues revealed that forcing people to explain complex policies in detail can undermine their illusions of being well-informed and thus dampen their enthusiasm and lead to less extreme positions.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that explaining complex policies in detail can force many to realize how little they actually know about them.
  This can lead to increased moderation and less extreme positions among citizens.
  Requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held could encourage citizens to think more deeply about the issues and lead to a reduction in political extremism.
  Therefore, B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held is the most likely action to reduce political extremism among the citizenry.
Criticism:
  There is no mention of organizing groups of people who share deeply held convictions in the passage.
  Promoting awareness of charities that provide opportunities to donate money to worthy but underfunded causes is not directly related to reducing political extremism.
  Hosting events that encourage people who hold opposing points of view to interact with one another could potentially reduce political extremism by promoting understanding and dialogue, but this is not discussed in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses an idea to reduce political extremism among the citizenry.
- The idea is based on forcing people to explain complex policies in detail, which would require them to confront their own ignorance and lead to less extreme positions.
- The idea was tested in a series of lab experiments, where participants were asked to write elaborate explanations of policies.
Thought:
- The idea presented in the passage to reduce political extremism among the citizenry is to force politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail.
- If citizens are forced to confront their own ignorance about complex policies, they would be more likely to take less extreme positions.
- Based on this, the answer would be B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held.
Criticism:
- The idea presented in the passage to reduce political extremism among the citizenry is to force citizens to explain complex policies in detail, not politicians.
- Requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail might help to provide more information to citizens, but it's not the main idea presented in the passage to reduce political extremism among the citizenry.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses research conducted by Philip Fernbach, a psychological scientist, on whether requiring people to explain complex policies in detail might weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The lab experiments conducted by Fernbach and his colleagues involved having volunteers write elaborate explanations of policies in action but not giving value judgments.
  Volunteers who completed the writing exercise were then less likely to hold extreme positions on the policy area.
Thought: 
  The article suggests that requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail before an election might help to reduce political extremism by requiring people to confront their own lack of knowledge.
  By forcing people to articulate in detail the mechanics of a policy, they will realize how little they actually know about the policy and, as a result, take less extreme positions.
  Requiring politicians to provide concrete and elaborate plans might be a way to force citizens to confront their own ignorance about policy areas and thus reduce extremism.
  Therefore, the most likely action to reduce political extremism among the citizenry is B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held.
Criticism: 
  While the article suggests that requiring politicians to provide concrete and elaborate plans might help reduce political extremism among the citizenry, it may not necessarily be the only or most effective solution.
  Other actions such as promoting diversity and inclusion, addressing wealth inequality and education gaps, and promoting critical thinking and media literacy might also help reduce political extremism.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the issue of political extremism among voters.
  The authors argue that many citizens have a false sense of understanding complex policy issues and that forcing them to articulate the mechanics of policy implementation can lead to the realization of their ignorance and a dampening of their extreme views.
Thought:
  Requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail before an election might force voters to confront their ignorance of complex policy issues and lead to more moderate views.
  Forming organized groups of people who share their most deeply held convictions might reinforce political extremism.
  Promoting awareness of charities that provide opportunities to donate money to worthy but underfunded causes might encourage philanthropic behavior, but there is no clear link between this behavior and political extremism.
  Hosting events that encourage people who hold opposing points of view to interact with one another might promote understanding and reduce animosity, but it is unclear whether it would actually lead to more moderate views or reduced political extremism.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held.
Criticism:
  Requiring politicians to explain their policies may help inform voters and reduce ignorance, but it may also have the unintended consequence of discouraging candidates who do not have a firm grasp of the issues from running for office.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the issue of political extremism and how it is caused by people's illusions of explanatory depth, or thinking they understand complex issues when they do not.
  The author describes an experiment where individuals were forced to explain complex policies in detail, which resulted in individuals becoming more moderate in their views.
Thought:
  The experiment showed that requiring individuals to explain complex policies in detail helped to reduce political extremism.
  Therefore, the action that would most likely reduce political extremism is B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention in the passage of forming organized groups of people who share their most deeply held convictions and whether that would reduce political extremism.
  Promoting awareness of charities that provide opportunities to donate money to worthy but underfunded causes and hosting events that encourage people who hold opposing points of view to interact with one another may be positive actions, but the passage does not suggest that they would reduce political extremism.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The passage is about political extremism and the illusion of explanatory depth.
- The author is presenting research by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues on how to reduce political extremism.
- Fernbach's idea is that asking people to explain complex policies in detail will force them to confront their ignorance and thus weaken their extremist stands on issues.
Thought:
- The question asks which action would most likely reduce political extremism.
- The only option that relates to Fernbach's research and addresses the topic of reducing political extremism is B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held.
Criticism:
- There is no evidence in the passage to support the other options (A, C, D).
- The passage specifically discusses how forcing individuals to explain policies in detail will reduce extremism, not forming groups, donating to charities, or encouraging interaction.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses the issue of political extremism and the illusion of explanatory depth, which causes people to believe they understand complex policies when they actually do not.
Thought:
  The article suggests that forcing people to explain the mechanics of policy implementation in detail rather than simply stating their positions can help them realize how little they actually know. 
  This realization can lead to a reduction in political extremism.
  Therefore, requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held would most likely reduce political extremism among the citizenry.
  The best answer is B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held.
Criticism:
  The article does not discuss the formation of organized groups sharing their convictions, promotion of charities, or hosting events with opposing points of view. 
  Therefore, it is not clear whether these actions would be effective in reducing political extremism.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

  He believes concentrated power can be wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many.
  Parsons believes that political parties are human and driven to maintain their power, often at the expense of the people.
  He ultimately argues against entrusting the management of all affairs to finite man and to political parties.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of Parsons's speech is to bring to light inconsistencies within the current political system.
  Answer: D
Criticism: 
  Your analysis seems correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Parsons gave a speech.
  Parsons talks about his experience and how he transitioned politically.
  He talks about why he converted to anarchism and why he opposes government restrictions.
  Parsons believes that men will abuse power, and that the government uses their power to retard progress.
  A: Parsons does mention a shift in his political views, but the primary purpose of the speech is not to discuss a political philosophy that is starting to lose favor.
  B: Parsons talks about his belief that the individual should have the fullest development of their potential, which he thinks can be achieved without government restrictions.
  C: Parsons outlines why he has switched to anarchism from political socialism, however, the primary objective of his speech is not to provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.
  D: Parsons argues that concentrated power can be always wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many. He also argues that governments use their power to silence the voice of discontent and thereby retard progress. Therefore, he highlights inconsistencies within the current political system.
Thought: 
  Parsons talks about his transition to anarchism.
  He argues that men will abuse power when they hold political power. 
  He opposes any form of authority in society.
  He thinks governments retard progress and silence the voice of discontent.
  Therefore, a primary purpose of Parsons's speech is to bring to light inconsistencies within the current political system.
  The answer is D.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. 
  The purpose of the speech is mainly to highlight the inconsistencies of the government, rather than to present a "new" approach to meeting the needs of oppressed groups.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The speaker, Parsons, initially believed that government could alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed but changed his mind after studying the origin and tendency of governments.
  Governments use their concentrated power to retard progress by silencing the voice of discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the machinations of the scheming few.
  Parsons learned that concentrated power can be wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many, and that governments never lead but follow progress.
  Parsons found it unsafe to entrust the management of all society's affairs to finite man, managed by the party which happens to come into power because men will abuse power when they possess it.
Thought: 
  Parsons's speech argues that governments cannot alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed and cannot be trusted with managing all society's affairs.
  Instead, Parsons finds Anarchism to be the proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society because it opposes any form of authority in society and therefore removes government restrictions.
  The primary purpose of Parsons's speech is to provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology, namely Anarchism.
  Therefore, the answer is C: provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.
Criticism: 
  The statement that Parsons's speech is to provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology, namely Anarchism, is a bit limited.
  While Parsons does advocate for anarchism as a better alternative to government, the primary purpose of his speech is to highlight the shortcomings of government and to convince the audience that it is unsafe to entrust all affairs to a government, regardless of their promises.
  So, a better answer would be D: bring to light inconsistencies within the current political system.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
   Parsons gave a speech that focused on the issues of labor and government.
   Parsons gave a close study of the origin, history and tendency of the government and concluded that concentrated power can be wielded in the interest of the few at the expense of the many.
   Parsons learned that it made no difference what fair promises a political party out of power might make to the people, when they securely established in control of society's affairs, they were after all, but human with all the human attributes of the politician.
Thought:
  Parsons gave a close and careful study of government and concluded that power can be wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many, irrespective of political parties.
  Parsons provided a rationale for adopting anarchism as a different ideology from the current system that was based on government restrictions.
  The primary purpose of Parsons's speech is to provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.
  Therefore, the answer is C: provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.
Criticism:
  You are correct that Parsons gave a close study of the government and concluded that concentrated power can be wielded in the interest of the few at the expense of the many, and that he provided a rationale for anarchism as a solution to the current political system.
  However, the question focuses on the primary purpose of Parsons' speech rather than what the speech was about.
  In this case, it is not entirely clear whether Parsons' primary purpose was simply to provide a rationale for anarchism, or whether he also aimed to bring to light inconsistencies within the current political system, outline a new approach to meeting the needs of oppressed groups, or discuss a political philosophy that is starting to lose favor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses his shift from political socialism to anarchism due to his belief that government can be an oppressive force.
  A: The speech does not mention any political philosophy that is losing favor.
  B: The speech does mention the "Labor Question" and worker's rights, but the author's primary purpose is not to outline a new approach to meeting their needs.
  C: The author discusses his shift from political socialism to anarchism, but his purpose is not simply to provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.
  D: The author criticizes the current political system and reveals its flaws, particularly in its potential for suppression and oppression.
Thought:
  Parsons's speech is primarily concerned with advocating for anarchism as a solution to the problems created by government control and pointing out the inconsistencies within the political system.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: bring to light inconsistencies within the current political system.
Criticism:
  There is some mention of a "Labor Question" and the rights of oppressed groups, but the more significant and overarching purpose of the speech is to criticize the current political system.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses his experience with the "Labor Question" during the 1877 railroad strike.
  He initially believed that governments could be used to alleviate oppression.
  However, after studying the history and tendencies of governments, he became convinced that such concentrated power can be wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many.
  The author argues that governments never lead; they follow progress and that progress is only made when the voice of the protesting minority can no longer be silenced.
  He concludes that entrusting the management of all social and industrial affairs to any political party would be dangerous.
Thought: 
  Parsons's speech outlines his political philosophy and why he turned to anarchism.
  He discusses the faults and failings of government and why he is convinced that government power can be abused.
  He provides a rationale for his belief in anarchism and why he believes it is the proper condition for the fullest development of the individual units in society.
  Based on this, the primary purpose of Parsons's speech is to provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.
  The answer is C: provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.
Criticism: 
  The other options are not completely wrong:
  A - The author is discussing his shift from a political Socialist to anarchism, so in a sense, the political philosophy he espouses is losing favor. However, this is not the primary purpose of his speech.
  B - While the author does highlight the need to meet the needs of oppressed groups, the primary purpose of his speech is not to outline a new approach to do this. He is primarily discussing his shift to anarchism and providing rationale for this decision.
  D - While the author does bring to light inconsistencies within the current political system, this is not the primary purpose of his speech. He is primarily discussing his shift to anarchism and providing rationale for this decision.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The text is a speech given by someone named Parsons.
  Parsons first became interested in the Labor Question during the great railroad strike of 1877.
  Parsons initially believed that government could be used to alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed.
  However, a closer study convinced Parsons that governments used their power to silence the voice of the discontent.
  Parsons contends that concentrated power can be wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many.
  Parsons learned that political parties will do whatever it takes to remain in power, which includes building up a powerful machine to crush all opposition.
  Parsons believes that entrusting the management of all of society's affairs to a political party is not the safest or best policy.
  Parsons fears what a political party having all authority would mean for the kind of books used in schools, the government's control of literature, press, and other activities.

  The speaker favors a non-political approach to achieving Socialism, which emphasizes individual freedom and opposes authority in society.
Thought:
  Parsons's speech primarily discusses his views on government and political parties.
  He begins by recounting his early interest in the "Labor Question" and his initial belief in the power of government to help oppressed groups.
  However, he soon came to believe that concentrated power could be harmful to society and led to the suppression of dissenting voices.
  He ultimately rejected political parties and turned to Anarchism as a non-political approach to achieving Socialism.
  Therefore, a primary purpose of Parsons's speech is to provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.
  The answer is C: provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.
Criticism:
  The speaker does not discuss a political philosophy that is losing favor, but rather outlines his own views on government and political parties.
  While Parsons does discuss alternative approaches to solving societal problems, the primary focus of the speech is his own beliefs.
  Additionally, while the speech does highlight inconsistencies within the political system, this is not its main purpose.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: Which statement best describes the relationship between the two passages?
Choices:
  A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
  B: Passage 2 explains the scientific question addressed by the central hypothesis developed in Passage 1.
  C: Passage 2 discusses possible implications of the central hypothesis summarized in Passage 1.
  D: Passage 2 identifies evidence in favor of the central hypothesis advanced in Passage 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes a hypothesis that a comet or asteroid explosion caused a millennium-long cooling and the extinction of the Clovis hunters and large mammals.
  Passage 2 critiques evidence for the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, including deposits of iridium, microscopic diamonds, and magnetic particles.
Thought:
  Passage 1 and 2 discuss similar topics. 
  Passage 1 outlines a hypothesis based on scientific evidence that an extraterrestrial impact caused climate cooling and the extinction of large animals.
  Passage 2 critiques the evidence that has been presented to support the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  Therefore, Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
  The answer is A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Criticism:
  There are no flaws in this reasoning.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes the central hypothesis that a comet or asteroid impacted the Earth causing climate cooling and the extinction of large mammals. The supporting evidence comes from geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at archaeological sites across North America, and this hypothesis has been contested by other scientific explanations.
  Passage 2 critiques the hypothesis of the younger Dryas impact by analyzing the quality and accuracy of the dating in 29 different sites in America, Europe, and the Middle East where impact evidence has been reported.
Thought:
  Passage 1 presents the central hypothesis that an asteroid or comet exploded above or on the northern ice cap around 13,000 years ago, leading to climatic cooling and the extinction of large mammals.
  Passage 2 critiques the hypothesis by examining data from 29 different sites on the quality and accuracy of their dating.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two passages is that Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1, and debunks the evidence used to support it.
  The answer is A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Criticism: 
  You are correct. The relationship between the two passages is that Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1, and debunks the evidence used to support it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses a hypothesis about a comet or asteroid explosion that caused significant climate change and extinction of large mammals in North America.
  Passage 2 criticizes the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, a specific version of the central hypothesis discussed in Passage 1.
Thought:
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 share a common topic of extraterrestrial impact hypotheses about climate change and extinction events.
  However, Passage 2 specifically critiques the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which is a version of the central hypothesis discussed in Passage 1.
  Passage 2 aims to refute the evidence and dating methods used to support the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  Therefore, the best description of the relationship between the two passages is A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Criticism:
  There are indeed similarities between the two passages, but it is important to note that Passage 2 specifically critiques the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which is just one version of the broader central hypothesis discussed in Passage 1.
Action: Answer("A")

  Passage 1 describes a hypothesis put forward by some scientists at a meeting, which claimed that the extinction of large mammals and the cooling of the climate in North America about 13,000 years ago can be explained by a comet or asteroid exploding above or on the northern ice cap. The hypothesis is supported by certain features of the sedimentary layers at archaeological sites across the continent, which suggest that they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact. The efficacy of this theory, however, is contested by other researchers who present evidence pointing out other reasons for the observations made by the earlier team.
  Passage 2 discusses a scientific critique of the central hypothesis envisioned by Passage 1. Researchers claim that the hypothesis of extraterrestrial impact cannot be sustained with current data. 
Thought:
  Passage 1 presents a hypothesis and its evidential support, whereas Passage 2 contradicts it with new and additional data not acknowledged previously.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two is critical, not complementary; Passage 2 critiques and nullifies the validity of the evidence presented in Passage 1 by analyzing the methods and accuracy of the data.
  The correct answer is A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Criticism:
  There are no complementary sentiments shared between the two passages. 
  Passage 2 offers no support or explanation for the hypothesis discussed in Passage 1.
  The answer to the question is not a generic answer but should be derived by analyzing the relationship between the two passages.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 summarizes a hypothesis that argues for an extraterrestrial impact causing climate cooling and extinction of the Clovis hunters and large mammals.
  Passage 2 presents a critique of the hypothesis arguing that the evidence used to support the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis is not reliable. 
Thought:
  Passage 1 summarizes a new hypothesis about an extraterrestrial impact causing multiple events; Passage 2 critiques the same hypothesis, presenting evidence that supports their counter argument. 
  Therefore, Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
  The answer is A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Criticism:
  There is no scientific question addressed in Passage 1, and Passage 2, while discussing evidence, critiques the hypothesis and not the question.
  Therefore, it can be argued that B and C cannot hold true.
  There is no evidence in Passage 2 in favor of the hypothesis, so D cannot be the correct answer. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Passage 1 discusses a hypothesis that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, causing temperatures to plunge for the next millennium.
- Passage 2 discusses the evidence presented to support the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which asserts that a cosmic collision led to the onset of the Younger Dryas cooling period around 12,800 years ago.
Thought:
- Passage 1 and Passage 2 both discuss hypotheses related to cosmic collisions and their impact on the Earth's climate.
- Passage 1 discusses a specific hypothesis related to a comet or asteroid that exploded above the northern ice cap around 13,000 years ago.
- Passage 2 critiques the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which asserts that a cosmic collision led to the onset of the Younger Dryas cooling period around 12,800 years ago.
- The two passages do not seem to be directly related to each other in terms of discussing the same hypothesis or evidence.
- Therefore, it is likely that the best answer is A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Criticism:
- The two hypotheses are related to cosmic collisions, but do not seem to be directly addressing the same hypothesis or evidence.
- It is possible to argue that Passage 1 and Passage 2 are related in terms of discussing scientific hypotheses related to cosmic collisions impacting the Earth's climate.
- However, the most direct relationship between the two passages is that Passage 2 critiques the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which is not the same as the hypothesis discussed in Passage 1.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a hypothesis that claims a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, which caused temperatures to plunge and explains the climate cooling and disappearance of the Clovis hunters and the extinction of large mammals. 
  Passage 2 presents a critique of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, arguing that the supposed evidence does not support the theory, and that the supposed impact fails on both theoretical and empirical grounds. 
  
Thought: 
  Passage 1 outlines the hypothesis that a comet or asteroid exploding above the northern ice cap caused various environmental changes approximately 13,000 years ago, resulting in climate cooling, disappearance of certain groups of people and animals, and other effects throughout the continent.
  Passage 2 presents a counterargument to the hypothesis described in Passage 1, by highlighting how the evidence presented in support of the hypothesis is contested and arguing that the dating of the supposed evidence does not support the theory.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two passages is that Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
  The answer is A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Criticism: 
  There is no doubt about the relationship between the two passages - Passage 2 is definitely presenting a critique of the hypothesis described in Passage 1.
  Therefore, there is no flaw in facts, logic, or reasoning.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 presents a hypothesis put forward by a group of scientists about the cause of a climate event and extinction of animals in North America.
  Passage 2 critiques the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis put forward by proponents, which suggests that a cosmic collision caused these events.
Thought:
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 discuss different aspects of a scientific hypothesis.
  Passage 1 presents a hypothesis and argues for it with evidence.
  Passage 2 critiques the hypothesis by examining the dating of sites where proponents have found evidence for a cosmic collision.
  Therefore, the statement that best describes the relationship between the two passages is A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Criticism:
  There are no flaws in the facts or reasoning presented.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses a hypothesis that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris across the North American continent and causing temperatures to plunge for the next millennium.
  The team argues that this idea explains multiple observations, including the cooling climate, the disappearance of the Clovis hunters, and the near-simultaneous extinction of large mammals.
  Passage 2 presents a critique of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, including various kinds of evidence that were claimed to support the hypothesis, and arguments against the scientific validity of these claims.
Thought:
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 describe a hypothesis about the cause of various observed phenomena.
  Passage 1 presents the central hypothesis that a comet or asteroid explosion caused these events.
  Passage 2 presents a critique of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis and arguments against its validity.
  Therefore, Passage 1 and Passage 2 have an adversarial relationship, with Passage 2 serving as a critique of the central hypothesis presented in Passage 1.
  The answer is A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Criticism:
  There is no mention of the scientific question addressed by the hypothesis in either passage.
  There is no discussion of possible implications of the hypothesis in either passage.
  There is no identification of evidence in favor of the hypothesis in Passage 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a hypothesis that an asteroid or comet exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago, causing temperatures to plunge for the next millennium.
  The hypothesis is supported by multiple observations, including climate cooling, the disappearance of Clovis hunters, and the near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large mammals.
  Passage 1 also notes that the current hypothesis is not the only explanation for these events. Other leading hypotheses include a change in ocean circulation that brought about the onset of the millennium-long cooling, causing the Clovis hunters to disappear, and potentially dooming prehistoric beasts due to the change in climate.
  Passage 2 is a critique of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  The critique argues that of the 29 sites examined, only three actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
Thought:
  Passage 1 describes a hypothesis, and Passage 2 is a critique of that hypothesis, specifically the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  Passage 2 argues that only three of the 29 sites examined actually fall within the timeframe of the Younger Dryas onset.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: Passage 2 presents a critique of the central hypothesis described in Passage 1.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that Passage 2 is a critique of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  However, it is not a critique of the hypothesis described in Passage 1, which suggests an asteroid or comet exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago. This hypothesis, while related to the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, is not the same.
  Therefore, the answer could also be C: Passage 2 discusses possible implications of the central hypothesis summarized in Passage 1. Although it does not discuss the hypothesis itself, it does discuss the implications of a cosmic collision on North American climate and the extinction of large mammals.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden  with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are 5 the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the10 procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those15 doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty20 years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that25 makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively30 no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us35 then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old40 family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so 45 long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The0 questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that55 procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will60 object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men65 have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our70 brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the75 gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this "civilization" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in80 them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?
Question: The central claim of the passage is that
Choices:
  A: educated women face a decision about how to engage with existing institutions.
  B: women can have positions of influence in English society only if they give up some of their traditional roles.
  C: the male monopoly on power in English society has had grave and continuing effects.
  D: the entry of educated women into positions of power traditionally held by men will transform those positions.
Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the procession of educated men and women, and the significance of joining or not joining this procession. It also discusses the importance of thinking critically about existing institutions and professions. The passage does not mention a male monopoly on power, traditional roles of women, or the transformation of positions held by men.
Thought: The central claim of the passage is that individuals must consider whether or not to join the procession of educated men and women, and think critically about existing institutions and professions. The passage does not focus specifically on women, nor does it suggest that women must give up traditional roles in order to have positions of influence. It also does not make claims about a male monopoly on power or the transformation of positions held by men.
Criticism: The thought accurately reflects the main themes of the passage. However, it is important to note that the passage does include some discussion of women, particularly in regards to their historical role in pushing for social and political change. While the passage does not make the claim that women must give up traditional roles, it does suggest that women have had to think and work in unconventional ways to effect change.
Action: Answer("None of the above")

  However, other interpretations may also be plausible.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the procession of the sons of educated men, and the opportunity for educated women to engage with existing institutions. It mentions the possibility of women gaining positions of influence in society, but does not suggest that they must give up their traditional roles to do so. The passage does not focus on the male monopoly on power in English society, but rather on the question of whether educated women wish to join the procession of educated men and where that procession is leading. 
Thought: The passage is primarily concerned with the question of whether educated women want to engage with existing institutions and, if so, on what terms, and where this engagement will lead. It does not suggest that women must give up their traditional roles to gain positions of influence, nor does it focus on the male monopoly on power. 
Answer: A: educated women face a decision about how to engage with existing institutions.
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the procession of sons of educated men and poses a series of questions about joining that procession, the direction it is leading, and the role of women in English society. The passage does not address the issue of women giving up traditional roles or about the effects of male monopoly on power in English society.
Thought: 
  The central claim of the passage is that people, particularly women, need to make decisions about joining the procession of educated men and consider where that procession is leading. The passage emphasizes that educated women have traditionally done their thinking from hand to mouth and that they must continue to think independently even as they take positions of power formerly held only by men.
  The answer is A: educated women face a decision about how to engage with existing institutions.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage does not address the issue of women giving up traditional roles or about the effects of male monopoly on power in English society, but the central claim is broader than simply a decision for women - it is a decision for all people about how to engage with existing institutions and where the procession of educated men is leading.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:

There is no discussion of women giving up their traditional roles or the male monopoly on power in English society. 
Thought: Overall, the passage is focused on the idea of educated individuals and their role in society. It suggests that individuals must consider whether they want to join the procession of "educated men" and where it is leading them. There is a hint that women might join this procession and transform it, but this is not the central claim of the passage. 
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes a procession of educated men and the importance of asking questions about whether to join it and on what terms.
  A: While the passage mentions some brief references to the daughters of educated men and encourages women to continue thinking, the central claim of the passage is not about educated women facing a decision about how to engage with existing institutions.
  B: The passage does not suggest that women can only have positions of influence in English society by giving up traditional roles.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

A: There is no mention in the passage of Threestep being a summer retreat for vacationers. August is described as a "hellish month" to arrive in Georgia, implying that people are not arriving for vacation.
B: The passage describes Threestep as a small rural town. The people are described as having "hard times" but being in the mood for a little excitement. There is no mention of a university or any large institutions.
C: There is no mention of Threestep being home to a prominent university. The passage describes Miss Spivey attending Barnard College in New York City.
D: There is no mention of Threestep being a comfortable suburb. The passage describes the burned grass alongside the tracks where people gathered to welcome Miss Spivey, implying that the town may have been struggling economically. 
Thought: 
  The author describes Threestep as a small town and mentions residents having "hard times," suggesting an economically depressed area. 
  Therefore, the best answer choice is B: small rural town.
Criticism: 
  You are correct, the passage describes Threestep as a small rural town.
  The other answer choices are not supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Threestep is a place located in Georgia.
  The citizens of Threestep are in the mood for a little excitement when Miss Spivey arrives.
  Miss Spivey is a schoolteacher.
Thought: 
  Threestep is not presented as a summer retreat for vacationers since there is no mention or implication of any such activity.
  Threestep is presented as a small rural town since it is mentioned that the citizens of Threestep were in the mood for a little excitement when Miss Spivey arrived.
  Threestep is not presented as a town that is home to a prominent university or a comfortable suburb since there is no mention or implication of any such activity.
  Therefore, Threestep is mainly presented as a small rural town.
  The answer is B: small rural town.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes Threestep, Georgia as the town where Miss Grace Spivey arrived as a new schoolteacher.
  Miss Spivey's arrival is presented as a positive event, and many of the people gathered seem excited for a little excitement.
  Threestep, Georgia is described as a place that is suffering from hard times.
Thought:
  The passage describes Threestep as a small rural town.
  Many of the people gathered were excited, likely because they are looking for excitement where there might not be much.
  Given the portrayal of the town, it is unlikely that it is a summer retreat or a comfortable suburb, nor is it home to a prominent university, as no mentions of such a university have been introduced.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: small rural town.
Criticism:
  There is nothing in the passage that explicitly tells us that Threestep is a small rural town.
  It is possible that the town could be larger or have a different character.
  However, the passage does provide some contextual clues that suggest Threestep is a small rural community.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Another man might have thrown up his.hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters.acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with.Line satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of.a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course.knew that he must proliferate his sources of.revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni.for tending the tube wells would not even begin to.suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off.a condemned electric motor—condemned by him..He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at.the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken.radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not.demur even when asked to fix watches, though that.enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned.him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took.apart ever kept time again..K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived.mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,.Nawab would place himself night and day at the door.leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled.grove of ancient banyan trees where the old.farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator.glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the.household machinery, the air conditioners, water.heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an.engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer.in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he.almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the.same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and.lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in.Lahore..Harouni of course became familiar with this.ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on.his tours of inspection, but morning and night could.be found standing on the master bed rewiring the.light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water.heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the.psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say.a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his.nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him.to go ahead..“Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to.the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube.wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is.but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have.earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to.show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties.as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive.me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud.hunger within than disgrace in the light of day..Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”.The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of.speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at.his nails and waited for the breeze to stop..“What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”.Unauthorized copying or reuse of any part of this page is illegal. **22 CONTINUE**.“Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your.service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,.on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the.many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery.fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a.bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I.first had the good fortune to enter your employment..I beg you, sir, let me go.”.“And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing.that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly.care one way or the other, except that it touched on.his comfort—a matter of great interest to him..“Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could.somehow limp along, at least until I train up some.younger man.”.The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt.expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the.disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a.brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even.managed to extract an allowance for gasoline..The motorcycle increased his status, gave him.weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and.asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he.knew absolutely nothing. He could now range.further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,.now he could spend every night with his wife, who.had begged to live not on the farm but near her.family in Firoza, where also they could educate at.least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road.ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way.to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni.lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new.machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every.knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,.seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial.wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to.whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears.almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his.arrival.
Question: The passage states that the farm managers react to Nawab receiving a motorcycle with
Choices:
  A: disgust.
  B: happiness.
  C: envy.
  D: indifference.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Nawabdin asked his employer for a motorcycle and was granted one.
  The passage mentions that the farm managers were not pleased with Nawabdin's new motorcycle, but it does not indicate their specific reaction.
Thought:
  The passage does not provide enough information to know the farm managers' reaction to Nawabdin receiving a motorcycle.
  Therefore, the answer is D: indifference.
Criticism:
  Your interpretation is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Nawabdin received a brand-new motorcycle from his employer Harouni.
Thought:
  The text describes the reaction of the farm managers to Nawabdin receiving a brand-new motorcycle. 
  Nawabdin's new motorcycle is not a direct threat or concern to the farm managers, so they would not react negatively to him receiving the motorcycle.
  There is no indication in the passage that the farm managers were envious or indifferent to Nawabdin receiving the motorcycle.
  The only option left is that the farm managers reacted to Nawab receiving the motorcycle with happiness.
  Therefore, the answer is B: happiness.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Nawabdin worked for K. K. Harouni and tended to his tube wells, household machinery etc. He also tried multiple things to increase his revenue. Nawabdin received a motorcycle from K. K. Harouni with an allowance for gasoline.
Thought:
  The passage does not mention how the farm managers reacted to Nawab receiving a motorcycle. So, we cannot determine the correct answer with certainty.
  While the passage mentions that Harouni's crops were good and he felt expansive in front of the fire, which led to Nawab receiving a brand-new motorcycle, there is no information about how the farm managers reacted to this. 
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Nawab is a servant of K.K. Harouni.
  Nawab tends tube wells, set up a mill, tried fish-farming, fixed broken radios, and watches, etc. 
  Nawab had difficulty fulfilling his duties due to physical ailments.
  Harouni owns lands stretching from there to the Indus and has 17 tube wells that Nawab tends to.
  Nawab explains his predicament and asks for a motorcycle to do his duties.
  Harouni buys Nawab a Honda 70 motorcycle and an allowance for gasoline.
Thought: 
  The passage states that the farm managers react to Nawab receiving a motorcycle, but we need to identify how they react.
  The passage does not provide this information explicitly.
  However, it states that the crops have been good, and Harouni is feeling expansive in front of the fire when he buys Nawab a brand-new motorcycle.
  This suggests that Nawab's receiving of a motorcycle is not met with disgust by the farm managers, or else Harouni would not have bought the motorcycle.
  Therefore, the answer is D: indifference.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage does not provide explicit information about the farm managers' reactions.
  However, the fact that Harouni buys Nawab a brand-new motorcycle suggests that his decision is not met with disgust or resistance from the farm managers, who are more concerned with profits and efficiency.
  It is also possible that the passage is implying that the farm managers are jealous or envious of Nawab's newfound status, but this is not explicitly stated.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Nawabdin asks for a motorcycle because he can no longer bicycle between farms due to age and injuries.
  K. K. Harouni, the landowner, gives Nawabdin a brand-new Honda 70 motorcycle with an allowance for gasoline.
Thought:
  There is a possibility that farm managers would react negatively to Nawabdin receiving the motorcycle since it would allow him to operate more independently and perhaps distance himself further from their authority on the farms.
  The passage does describe the farm managers as being disgusted with something but it is not related to Nawabdin receiving a motorcycle.
  Therefore, we cannot infer their reaction to Nawab receiving the motorcycle.
  The answer is D: indifference.
Criticism: 
  The passage is silent on the farm managers' reaction to Nawab receiving the motorcycle. So the correct answer is "None of the above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Nawab is an employee of K.K. Harouni who owns a large piece of land with farms and tube wells in the State of Indus.
  Nawab sets up a little one-room flour mill, tries his hand at fish-farming and fixes radios.
  He also tends the household machinery for K.K. Harouni, who rarely visited his farms.
  Nawab finally asks K.K. Harouni for a motorcycle to replace his bicycle that has become difficult for him to operate.
Thought: 
  Nawab is a hardworking employee who is trying to solve his difficulties in his life.
  When Nawab receives a brand-new motorcycle, the farm managers are displeased.
  So, the correct answer is A: disgust.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence from the passage about the reaction of farm managers when Nawab receives his new motorcycle.
  So, the answer cannot be determined from the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Nawab of course knew that he must proliferate his sources of revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni for tending the tube wells would not even begin to suffice. 
  K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived mostly in Lahore. 
  Whenever the old man visited, Nawab would place himself night and day at the door leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled grove of ancient banyan trees where the old farmhouse stood. 
  Grizzled, his peculiar aviator glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the household machinery, the air conditioners, water heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer in an Atlantic gale. 
  The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. 
Thought:
  The farm managers are disgusted when Nawab receives a brand-new motorcycle. 
Criticism:
  The passage supports the thought that the farm managers are disgusted when Nawab receives a brand-new motorcycle. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Nawabdin is the protagonist of the passage.
  He works for K. K. Harouni and tends to his farms.
  Nawabdin tries to find new sources of revenue to support his family of 12 daughters.
  After asking for it, he receives a new Honda 70 motorcycle.
Thought:
  The passage mentions that "much to the disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70." 
  Therefore, the farm managers reacted to Nawab receiving a motorcycle with disgust.
  The answer is A: disgust.
Criticism:
  You are correct.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Nawabdin has worked for K.K. Harouni who owns farms where Nawabdin works to maintain the tube-wells.
  Nawabdin asked for a release from his duties since he couldn't tend to the tube wells anymore. 
  He also asked for a motorcycle while explaining that he could use it to continue his duties.
  Harouni felt expansive and gave Nawabdin a new motorcycle which he used to range much further.
Thought:
  Nawabdin received a new motorcycle after he explained his plight to Harouni.
  He received an allowance for gasoline.
  The farm managers reacted to the news of Nawabdin receiving a motorcycle.
  Given that Nawabdin was given a new motorcycle, the farm managers' reaction could have been positive, negative, or indifferent.
  There is no information in the passage to suggest whether the farm managers' reaction was negative, positive, or indifferent.
  Therefore, the answer to this question is D: indifference.
Criticism:
  Your analysis of the passage is accurate, the text does not give any information concerning the farm manager's reaction when Nawabdin received a new motorcycle, therefore, this answer is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Nawabdin received a brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70, from K. K. Harouni after asking for a solution for his inability to bicycle around the farms. 
  Nawabdin's request for a motorcycle was based on his physical limitations due to age and previous injuries. 
  Farm managers are mentioned as part of the story, but no information is given about their reaction to Nawabdin's receiving a motorcycle.

Thought: 
  The passage does not state how the farm managers responded to Nawabdin receiving a motorcycle.
  There is no basis to choose any of the options because the passage does not provide any information on how the farm managers reacted.

Criticism:
  Our original thoughts were correct. There is no information given regarding how the farm managers reacted to Nawabdin receiving a motorcycle.
  Choosing any of the options would be speculation.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.

  Therefore, Passage 2 seems to challenge the reliability and credibility of the research results discussed in Passage 1.
  The answer is D: Passage 2 challenges the reliability of research results discussed in Passage 1.
Criticism: 
  There are no explicit references in Passage 2 that challenge the reliability of research results discussed in Passage 1. 
  However, the passage does present a critique of the tools and methodologies used in tiger population assessment and suggests that the population estimates reported in the WWF study are flawed.
  Therefore, the answer D: Passage 2 challenges the reliability of research results discussed in Passage 1 still seems to be the most appropriate answer among the options.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes a new report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that suggests that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.
  Passage 2 discusses the use of scientific methods to estimate tiger numbers and range, and explores the problems with current conservation practices.
Thought: 
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 both discuss the issue of tiger conservation.
  Passage 1 discusses a new report by WWF that found that tiger populations may be growing.
  Passage 2 discusses the use of scientific methods to estimate tiger numbers and range, and criticizes current conservation practices.
  Passage 2 even criticizes the report mentioned in Passage 1 for relying on flawed methodologies.
  Therefore, Passage 2 challenges the reliability of research results discussed in Passage 1.
  The answer is D: Passage 2 challenges the reliability of research results discussed in Passage 1.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the findings of a new report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) about the growing population of tigers in the wild.
  Passage 2 discusses the methods used to estimate tiger numbers and range, and critques the conservation practices of governmental and nongovernmental agencies.
Thought: 
  Passage 2 discusses the methodologies used to estimate tiger populations and range in several countries.
  Passage 2 also critiques the conservation practices that relied on outdated methods and tools as highlighted in Passage 1.
  Therefore, passage 2 critiques the research results and conservation solutions discussed in Passage 1.
  The best choice that states the relationship is A: Passage 2 compares and critiques the conservation solutions recommended in Passage 1.
Criticism: 
  There are no statements or implications in Passage 2 that question the professional credibility of the scientists profiled in Passage 1, which eliminates choice B.
  While Passage 2 suggests the application of new methodologies and techniques, the passage primarily critiques the flawed methodologies used in estimating tiger populations and challenges the reliability of conservation practices, which eliminates choices C and D.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 reports a new study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that suggests the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years.
  Passage 2 discusses how photographic capture-recapture and large-scale occupancy modeling is used to estimate tiger numbers and range and how it is not widely adopted by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies.
Thought:
  Passage 1 reports a new study by the WWF that suggests the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years.
  Passage 2 discusses how photographic capture-recapture and large-scale occupancy modeling is used to estimate tiger numbers and range and how it is not widely adopted by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies.
  Passage 2 also critiques the methods used by the WWF and other conservation agencies to estimate tiger populations.
  The two passages share a common theme of tiger conservation efforts and how they are measured, with Passage 2 critiquing the methods used to measure success.
  Therefore, Choice A: Passage 2 compares and critiques the conservation solutions recommended in Passage 1, is the best choice.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Voters need to understand the prosaic details of.complex policies. Most have staked out positions on.these issues, but they are not often reasoned.positions, which take hard intellectual work. Most.citizens opt instead for simplistic explanations,.assuming wrongly that they comprehend the nuances.of issues..Psychological scientists have a name for this.easy, automatic, simplistic thinking: the illusion of.explanatory depth. We strongly believe that we.understand complex matters, when in fact we are.clueless, and these false and extreme beliefs.shape our preferences, judgments, and actions—.including our votes..Is it possible to shake such deep-rooted.convictions? That’s the question that Philip.Fernbach, a psychological scientist at the University.of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business, wanted to.explore. Fernbach and his colleagues wondered if.forcing people to explain complex policies in.detail—not cheerleading for a position but really.considering the mechanics of implementation—.might force them to confront their ignorance and.thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. They.ran a series of lab experiments to test this idea..They started by recruiting a group of volunteers in.their 30s—Democrats, Republicans, and.Independents—and asking them to state their.positions on a variety of issues, from a national flat.tax to a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions..The volunteers indicated how strongly they felt about.each issue and also rated their own understanding of.the issues. Then the volunteers were instructed to.write elaborate explanations of two issues. If the issue.was cap and trade, for example, they would first.explain precisely what cap and trade means, how it is.implemented, whom it benefits and whom it could.hurt, the sources of carbon emissions, and so forth..They were not asked for value judgments about the.policy or about the environment or business, but.only for a highly detailed description of the.mechanics of the policy in action..Let’s be honest: Most of us never do this..Fernbach’s idea was that such an exercise would.force many to realize just how little they really know.about cap and trade, and confronted with their own.ignorance, they would dampen their own.enthusiasm. They would be humbled and as a result.take less extreme positions. And that’s just what.happened. Trying—and failing—to explain complex.policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about.being well-informed. They became more moderate in.their views as a result..Being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a.policy is not the same as trying to sell that policy..In fact, talking about one’s views can often.strengthen them. Fernbach believes it’s the slow,.cognitive work—the deliberate analysis—that.changes people’s judgments, but he wanted to check.this in another experiment. This one was very similar.to the first, but some volunteers, instead of.explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it..The results were clear. Those who simply listed.reasons for their positions—articulating their.values—were less shaken in their views. They.continued to think they understood the policies in.their complexity, and, notably, they remained.extreme in their passion for their positions..Polarization tends to reinforce itself. People are.unaware of their own ignorance, and they seek out.information that bolsters their views, often without.knowing it. They also process new information in.biased ways, and they hang out with people like.themselves. All of these psychological forces increase.political extremism, and no simple measure will.change that. But forcing the candidates to provide.concrete and elaborate plans might be a start; it gives.citizens a starting place.
Question: The passage implies that when conducting his laboratorywork, Fernbach would have been most surprised by which finding?
Choices:
  A: No link was found between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions.
  B: After volunteers were asked to analyze a complicated political issue, their understanding of it did not increase.
  C: When volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
  D: When volunteers were asked questions about complex issues, those with the most extreme views were found to have the best overall understanding of them.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a study conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues, in which they explore whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  A: The study does not explicitly mention a link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions.
  B: The study suggests that asking volunteers to explain complicated political issues in detail weakens their extremist views and makes them more moderate.
  C: The study suggests that asking volunteers to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy does not weaken their extremist views.
  D: The study does not suggest that those with the most extreme views have the best overall understanding of complex issues.
Thought:
  The question asks what Fernbach would have been most surprised by.
  The study suggests that forcing people to explain complex policies in detail weakens their extremist views and makes them more moderate.
  Therefore, Fernbach would likely have been most surprised to find that the exercise did not weaken the volunteers’ extremist views (as described in Option C).
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a series of lab experiments conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues at the University of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business.
  The researchers recruited a group of volunteers in their 30s who held various political affiliations.
  The volunteers were asked to state their positions on a variety of issues and rate their own understanding of said issues.
  The volunteers were then instructed to write elaborate explanations of two issues and explain the mechanics of those policies.
  The researchers found that requiring volunteers to engage in this kind of detailed explanation led them to moderate their views and become more aware of their own ignorance.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that these experiments produced a surprising finding in the results.
  We can eliminate options A and D because neither is explicitly mentioned, while B and C are discussed in the passage.
  Based on the passage, it seems that Fernbach's hypothesis was that the exercise of explaining complex policies in detail would force many to realize just how little they really knew about it, and thus dampen their enthusiasm.
  So, it would be reasonable to assume that Fernbach would have been most surprised by finding that the exercise did not increase the volunteers' understanding of the issue and had little effect on their views.
  Therefore, the answer is B: After volunteers were asked to analyze a complicated political issue, their understanding of it did not increase.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes a series of laboratory experiments conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues to explore whether forcing people to explain complex policies might force them to confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist views.
  A: The passage does not mention any link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers' positions.
  B: The passage does not mention whether the volunteers' understanding of the issue increased after they were asked to analyze it.
  C: The passage describes an experiment in which volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, and remained extreme in their passion for their positions.
  D: The passage does not suggest that those with the most extreme views had the best overall understanding.
Thought:
  The question asks which finding Fernbach would have been most surprised by.
  Throughout the passage, the author describes the various experiments conducted by Fernbach and his team, and how they contributed to the understanding of how people form their political beliefs and convictions.
  None of the options provided precisely answer the question of what would have been most surprising to Fernbach. 
  However, the passage describes that Fernbach believed that it is the slow, cognitive work, the deliberate analysis, that changes people's judgments, which he wanted to check in another experiment.
  Based on that, it is possible that B would have surprised him, as it contradicts his belief that cognitive work and deliberate analysis might change people's judgments. Alternatively, A could have surprised him since it counters the idea that complicated issues will prompt individuals to take stronger positions.
Criticism:
  It is not entirely clear from the passage what would have surprised Fernbach most as it does not explicitly state this.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the results of lab experiments conducted by Fernbach, a psychological scientist at the University of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business. Fernbach and his colleagues wanted to explore if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. Volunteers were recruited, asked to state their positions on a variety of issues and indicate how strongly they felt about each issue, and also rate their own understanding of the issues. They were then instructed to write elaborate explanations of two issues, which aimed at providing a highly detailed description of the mechanics of the policy in action.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses two different experiments conducted by Fernbach. One involved the volunteers explaining complex policies in detail, while the other involved the volunteers simply listing reasons for their positions. Thus, if Fernbach had been surprised by any finding, it would have been related to one of these experiments.
  The passage states that the exercise of explaining complex policies in detail forced many volunteers to realize just how little they really knew about the issue. The article goes on to say that this made them humbled and led to them taking less extreme positions. This suggests that Fernbach would not have been surprised by the result that the exercise helped dampen the volunteers' extreme stands on issues. Therefore Choice C is incorrect.
  The passage does not suggest that a link exists between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions. Therefore, Choice A is incorrect. 
  The article does not provide any evidence regarding changes in volunteers' understanding of a complex political issue after they were asked to analyze it. Therefore, Choice B is incorrect.
  As explained in the previous paragraph, the article states that when volunteers were forced to explain two complex issues, they realized how little they really knew about them. Therefore, Fernbach would not have been surprised by this finding, making Choice C the correct answer.
Criticism: N/A
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a series of lab experiments conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues to explore whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would force them to confront their ignorance and thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. 
  A: No information was given in the passage about a link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions.
  B: The passage suggests that volunteers had an inflated sense of understanding of complex policies before being asked to explain them in detail. However, it does not discuss whether their understanding actually increased after completing the exercise.
  C: The passage suggests that volunteers who listed their reasons for their positions remained extreme in their passion for their positions and thought they understood the policies in their complexity.
  D: The passage does not provide evidence to support the idea that those with the most extreme views had the best overall understanding of complex issues.
Thought:
  The passage discusses how Fernbach wanted to explore whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would force them to confront their ignorance and thus weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The passage outlines two experiments conducted by Fernbach: one where volunteers were asked to write elaborate explanations of two issues and another where some volunteers merely listed reasons for liking a policy.
  The passage suggests that the second experiment found that those who simply listed reasons for their positions remained extreme in their passion for their positions and did not question their understanding of complex policies.
  The passage does not discuss any findings that would contradict Fernbach's hypothesis or go against what he would expect to find.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that Fernbach would have been most surprised by any of the given options.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a study conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues to determine if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and thus weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The volunteers were asked to state their positions on a variety of issues, rate their own understanding of the issues, and then were instructed to write elaborate explanations of two issues without being asked for value judgments.
  The study found that when volunteers were asked to explain complex policies in detail, their extremist views were weakened and they became more moderate in their views.
Thought:
  Fernbach conducted a study to determine if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would weaken their extremist views.
  The study found that when volunteers explained complex policies in detail, their extremist views were weakened.
  Therefore, Fernbach would have been most surprised by the finding that listing reasons for endorsing a particular policy did not affect the volunteers' views.
  The answer is C: When volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
Criticism:
  The passage states that Fernbach and his colleagues conducted a study to determine if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would weaken their extremist views.
  The passage also states that the study found that when volunteers explained complex policies in detail, their extremist views were weakened.
  However, the passage does not mention that Fernbach would have been surprised by any particular finding from the study.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses experiments conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues to explore whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might weaken their extreme positions on issues.
  A: The passage does not mention any link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers' positions.
  B: The passage does not suggest that the volunteers' understanding of complicated political issues did not increase after they were asked to analyze them. 
  C: The passage implies that the exercise of asking volunteers to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy did not affect their views.
  D: The passage does not suggest that those with the most extreme views have the best overall understanding of complex issues.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that Fernbach and his colleagues conducted lab experiments to test how forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might weaken their extremist stands on issues. To answer the question, we should look for the finding that would most surprise Fernbach in this context.
  The passage mentions that explaining complex policies in detail, which involved elaborating on the mechanics of implementation, dampened the extreme views of the volunteers. So, it might have surprised Fernbach if this exercise did not weaken the volunteers' extremist positions. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: When volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("C").
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses an experiment conducted by Philip Fernbach and his colleagues.
  Fernbach wanted to explore whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  Volunteers were recruited to state their positions on various issues and rate their own understanding of them.
  Volunteers were then instructed to write elaborate explanations of two issues, focusing on the mechanics of implementation rather than value judgments.
  The experiment found that trying and failing to explain complex policies undermined extremists' illusions about being well-informed, and they became more moderate in their views as a result.
Thought:
  The passage discusses Fernbach's lab experiments and their results.
  The experiments were designed to explore whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The passage suggests that Fernbach's experiments produced positive results in this regard.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that Fernbach would have been most surprised by a finding that conflicted with this conclusion.
  This rules out choices B and D.
  The passage does suggest that people are often unaware of their own ignorance and seek out information that bolsters their views, which increases political extremism.
  Therefore, it is possible that Fernbach might have been surprised if the experiments had found that asking volunteers to list their reasons for endorsing a policy did not affect their views.
  However, the passage does not explicitly state that Fernbach would have been surprised by this finding.
  Therefore, it is difficult to eliminate choice C as a possible answer.
  Finally, the passage does not state that there was no link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers' positions.
  However, the passage suggests that the experiments were successful in weakening extremists' views on complex policies.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that Fernbach would have been most surprised by a finding that there was no link between complexity and the strength of positions.
  This eliminates choice A as a possible answer.
Conclusion:
  It is difficult to choose a single answer with certainty.
  However, the best answer choice may be C: when volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
  The passage suggests that the experiments were successful in weakening extremists' views on complex policies.
  Therefore, it is less likely that Fernbach would have been surprised by a finding that supported existing beliefs about the difficulty of changing people's minds.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  In the passage, Philip Fernbach and his colleagues conducted lab experiments with volunteers to test whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues. They had volunteers write elaborate explanations of two issues, asking them for a highly detailed description of the mechanics of the policy in action, without being asked for value judgments. The experiments found that being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a policy made many realize just how little they really knew about it, leading them to become more moderate in their views.
Thought: 
  Fernbach's experiments aimed to test the idea that explaining complex policies in detail might force people to confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues. 
  If Fernbach were most surprised by one of the findings, it would mean that it went against his expectations. 
  The passage mentions three findings that Fernbach might have found surprising, including:
    - No link was found between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions.
    - After volunteers were asked to analyze a complicated political issue, their understanding of it did not increase.
    - When volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
  The passage does not mention a finding that the volunteers with the most extreme views had the best overall understanding of complex issues.
  Therefore, the most surprising finding for Fernbach would be that after volunteers were asked to analyze a complicated political issue, their understanding of it did not increase (choice B).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses a laboratory experiment conducted by Philip Fernbach and colleagues.
- The experiment involved recruiting volunteers and asking them to state their positions on various issues.
- Volunteers were then asked to explain the mechanics of certain policies in a detailed manner.
- The goal of the experiment was to see if this process of explaining policies in detail would force volunteers to confront their ignorance and take less extreme positions.
Thought:
- The question is asking which finding would have surprised Fernbach the most.
- Option A, which suggests that the complexity of an issue did not affect the strength of the volunteers' positions, is not surprising based on the information given in the passage. There is no mention of a link between complexity and strength of position.
- Option B suggests that volunteers' understanding of complex political issues did not increase after analyzing them, which is not the main focus of the experiment presented in the passage. The main focus is on whether this process would force volunteers to take less extreme positions, not on whether their understanding of the issues would increase.
- Option C suggests that the exercise of listing reasons for endorsing a policy did not affect volunteers' views, which aligns with the idea that simply talking about one's views can strengthen them. This finding is not surprising based on the information given in the passage.
- Option D, which suggests that volunteers with the most extreme views had the best overall understanding of the complex issues, contradicts the main goal of the experiment presented in the passage, which is to force volunteers to confront their ignorance and take less extreme positions.
- Therefore, based on the information given in the passage, the most surprising finding to Fernbach would be option D.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.
Question: Based on the passage, which choice best identifies a contradictory impulse in Little Chandler’s character?
Choices:
  A: He fixates on a social world that he ultimately believes to be a hollow spectacle.
  B: He immerses himself in sights and sounds that strike him as ultimately frivolous.
  C: He scorns a historical era that he concedes is preferable in some ways to the present.
  D: He derives excitement from placing himself in settings he finds menacing.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage is about Little Chandler's thoughts as he reflects on his past and his present life.
  A: The passage mentions Little Chandler's admiration for the glamour of Gallaher's life in London, but it does not suggest that Little Chandler thinks of it as a "hollow spectacle."
  B: The passage describes Little Chandler's pleasure in observing the sunset and the people in the park, but it does not suggest that he finds them frivolous.
  C: The passage does not mention Little Chandler scorning a historical era. 
  D: The passage describes Little Chandler's fear of dark, deserted streets at night and his habit of quickly walking past them, but it does not suggest he derives excitement from such settings.
Thought:
  Little Chandler admires Gallaher's life in London, but he also feels sad about his own life and how he has not achieved the same level of success as Gallaher. 
  He enjoys observing the world around him, but he also feels a sense of melancholy when he thinks about the struggle of life.
  Therefore, both impulses, the admiration and the melancholy, are contradictory.
  But the question asks about a contradictory impulse that is specific to Little Chandler's character.
  Neither A nor B describes a contradictory impulse; instead, these choices exaggerate or misrepresent aspects of his character.
  C is not relevant to the passage.
  D could be seen as somewhat contradictory because Little Chandler both fears and seeks out the kind of settings he finds menacing.
Criticism:
  D is not fully accurate because the passage does not suggest that Little Chandler "seeks out" menacing settings, but rather that he sometimes "courts" the "causes of his fear" by walking down dark streets.
  However, D is still the closest answer to the question because it identifies a specific aspect of Little Chandler's character that is contradictory.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Little Chandler is a character in a story.
  He is meeting with Gallaher, a friend he has not seen in eight years.
  Chandler is a small man with refined manners, who takes care to look presentable and is often melancholy.
  He is walking through Dublin, reflecting on his present joy and his friend's success.
Thought:
  The passage does not provide much evidence of contradictory impulses in Little Chandler's character.
  However, one possible contradictory impulse is the fact that he enjoys walking through the city streets at night, even though he is afraid and apprehensive.
  He sometimes even seeks out dark and narrow streets, but then becomes troubled by the silence and the silent figures he encounters.
  This seems to be a contradiction between his attraction to fear and danger, and his fear itself.
  Therefore, the answer is D: He derives excitement from placing himself in settings he finds menacing.
Criticism:
  Your answer is an acceptable interpretation of Chandler's character, but it is not the only possible choice.
  Option A and option B could also be argued as contradictory impulses: Chandler fixates on a social world that he ultimately believes to be hollow and frivolous, yet he still desires to be part of it.
  Option C, on the other hand, is not a contradiction in itself, since it is possible to appreciate certain aspects of an era while still scolding it overall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage is about Little Chandler's thoughts and feelings.
  Little Chandler thinks about his friend, Ignatius Gallaher, with admiration.
  He feels sad about his own life and how he perceives himself as unsuccessful.
  Little Chandler is fixated on the idea of going to London and experiencing a different kind of life.
Thought:
  Little Chandler admires his friend who has become successful in London as a journalist.
  At the same time, Little Chandler feels sad about his own life and his lack of success.
  He often thinks of going to London to experience a different life and a sense of adventure.
  Therefore, Little Chandler's character is full of contradictory impulses; he is torn between admiring success and wanting to escape from his life.
  The best answer is not provided in the choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
    Little Chandler is a small man who is a friend of Gallaher.
    He is part of the King's Inn and is thinking about the changes that eight years have brought.
    He feels melancholic and useless to struggle against fortune.
    He has never been to Corless's but knows about the French and German speaking waiters.
    Chandler likes to read poetry, but he is too shy to read to his wife.
Thought: 
    While Chandler can be confident and decisive in many ways, he is also conflicted about what he values and how he should act.
    He is drawn to the glamor of Gallaher's lifestyle and the fanciful world of Corless's, but he is ultimately cynical about their worth.
    In contrast, he feels a nostalgic longing for the past, even though he knows the present is generally better. He is also too timid to share his interest in poetry with his wife.
    All of these feelings suggest a contradiction within Chandler's character.
    The best answer to the question is A: He fixates on a social world that he ultimately believes to be a hollow spectacle.
Criticism: 
    You are correct that Chandler seems conflicted about his values in several ways, but it is not clear that he is fully aware of the hollowness of the social world he admires.
    It might be more accurate to say that he has mixed feelings about the glamor and excitement of that world.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about Little Chandler, who is reflecting on his life and his friend, Gallaher, whom he had not seen in 8 years.
  A: The passage does describe Little Chandler's fascination with the social world of Gallaher and London but does not mention whether he ultimately believes it to be a hollow spectacle.
  B: The passage does describe Little Chandler as being immersed in the sights and sounds of the city, but it does not suggest that he finds them frivolous.
  C: The passage does not mention any historical era that Little Chandler scorns.
  D: The passage does mention Little Chandler's fear of certain menacing situations, such as walking down dark and narrow streets at night, but it does not suggest that he derives excitement from these experiences.
Thought: 
  The passage describes Little Chandler as being introspective and reflective, but it does not identify a contradictory impulse in his character specifically.
  None of the choices clearly match a contradictory impulse in Little Chandler's character.
  However, choice A comes closest as it mentions his fixation on a social world that he eventually sees as hollow, which could be seen as contradictory.
Criticism: 
  While choice A could be seen as contradictory, it is not clearly identified as such in the passage. It is also not clear whether Little Chandler ultimately believes the social world to be hollow.
  Furthermore, Little Chandler's thoughts do not suggest a clear contradictory impulse in his character, making this question difficult to answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Little Chandler is described as a refined, fastidious person who is easily saddened by the difficulties of life.
  He is excited to meet his successful friend, Ignatius Gallaher, in London.
  He is interested in high society and lavish experiences.
Thought: 
  The passage describes Little Chandler's interest in high society and lavish experiences, but it also portrays him as melancholic and sometimes anxious.
  These traits suggest a more introverted, contemplative side to his personality, which might contradict his desire for luxury and excitement.
  The other choices are not supported by the text.
  Therefore, A: He fixates on a social world that he ultimately believes to be a hollow spectacle is the best choice that identifies a contradictory impulse in Little Chandler's character.
Criticism: 
  The other choices might also contain some contradictory impulse in Little Chandler's character.
  However, none of them is as directly supported by the text as choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Little Chandler is a character from a story.
  The passage describes Little Chandler's thoughts and actions.
Thought:
  Little Chandler is shown to have contradictory impulses of wanting to immerse himself in the social world of the rich and famous, while also feeling a sense of sadness when reflecting on life as a whole. 
  He seems to be drawn to the atmosphere of Corless's, a restaurant that he has never been to, yet he thinks is of great value. 
  On the other hand, he feels sad when he thinks of the uselessness of struggling against fortune and the burden of wisdom which the ages have bequeathed to him. 
  These two impulses seem to contrast with each other, as he feels both drawn towards this hedonistic social scene, while also being burdened by the harsh reality of life. 
  Option B is close, but not entirely accurate, as Little Chandler does not immerse himself in the frivolous sights and sounds but is drawn towards them, while he continues to feel sad. 
  Therefore, the best answer is A: He fixates on a social world that he ultimately believes to be a hollow spectacle. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage depicts Little Chandler's thoughts about his friend Gallaher, his job, and his social aspirations.
  A: There is no indication that Little Chandler thinks the social world he fixates on is hollow. He is instead excited by the glamorous world that he imagines in his head.
  B: Little Chandler appears to immerse himself in sights and sounds that he considers to be meaningful and desirable, such as the golden sunset and the potential joys of going to a fancy restaurant in the city.
  C: There is no indication that Little Chandler scorns a historical era. He does not mention any particular time in history.
  D: Little Chandler does feel anxious and fearful when he walks through dark and narrow streets at night, but it is not clear that he derives a sense of excitement from this experience.
Thought:
  Little Chandler seems to have conflicting impulses towards life: on one hand, he longs for a grander and more glamorous existence, but on the other hand, he feels melancholic and powerless to change his circumstances. He is simultaneously drawn to the pleasures of fancy restaurants and glamorous ladies, yet also feels sad about the burden of wisdom that comes with knowledge. This contradiction reflects the tension between his dreams and his reality, and his desire to escape the mundanity of his life while also recognizing the futility of such desires.
Therefore, the best answer is A: He fixates on a social world that he ultimately believes to be a hollow spectacle.
Criticism:
  The answer seems to overstate Little Chandler's critique of the social world he longs for. Although he recognizes the sadness and melancholy inherent in life, there is no clear indication that he considers the world of fancy restaurants and glamorous ladies to be a "hollow spectacle". He seems genuinely excited by the idea of this world, even if he is also aware of its limitations.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage is about Little Chandler, who reminisces about a friend, Gallaher, who is now successful in London.
  Little Chandler is described as having a fragile frame, refined manners, small white hands, fair silken hair, and a quiet voice.
  He spends his time thinking about Gallaher, London, and changes over the past eight years.
  He is also described as feeling sad and melancholic when he thinks about life and fortune.
  He is aware of fancy restaurants and their reputations, though he has never been to Corless's.
Thought:
  Little Chandler seems fixated on the glamorous, wealthy, and successful lifestyle of his friend Gallaher and the bustling city of London.
  However, he is also described as feeling sad and defeated when he thinks about his own life and fortune.
  Therefore, Little Chandler seems to have a contradictory impulse between envy and disillusionment.
  A fits this pattern. Although Little Chandler fixates on Gallaher’s success and the glamorous social world in London, he finds life and fortune to be a burden and struggles with the futility of it all.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Little Chandler is a character in a passage.
  He has a friend named Gallaher who has become successful.
  Little Chandler is saddened by the thought of life.
  He remembers buying poetry books but was too shy to read them out to his wife.
  Little Chandler passes by Corless's, a famous oyster eatery.
  He finds himself in fear but sometimes pursues it.
Thought: 
  Little Chandler is a character with contrasting impulses.
  He is hesitant to act on his personal inclinations, yet fixated on what he perceives as elitist societal norms.
  He is preoccupied with both the past he idealizes and the present that disappoints him, leading to a sense of hopelessness.
  He is intrigued by the nightlife and high society but at times is apprehensive of it.
  Therefore, choice A suits his contradictory impulses best.
Criticism: 
  Choice B could also be a possible answer since Little Chandler comes across as both drawn to London's societal norms yet ultimately feels they are hollow.
  However, option B does not explicitly mention London's social world.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L. Cox-Foster et al., "A Metagenomic Survey of Microbes in Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder." @2007 by American Association for the Advancement of Science.The table above shows, for colonies with colony collapse disorder and for colonies without colony collapse disorder, the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together
Question: Based on data in the table, which of the four pathogens infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder?
Choices:
  A: $\mathrm{IAPV}$
  B: $\mathrm{KBV}$
  C: Nosema apis
  D: Nosema ceranae
Response 0:
Knowledge: The table provided gives the percent of honeybee colonies affected by four pathogens in two groups: colonies with colony collapse disorder and colonies without colony collapse disorder. We are looking for the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Thought: We should look for the highest number under "colonies without colony collapse disorder" in the table to determine which pathogen infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder.
A: IAPV infected 5% of colonies without colony collapse disorder.
B: KBV infected 48% of colonies without colony collapse disorder.
C: Nosema apis infected 0% of colonies without colony collapse disorder.
D: Nosema ceranae is listed as infecting all four pathogens, so we cannot determine the percentage from this table.
The correct answer is B: $\mathrm{KBV}$.
Criticism: There is no criticism to make about the given answer, as it is correctly assessed. However, it's worth noting that the data provided may not be comprehensive enough to make legitimate assumptions or conclusions. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The table shows the percentage of colonies infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together. 
  A: IAPV is a virus.
  B: KBV is a virus.
  C: Nosema apis is a fungus.
  D: Nosema ceranae is both a fungus and a virus.
Thought: 
  The table shows that the percentage of colonies affected by each pathogen for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  From the table, the highest percentage is 81% infected by fungi. 
  Nosema apis is a fungus, but it has the lowest percentage of colonies infected compared to fungi and viruses. 
  Therefore, the answer is Fungi.
  Answer("Fungi")
Criticism: 
  Your logic and reasoning are correct, and you have identified that fungi are responsible for infecting the highest number of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  However, it is more accurate to specify that the answer is "Fungi (81%)", rather than just "Fungi".
  Action: Answer("Fungi (81%)")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The table lists the percentage of honey bee colonies infected with each of the four pathogens. It also shows separate percentages for colonies with and without colony collapse disorder. 
A: IAPV is a virus that infects honey bee colonies. 
B: KBV is a virus that infects honey bee colonies. 
C: Nosema apis is a fungus that infects honey bee colonies. 
D: Nosema ceranae is a fungus that infects honey bee colonies and causes nosema disease. 
Thought: The question asks which pathogen infected the highest percentage of honey bee colonies without colony collapse disorder. 
Looking at the table, the pathogen with the highest percentage of infection in colonies without colony collapse disorder is Nosema apis, with 0% of the colonies infected with this fungus. 
Therefore, the answer is C: Nosema apis. 
Criticism: 
    There are no flaws in the facts, logic, and reasoning used to arrive at the answer. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The table shows the percentage of colonies with honey bees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together for colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
Thought: 
  The percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder that are infected with each pathogen are: 
  IAPV = 5%
  KBV = 48%
  Nosema apis = 0%
  Nosema ceranae = none specified
  Therefore, the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder is KBV.
  The answer is B: KBV.
Criticism:
  You are correct that the data shows that KBV infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder. 
  However, the data does not provide information about Nosema ceranae, so it cannot be stated whether or not this pathogen infected any of the honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder. It is unclear if this is a possible answer choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The table shows the percent of honeybee colonies infected with each of four pathogens with or without colony collapse disorder (CCD). 
  A: IAPV is one of the four pathogens in the table that infect honeybee colonies with and without CCD. 
  B: KBV is one of the four pathogens in the table that infect honeybee colonies with and without CCD. 
  C: Nosema apis is one of the four pathogens listed in the table. 
  D: Nosema ceranae is one of the four pathogens listed in the table. 
Thought: 
  We need to find which of the four pathogens infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without CCD, looking only at the "Colonies without colony collapse disorder" column in the table.
  From the table, we see that the percent of colonies without CCD infected by each of the four pathogens are:
    - IAPV: 5%
    - KBV: 48%
    - Nosema apis: 0%
    - Nosema ceranae: 
      - "All four pathogens", but the table doesn't provide the specific percentage of colonies infected with Nosema ceranae only.
      - Since we're looking for the highest percentage of colonies infected, we cannot consider a pathogen for which we don't have the specific percentage. Therefore, we cannot consider Nosema ceranae in this question.
  Therefore, the pathogen with the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without CCD is KBV, with 48%. 
  The answer is B: KBV.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. There is no flaw in your reasoning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The table shows the percentage of honeybee colonies infected with each of four pathogens (Viruses, IAPV, KBV, Nosema apis) and with all four pathogens in both colonies with and without colony collapse disorder (CCD). 
  A: IAPV is one of the four pathogens listed in the table.
  B: KBV is one of the four pathogens listed in the table.
  C: Nosema apis is one of the four pathogens listed in the table.
  D: Nosema ceranae is one of the four pathogens listed in the table.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without CCD, based on the data in the table.
  The relevant data is in the second column, which shows the percentage of colonies without CCD affected by each pathogen.
  The percentage listed for IAPV is 5%, the percentage for KBV is 48%, the percentage for Nosema apis is 0%, and the percentage for Nosema ceranae is not given.
  Therefore, KBV infected the highest percentage of honey bee colonies without CCD based on the data in the table.
  The answer is B: KBV.
Criticism: 
  There are no major flaws in this reasoning. However, it is important to note that this table only shows one set of data and does not necessarily reflect the average or true prevalence of these pathogens among honeybee colonies.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The table shows the percent of honeybee colonies affected by each pathogen.
  We are looking for the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Thought: 
  We need to look at the table and find the highest percentage value for each pathogen where there is no colony collapse disorder.
  For IAPV, the percentage value is 5.
  For KBV, the percentage value is 48, which is the highest percentage value.
  For Nosema apis, the percentage value is 0.
  For Nosema ceranae, the percentage value is not given for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  Therefore, the answer is B: KBV, as it infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The table shows the percent of honeybee colonies infected with each of the four pathogens.
  The question asks which pathogen infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Thought:
  Look for the pathogen with the highest percentage of infected colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  From the table, IAPV and KBV are both higher for colonies with colony collapse disorder, so they can be eliminated from the choices.
  Nosema apis infected 0% of colonies without colony collapse disorder, so it is not the answer.
  The only option left is Nosema ceranae, which infected "All four pathogens" in colonies with colony collapse disorder, but infected 81% of colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Nosema ceranae.
Criticism:
  There is no flaw in the logic in this case.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The table shows the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by four different pathogens and by all four pathogens together.
  A: IAPV is a virus.
  B: KBV is a virus.
  C: Nosema apis is a fungus.
  D: Nosema ceranae is a fungus that can infect bees and is known to cause colony collapse disorder.
Thought:
  The question asks which pathogen infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  Looking at the table, we can see that the highest percentage for honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder in the 'Virus' row is 5%, which is much lower than the percentages for any of the other pathogens.
  For fungi, Nosema apis infected 81% of colonies without CCD, which is higher than the percentages for any of the other fungi and the viruses.
  Therefore, the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder is Nosema apis.
  The answer is C: Nosema apis.
Criticism:
  Your logic and reasoning are correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The table shows the percentage of colonies with honey bees infected by each of four pathogens, including viruses and fungi.
Thought: We are looking for the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder. From the table, we can see that for each pathogen, the percentage of colonies affected is higher for colonies with colony collapse disorder. We need to look at the percentage of colonies without colony collapse disorder for each pathogen. 
Viruses infected 5% of colonies without colony collapse disorder.
IAPV infected 76% of colonies without colony collapse disorder.
KBV infected 48% of colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Nosema apis infected 0% of colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Nosema ceranae is not listed as its occurrence is only reported for all four pathogens combined.
Therefore, the answer is A: IAPV, which is the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: A pair of recent studies suggests that although.industrialized nations may have benefitted from larger.cities, the same is not true for the rapidly urbanizing areas of.the developing world. In these parts of the globe, there really.might be such a thing as too much urbanization, too.quickly..The studies, by Susanne A. Frick and Andrés Rodríguez-.Pose of the London School of Economics, take a close look.at the actual connection between city size and nationwide.economic performance. Their initial study, from last year,.examines the relationship between economic development,.as measured by GDP per capita, and average metropolitan-.area size in 114 countries across the world between 1960.and 2010. To ensure robustness, it controls for variables.including national population size, physical land area,.education levels, economic openness, and other factors..The size of cities or metro areas across the world has.exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the.developing world growing much faster and much larger.than those in more developed nations. Between 1960 and 2010, the median city in high-income countries grew.modestly from 500,000 to 650,000 people; but the median.city in the developing world nearly quadrupled, expanding.from 220,000 to 845,000 people. In 1960, 12 of the top 20.countries with the largest average city size were high-.income countries; by 2010, 14 of the top 20 were in the.developing world..Urbanization has historically been thought of as a.necessary feature of economic development and growth, but.this study finds the connection is not so simple. While.advanced nations benefit from having larger cities,.developing nations do not. Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every.additional 100,000 in average population among its large.cities over a five-year period. But for developing nations, the.addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year.period..In their latest study, the researchers found that.developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck.from smaller and medium-size cities. These countries see.the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion.of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people.or less. Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic.impact in larger countries. Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic.benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million.or more, according to the study. This makes sense:.Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play.host to knowledge-based industries that require urban.agglomeration economies..There are several reasons why megacities^1 often fail to.spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world..For one, the lion’s share of places that are urbanizing.most rapidly today are in the poorest and least-.developed parts of the world, whereas the places that.urbanized a century or so ago were in the richest and.most developed. This history has created a false.expectation that urbanization is always associated with.prosperity..Additionally, globalization has severed the historical.connection between cities, local agriculture, and local.industry that powered the more balanced urban.economic development of the past. In today’s globally.interconnected economy, the raw materials that flowed.from the surrounding countryside to the city can all be.inexpensively imported from other parts of the world..The result is that the connection between large cities and.growth has now become much more tenuous, producing.a troubling new pattern of “urbanization without.growth.”.The researchers used multiple variables to calculate a weighted average.city size for each country studied and reported the median of those.averages..(^1) Typically defined as cities with populations of over ten million people
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred from the passagethat a megacity’s economic impact on a country is
Choices:
  A: greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
  B: dependent on the types of companies located in the megacity.
  C: relatively equal for developing countries and high-income countries.
  D: neutralized by the economic cost of maintaining a megacity.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the relationship between city size and nationwide economic performance.
  It notes that industrialized nations have benefitted from larger cities, while the same is not necessarily true for rapidly urbanizing areas of the developing world.
  The size of cities or metro areas across the world has exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the developing world growing much faster and much larger than those in more developed nations.
  Urbanization has historically been thought of as a necessary feature of economic development and growth.
  The passage notes that bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries, whereas developing nations tend to benefit more from smaller and medium-sized cities.
Thought:
  Megacities often fail to spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world.
  The lion’s share of places that are urbanizing most rapidly today are in the poorest and least-developed parts of the world, which makes urbanization less likely to be associated with prosperity.
  The connection between large cities and growth has become much more tenuous, producing a troubling new pattern of “urbanization without growth”.
  The result is that a megacity’s economic impact on a country depends on other factors beyond city size and is likely greater in countries with larger physical land areas and/or certain types of companies.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that B: the economic impact of a megacity on a country is dependent on the types of companies located in the megacity. 
Criticism: 
  The passage does suggest that the types of companies located in the megacity may have an impact on economic growth, but it also notes that bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries, whereas developing nations tend to benefit more from smaller and medium-sized cities.
  Therefore, it is possible that A: a megacity’s economic impact on a country is greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
  D: neutralized by the economic cost of maintaining a megacity is not well-supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses two studies that look at the connection between city size and nationwide economic performance. 
  Developing countries have seen explosive urbanization in recent years, with cities in the developing world growing much faster and much larger than those in more developed nations.
  Advanced nations benefit from having larger cities, seeing a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every additional 100,000 in average population among its large cities over a five-year period.
  However, for developing nations, the addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year period. 
  Developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck from smaller and medium-size cities.
Thought:
  The passage does not suggest that a megacity's economic impact on a country is dependent on the physical land area of that country; in fact, it states that having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more. Therefore, A is incorrect.
  The passage notes that knowledge-based industries require urban agglomeration economies, suggesting that the types of companies located in a megacity could impact its economic impact on a country. Therefore, B is a possibility, but there is not enough information in the passage to definitively select this answer.
  The passage explicitly highlights that the connection between large cities and growth has become much more tenuous in recent years, producing a pattern of "urbanization without growth." This suggests that a megacity's economic impact on a country is not relatively equal for developing countries and high-income countries. Therefore, C is incorrect.
  The passage does not suggest that the economic cost of maintaining a megacity neutralizes its economic impact on a country. Therefore, D is incorrect.
  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is difficult to select a definitive answer to this question.
Criticism:
  Upon rereading the question stem, it is possible that the phrase "megacity's economic impact" is not specific enough to differentiate between high-income countries and developing nations. Therefore, it is possible that the answer could be C, as it states that the economic impact of large cities is relatively equal between developing countries and high-income countries. However, the passage does differentiate between the economic impact of large cities on developing nations versus advanced nations.
Action: Answer("B") or Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The article notes that the connection between large cities and economic growth is more tenuous in today's global economy, producing a pattern of "urbanization without growth" in many rapidly urbanizing areas of the developing world.
  The article mentions that for advanced nations, larger cities positively impact economic growth, but that for developing nations, the addition of people to large cities is associated with a decrease in economic growth.
  The article notes that megacities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries.
Thought:
  A megacity is a city with more than 10 million inhabitants.
  According to the article, bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries.
  This implies that megacities are likely to have a greater economic impact in larger countries.
  Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that a megacity's economic impact on a country is greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
  The correct answer, therefore, is A: greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
Criticism:
  It may be possible that larger physical land areas are not the only factor that results in a megacity having a greater economic impact on a country. Other factors, such as the size of the country's population, may also play a role.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the impact of city size on a country's economic performance.
  The median size of cities has grown much faster in developing countries than in high-income countries between 1960 and 2010.
  The connection between city size and economic performance is not straightforward.
  According to the passage, for advanced nations, larger cities have positive impacts on economic growth, while for developing nations, larger cities have negative impacts on economic growth.
  The passage also notes that smaller and medium-size cities have a bigger impact on economic growth in developing countries.
  The passage does not discuss the relationship between a megacity's economic impact and a country's physical land area nor the economic cost of maintaining a megacity.
Thought:
  The passage notes that a megacity's economic impact may be positive or negative depending on the country's level of development.
  The passage also notes that a larger proportion of the urban population living in smaller and medium-size cities benefits economic growth in developing countries.
  The passage does not connect the impact of megacity with land area or the economic cost of maintaining a megacity.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the types of companies located in the megacity may be the most significant factor for determining the economic impact of a megacity on a country.
  Option B is the best answer.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The researchers found that adding 100,000 people in large cities in developing countries is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year period. 
  Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every additional 100,000 in average population among its large cities over a five-year period.
  Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more. 
Thought:
  The passage discusses the relationship between city size and nationwide economic performance in the developing world and the types of cities that produce the most economic benefit for a country.
  The passage implies that a megacity's economic impact on a country is dependent on its population size relative to the total urban population of the country.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the answer is not A, which suggests that a megacity's economic impact is greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
  Similarly, the answer is not D, which suggests that a megacity's economic impact is neutralized by the economic cost of maintaining a megacity.
  The passage does not provide any information on whether a megacity's economic impact depends on the types of companies located in the megacity, so the answer is not B.
  Therefore, the most reasonable answer is C, which suggests that a megacity's economic impact is relatively equal for developing countries and high-income countries.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly mention whether a megacity's economic impact is relatively equal for developing countries and high-income countries.
  Therefore, the answer is not definitive.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a pair of studies by Susanne A. Frick and Andrés Rodríguez-Pose that investigate the relationship between city size and nationwide economic performance.
  The studies examine 114 countries across the world between 1960 and 2010 and control for various variables including physical land area, education levels, economic openness, and more.
  The median city in the developing world nearly quadrupled in size from 220,000 to 845,000 people between 1960 and 2010.
  For advanced nations, having larger cities benefits economic growth, but for developing nations, an additional 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year period.
  In developing nations, smaller and medium-size cities tend to yield greater economic benefits.
  The raw materials necessary for cities in the past can be imported from other parts of the world due to globalization, making the connection between large cities and growth tenuous in some cases.
Thought: 
  The passage explains that megacities can have a different economic impact on a country depending on certain factors.
  The passage does not mention that megacities' economic impact is greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
  The passage does mention that the impact of a megacity on a country is dependent on the types of companies located in the megacity, which suggests that this choice may be correct.
  The passage also indicates that the economic benefits of larger cities are greater in advanced nations, while smaller and medium-size cities produce greater economic benefits in developing nations.
  The passage does not suggest that the economic cost of maintaining a megacity neutralizes its economic impact on a country.
  Thus, choice B is the most reasonable inference.
Criticism: 
  The passage does suggest that the economic benefits of larger cities are greater in larger countries, but it does not suggest that the economic impact of megacities is greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
  While the passage indicates that the types of companies located in megacities influence their economic impact, it is unclear whether this factor is the most significant one.
  Nevertheless, there is no indication in the passage that either choice A or choice C is a more reasonable inference than choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the relationship between city size and nationwide economic performance.
  The size of cities or metro areas across the world has exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the developing world growing much faster and much larger than those in more developed nations. 
  Advanced nations benefit from having larger cities, but developing nations do not. 
  Urbanization has historically been thought of as a necessary feature of economic development and growth, but this study finds the connection is not so simple.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the economic impact of megacities on countries.
  The passage states that the connection between large cities and growth has become more tenuous, producing a troubling new pattern of “urbanization without growth.”
  The research found that developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck from smaller and medium-size cities, while bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that a megacity's economic impact on a country is dependent on the type of country it is located in, and is not equal for developing countries and high-income countries.
  However, the passage does not provide information to support options A, B or D.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses two recent studies on the connection between city size and nationwide economic performance.
  The size of cities has grown rapidly in developing nations and has historically been considered necessary for economic development.
  However, the connection between city size and economic growth is not so simple, and the studies suggest that developing nations may benefit more from smaller and medium-sized cities.
  The economic impact of megacities is discussed, and it is suggested that their impact may be more positive in larger, more developed countries.
Thought:
  The article suggests that the economic impact of megacities is not universal and depends on various factors.
  The passage also mentions that the connection between large cities and economic growth has become more tenuous.
  It is suggested that megacities may have a more positive impact in larger, more developed countries with knowledge-based industries.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that a megacity's economic impact on a country is dependent on various factors, such as the country's level of development and the type of industry present in the megacity.
  The answer is B: dependent on the types of companies located in the megacity.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the connection between city size and economic performance in developing and industrialized nations.
- The researchers found that the relationship between city size and economic performance is not consistent across all countries and regions.
- The passage states that bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries, and that having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more.
Thought:
- The passage suggests that a megacity's economic impact on a country is not consistent across all countries and regions.
- The passage notes that bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries, but it also mentions that the relationship between city size and economic performance is more tenuous in the globalized economy.
- The passage does not suggest that the economic impact of a megacity is neutralized by the costs of maintaining it. 
- The passage does not provide any information to suggest that a megacity's economic impact is dependent on the types of companies located in the megacity.
- The passage does not provide any information to suggest that a megacity's economic impact is greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
- Based on the information provided, it can be reasonably inferred that a megacity's economic impact on a country may depend on the total urban population of the country in question.
- Therefore, the answer is not explicitly stated in the passage, but the best choice is likely B: dependent on the types of companies located in the megacity. 
Criticism:
- Based on the information provided in the passage, it is possible that the correct answer could be A or C, as bigger cities may have a more positive economic impact in larger countries, and the economic impact of megacities in high-income and developing countries is different according to the passage.
- However, since the passage suggests that there are multiple factors that contribute to a megacity's economic impact, and that the connection between city size and economic performance is not straightforward, it is reasonable to infer that the answer is more likely to be B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The article discusses the relationship between city size and economic performance.
- Larger cities in advanced nations are associated with economic growth, but the same is not true for developing nations.
- Developing nations see the most economic benefit from smaller and medium-size cities.
- Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more.
Thought:
- The article suggests that the economic impact of a megacity on a country is not the same across all countries.
- According to the article, the connection between city size and economic growth is not straightforward and depends on several factors.
- One of the factors mentioned is the total urban population of a country.
- Therefore, it can be inferred that a megacity's economic impact on a country depends on the size of the total urban population of that country.
- None of the options mention the size of the total urban population, so none of them appear to be the correct answer.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

Question: An unstated assumption made by the authors about clover is that the plants
Choices:
  A: do not produce pyrethrums.
  B: are members of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  C: are usually located near wild-type honeybee colonies.
  D: will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The passage mentions that pyrethrums are produced by a group of flowering plants that includes Chrysanthemum species and are potent insecticides with anti-mite activity.
- The passage suggests that the colonies fed with monocrops are probably deficient in anti-mite toxins like pyrethrums.
- The proposed experiment in the passage is aimed at comparing the effects of feeding honeybee colonies with clover only versus feeding them with clover and pyrethrum plants.
Thought:
- Clover is mentioned as an example of a typical bee food source but there is no evidence to suppose that it produces pyrethrums.
- The passage also does not suggest that clover is a member of the Chrysanthemum genus.
- There is no mention in the passage that clover is usually located near wild-type honeybee colonies but it is mentioned as an example of a typical bee food source.
- The passage does not suggest that clover will not be a good food source for honeybees in control colonies.
- Therefore, the answer must be A: do not produce pyrethrums.
Criticism:
- There is no clear evidence or statement in the passage that explicitly assumes that clover does not produce pyrethrums.
- The passage clearly identifies other plants that produce pyrethrums but not clover. The absence of an explicit statement does not necessarily mean that it is an unstated assumption.
- However, given the information provided, we can reasonably infer that clover does not produce pyrethrums.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the link between bee nutrition, mite infestations, and colony collapse disorder.
  The authors suspect that commercial bee colonies are deficient in anti-mite toxins and nutrients, such as pyrethrums. 
  Pyrethrums are potent insecticides found in Chrysanthemum plants and their synthetic analogues are known as pyrethroids.
  The authors propose testing the effectiveness of pyrethrum-producing plants as a natural defense against mite infestations.
  The article does not mention any specific characteristics or benefits of clover.
Thought: 
  The article states that commercial bee colonies are deficient in anti-mite toxins, such as pyrethrums, and nutrients. 
  There is no evidence to suggest that clovers produce anti-mite toxins or that they are members of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  The article suggests that clover is a typical food source for bees, which implies that it is a suitable food for them to consume.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that the authors assumed that clover would not be a good food source for honeybees.
  Thus, option D can be eliminated.
  However, there is no evidence to support that clovers do produce pyrethrums either.
  Therefore, the authors most likely assumed that clovers do not produce pyrethrums.
  Thus, the answer is A: do not produce pyrethrums.
Criticism: 
  There is no clear statement in the article that explicitly mentions clover not producing pyrethrums.
  However, the authors discuss pyrethrums as potent insecticides found in specific flowering plants, such as Chrysanthemums.
  There is no mention of clovers possessing such insecticides or anti-mite properties.
  The assumption that clovers do not produce pyrethrums is implicit in the context of the article's focus on the effectiveness of pyrethrum-producing plants for mite control.
  Therefore, the answer choice A is the most reasonable assumption based on the available information.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how pyrethrums can help protect bees from Varroa mites and other pathogens.
  The authors suggest that the bees in commercial colonies may be nutritionally deficient and lacking in anti-mite toxins, such as pyrethrums.
  The authors propose that a trial could be conducted to investigate the efficacy of pyrethrums in protecting bees from mite infestations.
Thought: 
  The authors mention that the control colonies will be given clover as a typical food source.
  However, there is no mention in the passage that clover produces pyrethrums or has any particular anti-mite activity.
  Therefore, it is likely that the authors assume that clover does not contain pyrethrums or any other anti-mite toxins.
  The assumption made by the authors about clover is that it does not produce pyrethrums or have any particular anti-mite activity.
  The answer is A: do not produce pyrethrums.
Criticism: 
  The passage clearly states that pyrethrums are produced by plants such as Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species.
  There is no mention in the passage that clover is a member of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  The passage does not suggest any particular relationship between clover and wild-type honeybee colonies.
  The passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that clover will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The article hypothesizes that a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins such as pyrethrums may make bee colonies more susceptible to mite infestations.
  The article suggests that a trial could be conducted to test whether pyrethrum-producing plants have a positive effect on bee colonies infected with mites.
  The article suggests that bees may seek out or avoid pyrethrum-containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the amount already consumed by the bees.
Thought:
  The article mentions that the control colonies will be offered a typical bee food source such as clover.
  The article postulates that the commercially produced food may be nutritionally deficient and lack anti-mite toxins such as pyrethrums.
  However, the article does not state that clover produces pyrethrums or is a member of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  Therefore, the assumption made about clover is that it will provide adequate nutrition for honeybees and is not a pyrethrum-producing plant.
  The answer is D: will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
Criticism: 
  The article did not mention that clover is not a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
  However, the authors did mention that honeybees in commercial colonies fed on mono-crops may be nutritionally deficient.
  This implies that honeybees require a diverse diet to get the required nutrients.
  Therefore, it's possible that clover alone may not provide the required nutrients and anti-mite toxins.
  So, the assumption made about clover is that it may not be an adequate food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
  The most likely answer is D: will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the potential nutritional deficiencies of bees in commercial colonies that are fed monocrops, and suggests that this may include a deficiency in anti-mite toxins like pyrethrums. The authors propose a study in which some colonies are offered pyrethrum-producing plants in addition to a typical food source like clover, while the control group is only offered clover. 

Thought: The passage does not provide any information to support option B or C. Option D is not a stated assumption made by the authors; the passage only suggests that clover is a typical food source for bees, but does not say whether it is a good or bad food source. The only logical assumption that can be made based on the information provided is that clover (option A) does not produce pyrethrums, since the authors propose offering pyrethrum-producing plants in addition to clover to test the hypothesis that a deficiency in anti-mite toxins may be a cause of bee colony collapse. 

Criticism: It is possible that the authors may have made other assumptions about clover that are not stated in the passage, but based solely on the information provided, option A is the most likely assumption.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The authors mention clover as a typical bee food source.
  Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species.
Thought:
  The authors suggest that the bees of commercial bee colonies may be nutritionally deficient due to a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in pyrethrum-producing plants.
  The authors also mention clover as a typical bee food source but do not directly link it to pyrethrums or other anti-mite toxins.
  Therefore, it is not stated or implied that clover plants produce pyrethrums or other anti-mite toxins.
  There is no reason to believe that clover is not a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
  Thus, none of the options is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the role of pyrethrums produced by specific Chrysanthemum plants in preventing Varroa mites infestation in honey bee colonies.
  Clover is mentioned as a typical bee food source.
Thought:
  The article mentions pyrethrums produced by specific Chrysanthemum plants as a toxin that can help prevent mite infestations in honeybee colonies.
  Clover is mentioned as a typical bee food source that may be nutritionally deficient in pyrethrums and other nutrients necessary to prevent mite infestation.
  Therefore, the authors assume that clover is unlikely to contain significant amounts of pyrethrums.
  The answer is A: do not produce pyrethrums.
Criticism:
  There is no direct statement in the article that clover does not produce pyrethrums.
  However, the article provides evidence that specific Chrysanthemum plants produce pyrethrums, and clover is not mentioned as one of them. 
  In addition, the article suggests that honeybee colonies that are not fed with pyrethrum-producing plants are more susceptible to mite infestations and can become deficient in nutrients necessary to prevent mite infestation. Therefore, it can also be assumed that clover is not a good source of pyrethrums.
  Hence, A: do not produce pyrethrums, is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the potential benefits of pyrethrum-producing plants in preventing mite infestations in honeybee colonies. The authors suggest that honeybees may be able to self-regulate their consumption of pyrethrum-containing plants to prevent mite infestations.
Thought: The passage mentions clover as a typical food source for honeybees. The authors suggest that the lack of pyrethrums in the diet of commercial honeybee colonies may contribute to their susceptibility to mite infestations. However, the passage does not explicitly state that clover does not produce pyrethrums, and there is no reason to believe that clover belongs to the Chrysanthemum genus. Additionally, the passage does not mention the location of clover near wild-type honeybee colonies. Finally, the passage does not suggest that clover is an inadequate food source for honeybees, but rather that it may not provide adequate protection against mite infestations without the additional benefits of pyrethrums.
Criticism: None
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the role of pyrethrums in protecting bees from Varroa mite infections.
  The study proposed in the passage involves testing the use of pyrethrum-producing plants as a supplement to the diet of commercial honeybee colonies.
  Clover is mentioned as a typical bee food source that might be used as a control in the proposed study.
Thought:
  The passage does not provide any information to suggest that clover produces pyrethrums.
  The passage does not suggest that clover is related to the Chrysanthemum genus.
  The passage does not suggest that the location of clover is related to wild-type honeybee colonies.
  The passage does not suggest that clover will be a less effective food source compared to the pyrethrum-producing plants.
  Therefore, there is no unstated assumption made by the authors about clover.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses that pyrethrums, which are produced by Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, and Chrysanthemum marschalli, can serve as anti-mite toxins for honey bees.
  The article suggests that commercial bee colonies may be deficient in anti-mite toxins and nutrients found in plants, including pyrethrums.
  The article proposes a trial where commercial honey bee colonies are given access to pyrethrum producing plants as well as a typical bee food source such as clover.
Thought: 
  The article proposes using typical bee food sources such as clover for the control colonies.
  The authors do not suggest that clover produces pyrethrums, but rather it is not discussed.
  Therefore, assuming that the control colonies will not have access to pyrethrums, the authors likely consider clover to be a good food source for honeybees.
  Thus, it has to be assumed that choice D will not be true.
  The correct answer is D: will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the article that the authors consider clover a “good” food source for honeybees. They only suggest it as a typical food source.
  Therefore, it is problematic to make assumptions about its efficacy in feeding honeybees in this context.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.
Question: done") The narrator indicates that he pays Sempere
Choices:
  A: less than Sempere expects him to pay for the books.
  B: nothing, because Sempere won't take his money.
  C: the money he makes selling sweets to the other children.
  D: much less for the books than they are worth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:

  The bookseller does not often allow the narrator to pay for the books when he takes them.
Thought: 
  The narrator doesn't have much money, but he loves books.
  The bookseller at Sempere & Sons is kind and allows him to read books for free.
  The narrator is persuaded to leave money on the counter for the bookseller to take.
  Therefore, the narrator pays Sempere sometimes but not often.
  The answer is A: less than Sempere expects him to pay for the books.
Criticism: 
  Your thoughts are correct. The narrator doesn't have much money for books but he wants to read them. Sempere allows him to read for free. Therefore, the narrator leaves money on the counter for Sempere to take, but it is not often and not much. 
  So the answer is A: less than Sempere expects him to pay for the books.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The narrator receives money from his father occasionally.
  The narrator collects this money in a coffee tin and saves enough to buy himself a book.
  The narrator frequents Sempere & Sons bookshop, where the owner lets him read books for free.

The narrator thinks that Sempere expects him to pay for the books, but he leaves coins on the counter when the bookseller is not looking. 
Therefore, the narrator indicates that he pays Sempere less than he expects him to pay for the books. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The narrator frequents Sempere & Sons bookshop.
  He is allowed to read any book he likes to his heart's content.
  The bookseller hardly ever allowed him to pay for the books, but when he wasn't looking, he'd leave the coins he'd managed to collect on the counter before he left.
  He only collects small change and probably can not afford to buy the books with it.
Thought: 
  The narrator wants to read books but his father does not let him.
  He frequents Sempere & Sons bookshop and reads books there.
  Whenever possible, he leaves a small amount of coins for the books, but it seems like he can't afford to buy the books.
  This means that the narrator is paying Sempere something for the books he reads.
  Option B seems to be correct that Sempere won't take his money, but option D is also true as he can't even afford to buy a book with the small change he collects.
  Option D puts emphasis on the value of the books, while option B emphasizes the kindness of the bookseller. 
  Based on the context and information given, it seems like Option D is a more likely answer to the question.
  Therefore, the answer is D: much less for the books than they are worth.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."
Question: What can reasonably be inferred about the reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study?
Choices:
  A: The ibises were well acquainted with their migration route.
  B: Usherwood knew the ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration.
  C: The ibises have a body design that is similar to that of a modern airplane.

Thought: 
  The northern bald ibises were selected for this study.
  The passage explains that the study was done to test how birds fly in a V formation.
  There is no information to suggest why the ibises were chosen and not another type of bird.
  It is reasonable to assume that northern bald ibises were used because they were available and/or suitable for the research project.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide any information about why Usherwood and his team used northern bald ibises specifically.
  Therefore, any inference about the reason for choosing northern bald ibises would be speculative at best.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The study observed the flight of northern bald ibises to investigate why birds fly in a V formation.
  The study took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises to Europe.
  The researchers used data loggers to track the flight of the ibises and determine their wing flapping timing.
Thought: 
  Usherwood and his team likely chose the ibises as subjects of their study because they were already working with them for another project aimed at breeding.
  The ibises were a convenient species to use for the study as they were well-known to the team and relatively easy to track and observe.
  The ibises are particularly useful for such a study because they are large, long-winged birds that are likely to fly in a V formation.
  Therefore, the reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study is likely because they were easily accessible for him and his team to track and observe.
  The answer is D: The ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that Usherwood and his team likely chose the ibises because they were already working with them for another project aimed at breeding. 
  However, the term "easily accessible" may be an overstatement, as the northern bald ibis is a critically endangered species, and therefore it might not be so easy to find a sufficient number of birds for a study.
  A better answer might be A: The ibises were well acquainted with their migration route, as the study took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce the species to Europe, and the birds were already accustomed to flying a particular migration route. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The study was conducted using northern bald ibises.
  The scientists used a microlight plane to show the birds their ancestral migration route.
  The birds were carrying data loggers that were specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
Thought:
  Usherwood and his team used northern bald ibises as their subjects for the study.
  The reason for using them was likely because they are a migratory bird species.
  The birds were raised in captivity, making it easier for the scientists to attach the data loggers.
  The scientists used a microlight plane to show the birds their migration route, hinting at the fact that the birds may not have been well acquainted with it.
  The ibises were a convenient choice for the research team.
  Therefore, the most reasonable inference is D: The ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.
Criticism:
  It is possible that the ibises were chosen for other reasons that are not mentioned in the text. 
  For instance, the ibises could have a similar body design with that of a modern airplane, or they could be an endangered species that the team wanted to study.
  Therefore, while option D is the most reasonable inference, there could be more reasons for using the ibises.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The study was conducted on northern bald ibises.
  The ibises were hand-raised birds that were taught to follow their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy.
  A microlight plane was used to fly alongside the birds to capture data about their flight patterns.
  The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings because such measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species.
Thought:
  Usherwood conducted the study on northern bald ibises.
  The ibises were hand-raised and were taught to follow their migration route.
  The researchers used a microlight plane to capture data about the bird's flight patterns.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie's eyes. Finally, she spoke.90 "I met him at my literary meeting."Naomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped."Mother.""Yes?"95 "I mean to have him."\begin{itemize}\item a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name\end{itemize}

C: The passage supports the idea that Chie is amused by Akira's proposal, but not that she is mocking or disparaging towards him. Her amusement seems to stem from her view of him as somewhat naive and childlike. Akira does not appear to perceive any mockery or disparagement in Chie's tone or behavior. 
D: The passage supports the idea that Akira addresses Chie with respect. He bows, uses formal language, and asks for her forgiveness before delivering his proposal. However, he is not totally deferential - he speaks with confidence and conviction and delivers his message without hedging or equivocating. 
Thought: Akira speaks politely and formally to Chie, but he also seems confident and self-assured. Chie views him as childlike and a bit naive, but she also takes his proposal seriously. 
Therefore, the best answer is D: respect but not utter deference.
Criticism: This answer is based on a reading of Akira's speech as confident and self-assured rather than completely deferential. It is possible that another reader might interpret Akira's tone as more deferential or less respectful. Additionally, the description of Akira's speech and behavior is somewhat subjective and open to interpretation. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes a conversation between Akira and Chie, where Akira asks for permission to marry Chie's daughter, Naomi. 
  A: Affection denotes a feeling of liking or fondness towards someone or something. The passage gives no indication that Akira has feelings of affection towards Chie.
  B: Objectivity refers to the ability to perceive something without personal biases. There is no indication in the passage that Akira is objective towards Chie.
  C: Amusement refers to the state of being entertained or finding something funny. The passage indicates that Chie finds Akira's proposal and manner of approaching her amusing, rather than mockingly disparaging.
  D: Respect refers to admiration for someone or something based on their qualities or achievements. The passage states that Akira comes to Chie with "deference," meaning respect and politeness. However, he does not show utter deference or excessive respect that might be considered obsequious. 
Thought:
  Akira comes to Chie to ask for permission to marry her daughter, which is a serious and respectful act.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L. Cox-Foster et al., "A Metagenomic Survey of Microbes in Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder." @2007 by American Association for the Advancement of Science.The table above shows, for colonies with colony collapse disorder and for colonies without colony collapse disorder, the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together
Question: Based on data in the table, in what percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder were the honeybees infected by all four pathogens?
Choices:
  A: 0 percent
  B: 77 percent
  C: 83 percent
  D: 100 percent
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The table shows the occurrence of four pathogens in honey bees with and without colony collapse disorder.
  For Nosema ceranae, the table shows "All four pathogens" without any specific percentages.
Thought:
  The table lists the percentages for each of the four pathogens in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
  However, for Nosema ceranae, the table only shows "All four pathogens", so it is not possible to directly determine the percentage of colonies with all four pathogens.
  Therefore, the answer is "none of the above" because the data in the table does not provide a specific percentage for honey bee colonies with colony collapse disorder infected by all four pathogens.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The table shows data on the percent of honey bee colonies affected by different pathogens for colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
  The pathogen information is presented separately for each group.
Thought:
  We need to find the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that had honeybees infected by all four pathogens.
  Looking at the row labeled "Nosema ceranae," we see that all four pathogens are combined into one category.
  We need to look at the percent for "Colonies with colony collapse disorder" in this row to find the answer.
  The value in this row for "Colonies with colony collapse disorder" is "All four pathogens."
  Therefore, the answer is D: 100 percent.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: The table shows the percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder and without colony collapse disorder having honey bees infected by four different pathogens and all four pathogens together. 
Thought: We need to find out what percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by all four pathogens. This information is given in the table under the "All four pathogens" category. The only cell in the table that refers to all four pathogens does not give a percentage for colonies with colony collapse disorder; it only has the information that all four pathogens were present in all cases of Nosema ceranae. Therefore, the answer is A, 0 percent. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The table shows the percent of colonies affected by various pathogens for both colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
  Nosema apis only affected colonies with colony collapse disorder.
  Nosema ceranae affected all colonies, with or without colony collapse disorder.
  For clusters of symptoms resembling colony collapse disorder, CDC criteria require no disease other than varroa mites and less than 20% of cells with Varroa destructormites.
Thought:
  The question asks for the percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens.
  Looking at the table, viruses are found in 83% of colonies with colony collapse disorder and IAPV is found in 100% of colonies with colony collapse disorder.
  KBV is found in 90% of colonies with colony collapse disorder, and Nosema apis affects 77% of colonies with colony collapse disorder.
  Nosema ceranae affects all four pathogens.
  Therefore, all four pathogens are found in colonies with colony collapse disorder, and the answer is D: 100 percent.
Criticism:
  The table shows the percent of colonies that have been infected with each of the four pathogens but does not show the number of colonies analyzed. 
  Also, the study only looked at a small sample of bees from a limited area. 
  The results may not be generalizable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The table shows data on pathogen occurrence in honey bee colonies.
  The table compares percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder and without.
  The table shows the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by each pathogen individually and all four pathogens together.
Thought:
  The table shows the percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder having honey bees infected by all four pathogens together is "All four pathogens."
  Nosema ceranae is one of the four pathogens.
  For colonies with colony collapse disorder, the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by Nosema ceranae is "All four pathogens".
  Therefore, the honeybees in 100 percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by all four pathogens.
  The answer is D: 100 percent.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct and there is no flaw in it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The table shows data on the occurrence of pathogen infections in honey bee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder (CCD).
  The table lists four pathogens and the percent of colonies affected by each of the pathogens, as well as the percent of colonies affected by all four pathogens together.
Thought: 
  The table shows that for colonies with CCD, 100% were infected with Nosema ceranae, and all four pathogens were present in these colonies.
  Therefore, based on the data in the table, in 100% of colonies with CCD, the honeybees were infected by all four pathogens.
  The answer is D: 100 percent.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct. The table shows that all the colonies with CCD were infected with Nosema ceranae and had all four pathogens present.
  Therefore, 100% of honeybee colonies with CCD had all four pathogens.
  There are no flaws in your facts, logic, and reasoning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The table shows the percent of colonies affected by different pathogen in honey bee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
  The pathogens listed in the table are viruses (including IAPV and KBV), fungi (including Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae), and all four pathogens together.
Thought: 
  We need to find out the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens.
  Looking at the table, the only row containing "all four pathogens" is the row for Nosema ceranae.
  The percentage for Nosema ceranae under "colonies with colony collapse disorder" is 100 percent.
  Therefore, the answer to the question is D: 100 percent.
Criticism: 
  The above thought process is correct based on the data in the table.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: The table shows data on the percent of colonies affected by pathogens in honey bee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder. The table shows that at least one pathogen affected honey bee colonies regardless of whether or not they had colony collapse disorder. 
Thought: We need to find the percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder that had honey bees infected by all four pathogens. According to the table, Nosema ceranae infected all four pathogens. Thus, we need to find the value for this pathogen under colonies with colony collapse disorder. The table shows that the value for Nosema ceranae is "All four pathogens." Therefore, the answer is 100 percent.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The table shows data on the percent of colonies with honey bees infected by different pathogens.
  The table compares the data for two groups: colonies with colony collapse disorder, and colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  The four pathogens listed are: viruses, IAPV, KBV, and fungi.
Thought:
  The table has a row specifically for "all four pathogens."
  For colonies with colony collapse disorder, the percent of honey bee colonies infected by all four pathogens is listed as "All four pathogens."
  According to the table, "IAPV" has a 100 percent infection rate for colonies with colony collapse disorder.
  Since "All four pathogens" includes IAPV, we know the percent infected by all four pathogens must be equal to or less than 100 percent.
  Based on the data in the table, there is no percent given for "All four pathogens" in colonies without colony collapse disorder, so it must be 0 percent.
  Therefore, the answer is A: 0 percent.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The table shows the percent of honey bee colonies affected by different pathogens.
  The table differentiates between colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
  The question is asking for the percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder affected by all four pathogens.
Thought:
  Look at the row for "All four pathogens" in the table. 
  The honey bees in all of the colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by Nosema ceranae.
  Therefore, the percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder affected by all four pathogens is 0 percent.
  The answer is A: 0 percent.
Criticism:
  You are correct that the honey bees in all of the colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by Nosema ceranae.
  However, Nosema ceranae is only one of the four pathogens. 
  The table does not provide information on what percent of colonies were affected by all four pathogens.
  Therefore, we cannot answer the question based on the information provided in the table.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar. In 1789,.the French formed a new governmental body known as the.National Assembly, ushering in the tumultuous period of.political and social change known as the French Revolution..To make a government requires no great.prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach obedience,.and the work is done. To give freedom is still more.easy. It is not necessary to guide; it only requires to.let go the rein. But to form a free government, that is,.to temper together these opposite elements of liberty.and restraint in one consistent work, requires much.thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and.combining mind. This I do not find in those who.take the lead in the National Assembly. Perhaps they.are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather.believe it. It would put them below the common level.of human understanding. But when the leaders.choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of.popularity, their talents, in the construction of the.state, will be of no service. They will become.flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not.the guides, of the people. If any of them should.happen to propose a scheme of liberty, soberly.limited and defined with proper qualifications, he.will be immediately outbid by his competitors who.will produce something more splendidly popular..Suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause..Moderation will be stigmatized as the virtue of.cowards, and compromise as the prudence of.traitors, until, in hopes of preserving the credit which.may enable him to temper and moderate, on some.occasions, the popular leader is obliged to become.active in propagating doctrines and establishing.powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose.at which he ultimately might have aimed..But am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all.that deserves commendation in the indefatigable.labors of this Assembly? I do not deny that, among.an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, some.good may have been done. They who destroy.everything certainly will remove some grievance..They who make everything new have a chance that.they may establish something beneficial. To give.them credit for what they have done in virtue of the.authority they have usurped, or which can excuse.them in the crimes by which that authority has been.acquired, it must appear that the same things could.not have been accomplished without producing such.a revolution. Most assuredly they might....Some.usages have been abolished on just grounds, but.they were such that if they had stood as they were to.all eternity, they would little detract from the.happiness and prosperity of any state. The.improvements of the National Assembly are.superficial, their errors fundamental..Whatever they are, I wish my countrymen rather.to recommend to our neighbors the example of the.British constitution than to take models from them.for the improvement of our own. In the former, they.have got an invaluable treasure. They are not, I think,.without some causes of apprehension and complaint,.but these they do not owe to their constitution but to.their own conduct. I think our happy situation owing.to our constitution, but owing to the whole of it, and.not to any part singly, owing in a great measure to.what we have left standing in our several reviews and.reformations as well as to what we have altered or.superadded. Our people will find employment.enough for a truly patriotic, free, and independent.spirit in guarding what they possess from violation. I.would not exclude alteration neither, but even when.I changed, it should be to preserve. I should be led to.my remedy by a great grievance. In what I did, I.should follow the example of our ancestors. I would.make the reparation as nearly as possible in the style.of the building. A politic caution, a guarded.circumspection, a moral rather than a complexional.timidity were among the ruling principles of our.forefathers in their most decided conduct. Not being.illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of.France tell us they have got so abundant a share, they.acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and.fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus.fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct.attended to their nature. Let us imitate their caution.if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their.bequests. Let us add, if we please, but let us preserve.what they have left; and, standing on the firm ground.of the British constitution, let us be satisfied to.admire rather than attempt to follow in their.desperate flights the aeronauts of France.

Think of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who will build a . . civilization of energy and industry in Cuba, when a government of law35 replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!think of the prosperous millions that Empress of Islands will support when, obedient to the law of political gravitation, her people ask for the highest honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the40 Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great Republic!\section{Passage 2}If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the45 Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability.The Filipinos do not need any encouragement 50 from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated tomake the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, "Give me liberty or give me death," he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.60 Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.$65 \mathrm{Or}$, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are 70 forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or 75 spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so80 low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also85 calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: It is well known that some animal species use.camouflage to hide from predators. Individuals that.are able to blend in to their surroundings and avoid.being eaten are able to survive longer, reproduce, and.thus increase their fitness (pass along their genes to.the next generation) compared to those who stand.out more. This may seem like a good strategy, and.fairly common in the animal kingdom, but who ever.heard of a plant doing the same thing?.In plants, the use of coloration or pigmentation as.a vital component of acquiring food (e.g.,.photosynthesis) or as a means of attracting.pollinators (e.g., flowers) has been well studied..However, variation in pigmentation as a means of.escaping predation has received little attention..Matthew Klooster from Harvard University and.colleagues empirically investigated whether the dried.bracts (specialized leaves) on a rare woodland plant,.Monotropsis odorata, might serve a similar purpose.as the stripes on a tiger or the grey coloration of the.wings of the peppered moth: namely, to hide..“Monotropsis odoratais a fascinating plant.species, as it relies exclusively upon mycorrhizal.fungus, that associates with its roots, for all of the.resources it needs to live,” notes Klooster. “Because.this plant no longer requires photosynthetic.pigmentation (i.e., green coloration) to produce its.own energy, it is free to adopt a broader range of.possibilities in coloration, much like fungi or.animals.”.Using a large population ofMonotropsis odorata,.Klooster and colleagues experimentally removed the.dried bracts that cover the 3- to 5-cm tall stems and.flower buds of these woodland plants. The bracts are.a brown color that resembles the leaf litter from.which the reproductive stems emerge and cover the.pinkish-purple colored buds and deep purple stems..When Klooster and colleagues measured the.reflectance pattern (the percentage of light reflected.at various wavelengths) of the different plant parts,.they indeed found that the bracts functioned as.camouflage, making the plant blend in with its.surroundings; the bract reflectance pattern closely.resembled that of the leaf litter, and both differed.from that of the reproductive stem and flowers.hidden underneath the bracts. Furthermore, they.experimentally demonstrated that this camouflage.actually worked to hide the plant from its predators.and increased its fitness. Individuals with intact.bracts suffered only a quarter of the herbivore.damage and produced a higher percentage of mature.fruits compared to those whose bracts were removed..“It has long been shown that animals use cryptic.coloration (camouflage) as a defense mechanism to.visually match a component of their natural.environment, which facilitates predator avoidance,”.Klooster said. “We have now experimentally.demonstrated that plants have evolved a similar.strategy to avoid their herbivores.”.Drying its bracts early to hide its reproductive.parts is a good strategy when the stems are exposed.to predators for long periods of time: all the other.species in the subfamily Monotropoideae have.colorful fleshy bracts and are reproductively active.for only a quarter of the length of time. Somewhat.paradoxically, however,Monotropsis odorataactually.relies on animals for pollination and seed dispersal..How does it accomplish this when it is disguised as.dead leaf material and is able to hide so well? The.authors hypothesize that the flowers emit highly.fragrant odors that serve to attract pollinators and.seed dispersal agents; indeed they observed bumble.bees finding and pollinating many reproductive.stems that were entirely hidden by the leaf litter itself.
Question: The passage indicates that compared with other functions of coloration in plants, camouflage in plants has
Choices:
  A: provided scientists with a deeper understanding of potential food sources.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.Let every American, every lover of liberty, every.well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the.Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,.the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their.violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did.to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so.to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every.American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred.honor;—let every man remember that to violate the.law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to.tear the character of his own, and his children’s.liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by.every American mother, to the lisping babe, that.prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in.seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in.Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be.preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative.halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,.let it become thepolitical religionof the nation;.and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,.the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and.colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its.altars.....When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of.all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there.are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,.for the redress of which, no legal provisions have.been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do.mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,.should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they.continue in force, for the sake of example, they.should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided.cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be.made for them with the least possible delay; but, till.then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with..There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress.by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,.the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two.positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right.within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of.all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and.therefore proper to be prohibited by legal.enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition.of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable..Passage 2.Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey.them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey.them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress.them at once? Men generally, under such a.government as this, think that they ought to wait.until they have persuaded the majority to alter them..They think that, if they should resist, the remedy.would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the.government itself that the remedy is worse than the.evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to.anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not.cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist.before it is hurt?....If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of.the machine of government, let it go, let it go;.perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the.machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or.a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,.then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy.will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a.nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice.to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be.a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have.to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to.the wrong which I condemn..As for adopting the ways which the State has.provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such.ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will.be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into.this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to.live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has.not everything to do, but something; and because he.cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he.should do something wrong.....I do not hesitate to say, that those who call.themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually.withdraw their support, both in person and property,.from the government...andnotwait till they.constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the.right to prevail through them. I think that it is.enough if they have God on their side, without.waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more.right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one.already.

Thought:
  Lincoln argues that violating the law tramples on the blood of the Revolution and threatens the character of individual and collective liberty.
  Breaking the law would repudiate the values for which the patriots of seventy-six stood.
  This would create an example of disobedience and disrespect for the law which others may follow, leading to chaos and disobedience of the law.
  Therefore, violating the law would undermine the nation's values, lead to the erosion of rule of law, and threaten individual liberties and civil order.
  The answer is B: It undermines and repudiates the nation’s values.
Criticism:
  The thought process seems correct, as Lincoln argues that the law must be revered and strictly observed to uphold the Constitution, maintain order, and protect individual liberties.
  Breaking the law is akin to trampling on the blood of the patriots who fought for the revolutionary values of liberty and equality and threatens to erode the fabric of the nation.
  Therefore, (B) is the best answer.
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: Based on Passage 2, Meltzer and his team relied on what evidence to challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis?
Choices:
  A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact
  B: The discovery of additional Clovis artifacts in a host of sites besides the 29 initially identified
  C: Analyses showing that nanodiamonds can occur in geologic formations lacking indications of extraterrestrial impacts
  D: High concentrations of iridium that have been found in sedimentary layers beneath the proposed impact layer
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses evidence that challenges the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  The Younger Dryas impact hypothesis proposes that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago — causing a millennium-long cooling period, which led to the extinction of Clovis hunters and large mammals in North America.
  Meltzer and his team present evidence challenging the hypothesis.
Thought: 
  Meltzer and his team challenged the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  They reevaluated the dates assigned to the 29 different sites where impact advocates reported evidence of a cosmic collision.
  Upon closer examination, only three of the sites were found to fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
  Therefore, Meltzer and his team relied on A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct. Therefore, there is no criticism to be made.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses a recent publication by a team of researchers led by David Meltzer. 
  The paper challenges the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis proposed by proponents of extraterrestrial impact. 
  The paper scrutinizes the dating evidence of 29 sites across the world where the impact hypothesis was suggested to occur. 
  The paper concludes that only three sites might contain evidence of the impact.
Thought: 
  According to Passage 2, Meltzer and his team relied on the radiocarbon and other techniques-based evaluation of dates assigned to geological sites (clovis points) thought to display signs of the indicated impact to challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  Therefore, the answer is A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
Criticism: 
  Your logic and reasoning are correct, and the answer is A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact. 
  No other findings except the reevaluation of the given evidence by researchers led by David Meltzer were mentioned in Passage 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes research by scientists arguing that an asteroid or comet exploded on or above the northern ice cap approximately 13,000 years ago, causing temperatures to drop and large mammals to go extinct.
  Passage 2 discusses criticisms of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which proposes that this asteroid or comet caused the cooling and extinction events. 
  David Meltzer and his team question the validity of evidence presented by proponents of the hypothesis.
Thought: 
  Meltzer and his team challenged the hypothesis that an impact caused the Younger Dryas by looking at the dates of 29 sites where impact evidence had been purportedly found. 
  After analyzing the dates, they found that only three sites supported the impact event occurring during the onset of the Younger Dryas.
  In other words, the team suggested that proponents of the impact hypothesis had misinterpreted the dating of these sites and other evidence to support their argument.
  Therefore, the answer is A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct that Meltzer's team questioned the validity of the evidence used to support the Younger Dryas Impact hypothesis.
  However, the passage only states that Meltzer reevaluated the dates of sites exhibiting signs of the alleged impact, but does not mention any other type of evidence used to challenge the hypothesis.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 presents new evidence that contests the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  Meltzer's team reevaluates the dating of 29 sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East.
  The team claims that only three of the 29 sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
  The evidence for the cosmic collision, including deposits of iridium, nanodiamonds, and magnetic particles, is not reliable or present at the right time.
Thought:
  Meltzer's team challenges the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  The team reevaluates the dates assigned to sites that previously displayed signs of the proposed impact.
  The evidence for the cosmic collision, including deposits of iridium, nanodiamonds, and magnetic particles, is not reliable or present at the right time.
  Therefore, Meltzer and his team relied on A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 provides information about new studies that challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  Meltzer and his team have published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in which they examine the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East.
  These sites include those in which Clovis points have been found.
  Meltzer's team argues that only three of the 29 sites align with the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset of about 12,800 years ago, and that the rest were likely either earlier or later by hundreds or thousands of years.
Thought:
  The question is asking about the specific evidence that Meltzer and his team relied on to challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  The passage states that Meltzer and his team examined the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, including those in which Clovis points have been found.
  The team argues that, when the quality and accuracy of the dating is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites align with the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
  Therefore, the evidence that Meltzer and his team relied on to challenge the hypothesis is a reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
  The answer is A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
Criticism:
  There is no indication in the passage that Meltzer's team discovered additional Clovis artifacts beside the 29 initially identified.
  While Passage 2 does mention that some specialists contest claims about the discovery of nanodiamonds, this is not the evidence that Meltzer and his team relied on.
  While Passage 2 mentions that Richard Firestone, a proponent of the impact hypothesis, disagrees with Meltzer's team, this is not the evidence that Meltzer and his team relied on to challenge the hypothesis.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses challenges to the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  The hypothesis posits that a comet or asteroid caused significant climate changes and the extinction of large mammals around 13,000 years ago.
  Multiple types of evidence have been given to support the hypothesis, including deposits of iridium, nanodiamonds, and magnetic particles.
  Meltzer and his team have provided evidence to challenge the hypothesis.
Thought:
  The question is asking what evidence Meltzer and his team relied on to challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  The passage states that Meltzer's team looked at the dating of 29 different sites, including those where Clovis points were found.
  They argue that three out of the 29 sites fall within the time frame of the onset of the Younger Dryas, and that the others are probably earlier or later by hundreds or thousands of years.
  Therefore, Meltzer and his team challenge the hypothesis by questioning the dates assigned to the sites.
  The answer is A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
Criticism:
  Your answer is correct. 
  No other evidence besides a "reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact" is discussed in Passage 2 for challenging the Younger Dryas hypothesis.
Action: Answer("A")

  They look at the dating of 29 different sites, including ones where Clovis points have been found, and argue that only three of the sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
Thought:
  Meltzer and his team challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  They examine the dating of 29 sites, including those with Clovis artifacts, and conclude that only three of them fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.
  Therefore, their challenge to the hypothesis is based on a reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
  The answer is A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct.
  The other options are not supported by information in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 reports that Meltzer and his team challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  Meltzer's team looked at 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East where impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision.
  They examined the quality and accuracy of the dating (radiocarbon and other techniques) used to establish the age of the sites.
Thought:
  The question asks what evidence Meltzer and his team relied on to challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  Passage 2 indicates that Meltzer and his team examined the quality and accuracy of the dating used to establish the age of 29 sites that offered evidence for a cosmic collision.
  Meltzer argues that when the dating of these sites is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites fall within the timeframe of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago.
  Meltzer and his team therefore question the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis which is based on a confluence of dates.
  The correct answer is A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:

  B: The passage does not mention the discovery of additional Clovis artifacts.
  C: The discussion of nanodiamonds is mentioned in the passage as support for the opposing view of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
  D: The presence of high iridium concentrations is mentioned in the passage as evidence in favor of the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.
Thought: 
  Melzter has published a paper presenting a challenge to the hypothesis that a cosmic collision caused the Younger Dryas onset and disruptions to human society.
  The challenge is based on a close examination of the published sites and the dating of those sites.
  Meltzer and his team find that only three of the 29 sites providing support for the cosmic collision hypothesis actually fall within the timeframe of the Younger Dryas onset.
  This suggests that most of the sites used to support the hypothesis have different causes.
  Therefore, the evidence provided by the dating of sites presents the strongest challenge yet to the hypothesis.
  Answer A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
Criticism: 
  No flaws are found in the facts, logic, and reasoning provided.
Action: Answer("A")

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.
Question: The author indicates that it seems initially plausible thatTexas gourd plants could attract more pollinators if they
Choices:
  A: did not have aromatic flowers.
  B: targeted insects other than bees.
  C: increased their floral scent.
  D: emitted more varied fragrant compounds.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses a study conducted on Texas gourd plants and their pollinators.
  The study tested whether increasing the fragrance of the plant would attract more pollinators or repel them.
Thought:
  The article discusses the study's hypothesis that increasing the scent of the Texas gourd plant would attract more pollinators.
  The study enhanced the fragrance of the Texas gourd plant by tucking treated swabs inside their flowers.
  The researchers found that fragrance-enhanced flowers attracted more beetles and had fewer visits from honey bees.
  Theis thinks that honey bees avoided the enhanced flowers because of the abundance of beetles present.
  The researchers also found that the enhanced flowers produced weaker fruit and had fewer seeds than the normal flowers.
  Therefore, the article suggests that increasing the scent of the Texas gourd plant is not beneficial for attracting pollinators.
  The answer is NOT C: increased their floral scent.
Criticism:
  The answer could also be interpreted as not plausible for the Texas gourd plant to attract more pollinators if they targeted insects other than bees. However, the article does not provide any evidence to support this idea. Therefore, the best answer is C: increased their floral scent.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

  The aroma that attracts those bees includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant and effective is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
  The researchers wanted to find out if an increase in fragrance would attract more pollinators or more beetles.
Thought:
  The article states that the researchers wanted to find out if an increase in fragrance would attract more pollinators, so C, "increased their floral scent," seems to be the correct answer. 
Criticism: 
  There is no information in the article regarding options A, B, or D. 
  While the study did aim to test whether increasing the floral scent would attract more pollinators, the answer is not explicit in the question. However, C is still the most likely answer based on the information provided.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes a study on the Texas gourd plant's attraction of pollinators and avoidance of cucumber beetles.
  The plant's primary pollinators are honey bees and squash bees, which respond to its floral scent.
  The aroma of the plant includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant and the only one that lures squash bees into traps is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
Thought: 
  The study was conducted to determine how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles.
  The researchers made half of the plants in the study more fragrant by adding 1,4-dimethoxybenzene to their flowers.
  Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should be even more appealing to bees.
  However, the study found that pollinators did not prefer the highly scented flowers, and squash bees were indifferent.
  Honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often than normal ones.
  The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent.
  Therefore, the answer is NOT C: increased their floral scent.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not discuss the possibility that not having aromatic flowers or targeting insects other than bees could attract more pollinators to the Texas gourd plant.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Texas gourd plants attract bees for pollination.
  Striped cucumber beetles are attracted by the floral scent and can harm the plant.
  The Texas gourd vine's main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees.
  Extra scent could attract both pollinators and beetles.
Thought:
  The article explains that adding more of the most attractive odor to the flowers of the Texas gourd plant does not lead to more pollinators.
  The researchers observed that the more beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to visit it.
  Both squash bees and honey bees did not prefer the more scented flowers.
  There is no indication that targeting other insects or emitting more fragrant compounds would necessarily increase pollinators, especially since this study demonstrates that attracting more pollinators may also attract more beetles.
  Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: increased their floral scent.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses a study on the Texas gourd plant and its pollinators.
  The Texas gourd plant attracts honey and squash bees with its floral scent.
  The aroma includes 10 compounds, but the one compound that attracts squash bees is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
Thought:
  The study tested whether increasing the concentration of the attractive compound, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, would attract more bees.
  It was intuitive to assume that increasing the scent would attract more pollinators.
  The study had two groups of the Texas gourd plant, one group with dimethoxybenzene-treated flowers and another without.
  The team studied the behavior of pollinators to observe which group of plants they prefer.
  The data shows that squash bees were not affected by the stronger scent.
  However, pollination rates in fragrance-enhanced flowers reduced because honey bees visited them less.
  This reduction in pollination resulted in less production of fruit, which was also smaller and lighter.
  Increased scent actually resulted in double the normal number of beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
  Therefore, it seems initially plausible that Texas gourd plants could attract more pollinators if they increased their floral scent, but this study concludes that too much fragrance could result in higher beetle numbers and reduced pollination.
  The answer is C: increased their floral scent.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses the Texas gourd plant and its pollinators along with its predators.
  The article mentions one study conducted on the Texas gourd that aimed to attract enough pollinators but avoid attracting too many beetles.
  The study focused on the floral scent of the Texas gourd.
  The aroma of the Texas gourd includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, which is the only one that lures special squash bees.
Thought:
  The study aimed to solve the problem of attracting pollinators but avoiding predators.
  Intuition suggested that increasing the floral scent would increase the number of pollinators but attract predators too.
  To test this hypothesis, the researchers conducted an experiment by making half of the Texas gourd plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers.
  After the experiment, the researchers observed that more fragrance did not increase the number of pollinators.
  However, the extra scent did call in more beetles, which caused damage to flowers and deterred pollinators.
  Therefore, it seems initially plausible that Texas gourd plants could attract more pollinators if they emitted more floral scent.
  The answer is C: increased their floral scent.
Criticism:
  There is no information provided in the context that might lead to any reasonable doubt about this answer. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses a study on Texas gourd plants and their pollinators.
  The Texas gourd vine's main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent.
  One compound, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, is the only one that lures squash bees in traps.
  The researchers wanted to see if increasing the abundance of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene would attract more pollinators.
Thought:
  The article notes that increasing the abundance of scent could attract more pollinators, such as bees.
  Therefore, increasing the floral scent of Texas gourd plants may initially seem plausible.
  The answer is C: increased their floral scent.
Criticism:
  There is no indication in the article that not having aromatic flowers, targeting insects other than bees, or emitting more varied fragrant compounds would attract more pollinators.
  In fact, the article discusses that too much fragrance could actually attract unwanted insects and repel honey bees.
  Therefore, it is not initially plausible to choose answer choices A, B, or D.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a study on Texas gourd vines, which attract honey bees and specialized squash bees to pollinate their flowers.
  The scent of the Texas gourd vine's flowers contains 10 compounds, but only 1,4-dimethoxybenzene attracts squash bees.
  The study planted Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and experimented with adding more 1,4-dimethoxybenzene to some of the flowers' scent.
Thought:
  The study was testing whether more floral scent would attract more pollinators or more beetles.
  It seems initially plausible that increasing the floral scent of the Texas gourd vine would attract more pollinators.
  Therefore, choice C, "increased their floral scent," is the most likely answer.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the passage that suggests any of the other choices are plausible.
  Choice A, "did not have aromatic flowers," goes against the basic premise of the study that the scent of Texas gourd vine flowers are necessary to attract pollinators.
  Choice B, "targeted insects other than bees," does not make sense because bees are the primary pollinators of Texas gourd vines.
  Choice D, "emitted more varied fragrant compounds," is not discussed in the passage and there is no evidence to suggest that this would attract more pollinators or beetles.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses a study of the Texas gourd plant and how to attract pollinators without attracting too many beetles.
  The main pollinators of the Texas gourd vine are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent.
  The aroma of the Texas gourd includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant and the only one that lures squash bees into traps is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene. 
Thought: 
  The article discusses whether increased floral scent would attract more pollinators to the Texas gourd plant.
  The study tested whether more of a specific compound, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, would attract more pollinators.
  The article reports that extra scent did not call in more pollinators and in fact resulted in fewer visits from honey bees.
  Therefore, it is not plausible that increasing the floral scent of the Texas gourd plant would attract more pollinators.
  The answer is not C: increased their floral scent.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that it is not plausible that increasing the floral scent of the Texas gourd plant would attract more pollinators.
  However, the question asks which option seems initially plausible based on the information in the article, not whether it is actually true.
  It is possible that some readers would assume that increased floral scent would attract more pollinators.
  Therefore, the most plausible answer is C: increased their floral scent.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The article discusses a study on the Texas gourd plant and its pollinators.
  The main pollinators of the Texas gourd are honey bees and specialized squash bees.
  The Texas gourd plant attracts striped cucumber beetles, which can damage flowers and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
Thought:
  The article mentions a study on how to attract enough pollinators to the Texas gourd plant without attracting too many beetles.
  45 times more fragrance was added to some Texas gourd plants to test whether more scent would attract more pollinators.
  However, the study found that pollinators did not prefer the highly scented flowers, and honey bees visited the enhanced flowers less often.
  The article concludes that Texas gourd plants do not produce a stronger scent because ramping up the odor would not attract more pollinators, but would attract more beetles.
  Therefore, it seems initially plausible that increasing the floral scent would attract more pollinators, but it actually attracts more beetles and repels some pollinators.
  The correct answer is C: increased their floral scent.
Criticism:
  There does not seem to be any information in the article to support any of the other choices.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, "Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."40 He picked up a bird shape: "Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought." He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: "Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind."As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. "Look here," Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. "See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this." And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. "The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price."I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.
Question: In Passage 1, Beecher makes which point about the status of women relative to that of men?
Choices:
  A: Women depend on men for their safety and security, but men are largely independent of women.
  B: Women are inferior to men, but women play a role as significant as that played by men.
  C: Women have fewer rights than men do, but women also have fewer responsibilities.
  D: Women are superior to men, but tradition requires women to obey men.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the roles and power of women in society.
  A: The passage does not mention dependency or safety.
  B: The passage asserts that women hold a subordinate position in society to men but that their duties and influence are equally important and pervasive.
  C: The passage does not compare the number of rights or responsibilities between men and women.
  D: The passage does not suggest that women are superior to men. It argues the opposite, that men and women have different but equally important roles in society and should not be compared based on sex.
Thought:
  Passage 1 does not argue that women are inferior to men in every way, just that they hold a subordinate position in society.
  It also asserts that women's duties and influence are equally important and pervasive.
  Therefore, Beecher's point is that women are inferior to men, but women play a role as significant as that played by men.
  The answer is B.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: Passage 1 discusses the role and influence of women in society.
  A: This is not mentioned in Passage 1.
  B: Beecher argues that women hold a subordinate relation to men, but their influence is still important and powerful in its own way.
  C: This is not mentioned in Passage 1.
  D: This is not mentioned in Passage 1.
Thought: 
  Beecher argues that women hold a subordinate relation to men in society.
  Despite this, their duties and influence are important and powerful in their own way.
  This suggests that women are not seen as equals to men, but they still have a significant role to play.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Women are inferior to men, but women play a role as significant as that played by men.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that Beecher argues that women hold a subordinate relation to men.
  However, Beecher does not explicitly state that women are inferior to men. 
  Instead, she argues that men and women have different roles and ways of exerting power and influence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the role and influence of women in society.
  Passage 2 explores the parallels between the abolitionist movement and women's rights.
  A: The passage does not discuss women's safety and security in relation to men's independence.
  B: The passage argues that women hold a subordinate position in society to men, but that this does not diminish their importance or influence.
  C: The passage does not argue that women have fewer rights or responsibilities than men.
  D: The passage does not argue that women are superior to men.
Thought:
  In Passage 1, Grimké argues that women play an important role in society but that their mode of influence and power differs from men's. This implies that women are subordinate to men in society.
  Therefore, Beecher might argue in opposition that women are not inferior to men and play an equally significant role in society.
  However, there is no mention of Beecher's arguments in Passage 1.
  Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the information given.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the duties and power of women in society and their role relative to men.
  A: This statement is not mentioned in Passage 1.
  B: This statement is partially true. Passage 1 acknowledges that women hold a subordinate relation in society, but also emphasizes the importance and power of their duties and influence.
  C: This statement is not mentioned in Passage 1.
  D: This statement is not mentioned in Passage 1.
Thought:
  Passage 1 emphasizes that while women hold a subordinate relation to men in society, their duties and influence are still important and powerful.
  The passage also highlights the unique ways in which women can gain and exercise power, emphasizing peaceful and benevolent principles over coercion and competition.
  Therefore, Beecher does not argue that women are inferior to men but acknowledges their important role in society.
  The answer is B: Women are inferior to men, but women play a role as significant as that played by men.
Criticism:
  You correctly identify that Option B represents the point that Beecher makes about the status of women relative to that of men.
  However, it is important to point out that Beecher does not argue that women are inferior to men.
  Rather, she emphasizes the importance and power of women's duties and influence in society, while acknowledging that they hold a subordinate relation to men.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the roles and influence of men and women in society, particularly in domestic settings.
  A: This idea is not discussed in either Passage 1 or Passage 2.
  B: Passage 1 argues that women hold a subordinate position in society to men, but this does not necessarily imply that women's role is as significant as that of men.
  C: The idea that women have fewer rights and responsibilities than men is not discussed in Passage 1.
  D: This idea is also not discussed in Passage 1 or Passage 2.
Thought: 
  The question asks about Beecher's point about the status of women relative to that of men.
  According to Passage 1, women hold a subordinate position in society to men, but this does not necessarily imply that women's role is as significant as that of men.
  Answer choice B most closely aligns with this idea.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Women are inferior to men, but women play a role as significant as that played by men.
Criticism: 
  Answer choice B is a partially correct interpretation of Passage 1, but it does not fully encapsulate Beecher's point.
  While it is true that Beecher argues that women hold a subordinate position to men, she also emphasizes that this does not diminish the importance of women's roles and influence.
  However, Beecher does not explicitly state that women's role is as significant as that of men.
  Therefore, the answer may be more accurately stated as "Women are inferior to men, but their importance and influence are not diminished by their subordinate position.".
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the relationship between men and women in society.
  Passage 1 argues that women hold a subordinate position to men in society, but that their duties and influence are still important.
  Passage 1 emphasizes that the way in which women gain influence and power is different from the way in which men gain influence and power.
Thought:
  Option A is contradicted by Passage 1's emphasis on the importance of women's duties and influence.
  Option B reflects some of Passage 1's ideas, but it suggests that women are inherently inferior to men, which is not a view expressed in Passage 1.
  Option C is contradicted by Passage 1's argument that the mode of gaining influence and power for women is different from that of men.
  Option D is also contradicted by Passage 1, which argues that women hold a subordinate position in society.
  Therefore, none of the available options accurately reflects Beecher's point about the status of women relative to that of men.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the relationships between men and women in society.
  Passage 1 argues that women hold a subordinate station to men in society.
  It also argues that the duties and power of women are important but should be exercised differently than those of men.
  Passage 2 discusses the rights of slaves and how they are connected to the rights of women.
  It argues that men and women have essentially the same rights because they are moral beings.
Thought:
  It is implied in Passage 1 that men hold a superior status to women.
  However, it does not say that women are inferior to men, that women play a role as significant as that played by men, or that women are superior to men.
  Therefore, none of these options is the correct answer.
  It does say that women hold a subordinate station to men, so it is likely that Beecher's point is that women are subordinate to men.
  The answer is probably A: Women depend on men for their safety and security, but men are largely independent of women.
Criticism:
  Although it is true that Passage 1 argues that women hold a subordinate station to men, it does not explicitly mention women depending on men for safety and security or men being independent of women.
  Therefore, A is not the best answer.
  B, C, and D are all directly contradicted by the passage, so they are definitely not the correct answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 argues that women hold a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, but their duties and influence are still important and powerful, albeit different.
  Passage 2 argues that human beings have rights because they are moral beings; sex does not determine rights or responsibilities.
Thought:
  The question asks what Beecher said in Passage 1.
  Passage 1 argues that women hold a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, but their duties and influence are still important and powerful, albeit different. 
  Therefore, Beecher did not make the point that women are inferior to men, superior to men, or dependent on men for safety and security.
  The closest option to what Beecher said is that women play a role as significant as that played by men. 
  However, it is not an accurate representation of what Beecher wrote in Passage 1 about the subordination of women.
Criticism:
  It is important to accurately represent Beecher's argument in Passage 1.
  Though Passage 1 states that the "superior" and "subordinate" roles have been "appointed" to men and women respectively, it does not explicitly state that one is "inferior" or that one is "less significant" than the other. 
  Thus, the options may not accurately reflect what Beecher argued in Passage 1. 
  However, B is the closest answer choice to Beecher's argument in Passage 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes the role of women in society and the differences between the ways women and men can exert power and influence.
  Passage 2 discusses the rights of slaves and the relationship between human rights and the moral nature of people.
Thought:
  Passage 1 does not make a clear statement about the status of women relative to men.
  However, the passage does emphasize that women have important duties and influence, but must exert their power in a different way than men.
  It suggests that women can only gain power through peaceful means and by earning the respect and admiration of others.
  None of the answer choices accurately reflect Beecher's point.
Criticism:
  The question asks about Beecher's point in Passage 1, but the discussion about women's status is not the main focus of that passage.
  It is possible that the answer is supposed to be "none of the above", since none of the answer choices accurately reflect the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the duties and influence of women in society.
  Passage 2 suggests that sex does not determine moral rights or responsibilities.
A: The passage does not state that women depend on men for their safety and security.
B: The passage suggests that while women hold a subordinate relation to men in society, their duties and influence are equally important and all-pervading. However, this is not the point made by Beecher.
C: The passage does not mention women having fewer rights or responsibilities than men.
D: The passage does not suggest that women are superior to men or that tradition requires women to obey men.
Thought:
  Passage 1 and Beecher’s response in Passage 2 both talk about the status of women in society.
  Passage 1 suggests that women have an important role, but a subordinate relation to men.
  The passage does not suggest that women are inferior to men or that men have a higher status.
  None of the answer choices accurately reflect the point made in Passage 1.
  Answer ("None of the Above").
Criticism:
  While it is true that none of the answer choices accurately reflect the point made in Passage 1, the question asks specifically about Beecher's point regarding the status of women relative to men, not the point made in Passage 1.
  The answer could possibly be B, as it suggests that Beecher sees women as inferior to men but equally significant in terms of their role and influence.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.
Question: Which choice best describes the ways that the two authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society?
Choices:
  A: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.
  B: Tocqueville believes that an individual's economic class should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that class is not a legitimate consideration.
  C: Tocqueville believes that an individual's temperament should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that temperament should not be a factor in an individual's position.
  D: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by what is most beneficial to society, while Mill believes it should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding. 41
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The two authors believe in equality, but they approach it in different ways.
  Tocqueville believes that men and women are different and should have different "tasks".
  Mill believes that everyone should have equal opportunities regardless of gender or class.
Thought: 
  Both authors advocate for equality, but Tocqueville seems to believe that an individual's position in society should be determined by their sex and their corresponding "task", while Mill believes that an individual's abilities and interests should be the main factors in determining their position.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.
Criticism: 
  The description of Tocqueville's beliefs is accurate, but the description of Mill's beliefs is not entirely correct. While Mill does believe that everyone should have equal opportunities regardless of gender or class, he also believes that an individual's social position may be influenced by other factors such as temperament and interests.
  Therefore, while A is a better answer than B, C, or D, it is not a completely accurate description of Mill's beliefs.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The two authors are Tocqueville and Mill.
  Tocqueville believes that the social changes brought about by democracy will bring women closer to the same level as men, but he is critical of those who want to make men and women alike. He believes that men and women have different characteristics and should have different employment opportunities.
  Mill believes that each individual should have complete liberty of choice, and should be able to pursue the largest and highest sphere of activity that they are able to. He argues against arbitrary limits on what an individual of a certain sex or class can do, and believes that employments should fall into the hands of those who are most capable of exercising them.
Thought:
  Tocqueville and Mill both advocate for equality between individuals in society.
  Tocqueville believes that women should be raised and made more equal to men, but he also believes that men and women have different characteristics and that each should be assigned tasks that utilize their respective faculties.
  Mill believes that each individual should be free to pursue the largest and highest sphere of activity that they are able to, and that employment opportunities should be open to all.
  Neither author seems to argue that an individual's position in society should be determined by their sex, economic class, or temperament.
  Therefore, the best choice is D: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by what is most beneficial to society, while Mill believes it should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding. 
Criticism:
  The thought is correct and supported by evidence and knowledge from the passages.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passages discuss the ideas of democracy and equality in society, particularly as it relates to gender relations.
  Tocqueville discusses the ways in which democracy can improve gender equality in society while preserving the unique roles and abilities of men and women.
  Mill argues that individual freedom and ability, not gender or class, should determine a person's position in society.
Thought:
  Tocqueville believes that gender differences should be acknowledged in society, but that women should be given equal rights and opportunities as men.
  Mill believes that individual ability and freedom is more important than gender or class in determining one's position in society.
  Therefore, both authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society as one that values individual ability and equality.
  The answer is D: Tocqueville and Mill both believe that an individual's position in society should be determined by principles of equality and individual worth, not by factors such as gender or economic class.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the passages to support choice A, B, or C.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Tocqueville discusses social changes that promote equality and raise women's status in society, but he warns against blurring the differences between men and women and making them exactly alike.
  Mill argues that people should be free to choose their own occupations and that society should not impose arbitrary limits on what an individual can do based on sex or class.
Thought:
  Tocqueville thinks that men and women have different characteristics, and that nature provides distinct functions for each. He believes that improving society does not mean making the sexes pretty nearly do the same things, but rather getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. In contrast, Mill believes that there should be complete liberty of choice in occupations for all people without arbitrary limits based on sex or class. The best faculties of all individuals should be used to benefit society.
  Both authors advocate for a more just and equal society, but Tocqueville believes that differences between men and women exist for a reason and should not be ignored, whereas Mill thinks that society should not impose arbitrary limitations on individuals based on sex or class. 
Therefore, the best choice is A: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage contains two authors, Tocqueville and Mill.
  Tocqueville believes society modifies social inequalities and ultimately affects the inequality between men and women by raising women to be more equal to men but not the same as men.
  The Americans apply the principle of political economy by dividing the duties of man and woman, in order that the great work of society may be better carried out.
  Mill believes that society is gradually moving towards equality, in which people are judged based on their abilities rather than their class and gender.
  Mill believes that each individual should have complete liberty of choice, and every occupation should be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any.

  Mill believes that society is gradually moving towards equality, in which people are judged based on their abilities rather than their class and gender.
  Mill believes that each individual should have complete liberty of choice, and every occupation should be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any.
  Tocqueville seems to view the position of an individual in society based on their gender and roles they fulfill while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should determine their position in society.
  Therefore, A and B are not correct.
  C cannot be correct because it inaccurately suggests that Tocqueville's conception of temperament determines one's position in society.
  D accurately captures the main ideas of both authors. They both believe that society should encourage individuals to fulfill their potential and contribute to society in the best way possible. Thus, Answer("D") is the correct answer. 
Criticism:
  There is some truth that Tocqueville believes gender roles should shape an individual's position in society, at least in terms of women and their role in society. However, it is not a full or accurate portrayal of Tocqueville's stance since he also acknowledges that social changes will raise women's equality with men. 
  Therefore, Answer("D") may not be the most accurate. However, it is the best answer among the choices listed given the lack of more accurate options.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The two passages talk about how democracy affects different inequalities in society, including gender inequality.
  Tocqueville believes that women and men have distinct roles and that the improvement of society lies in fulfilling these respective tasks in the best possible manner.
  Mill believes that individuals should be free to choose their occupations and that society should not limit anyone based on their sex or class.
Thought: 
  Tocqueville believes that men and women have different roles and that social changes should make women more equal to men, but still uphold their distinct functions.
  Mill believes that people should have complete liberty of choice in their occupations without favor or discouragement based on their sex or class.
  Therefore, Tocqueville sees an individual's proper position in society as being defined in part by their sex, while Mill sees individual abilities and freedom of choice as the determining factors.
  The best answer is A: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.
Criticism: 
  The statement that Tocqueville believes that one's position in society should be "defined in important ways by that individual's sex" is an oversimplification of his views.
  While Tocqueville does believe that men and women have distinct roles, he also believes that individuals should have equal rights and opportunities, and that social changes can help to bring women closer to equality with men.
  Additionally, Mill's view can be more accurately described not just in terms of individual abilities, but in terms of individuals having the freedom to develop and express their abilities without artificial limitations based on their sex or class.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Tocqueville and Mill are two authors who are writing about the idea of equality in society.
  Tocqueville discusses the idea that democracy has the potential to change the traditional inequalities in society, including those between men and women.
  He suggests that men and women have different roles to play in society, and that recognizing and respecting these differences is important.
  Mill, on the other hand, believes in the importance of individual liberty and the right of each person to determine their own path in life, regardless of their sex or other characteristics.
Thought: 
  Tocqueville and Mill have different ideas about the individual's proper position in society.
  Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined, at least in part, by their sex and the tasks that they are best suited to perform.
  Mill, on the other hand, believes that an individual's abilities and interests should be the determining factor in their position.
  Therefore, choice A, which describes Tocqueville as focused on an individual's sex and Mill as focused on abilities, is the most accurate answer.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage contains two authors, Tocqueville and Mill, who discuss the subject of equality between men and women in society.
  Tocqueville believes that the social changes will make women more and more the equal of men.
  Tocqueville and Mill both argue that people should be able to pursue occupations for which they have the greatest aptitude and they should have complete liberty of choice.
Thought:
  Tocqueville and Mill both agree that society should evolve towards greater equality among its members.
  Tocqueville thinks that greater equality will benefit women who will increasingly become equal to men.
  Mill argues that people should have complete liberty of choice and opportunities to pursue the largest and highest sphere for which they have the ability.
  Therefore, Tocqueville believes an individual's position should be determined by social changes, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities and interests should determine their position.
  The answer is D.
Criticism:
  The choices are clear and distinct.
  Tocqueville does not believe that an individual's sex, economic class, or temperament should determine an individual's position in society.
  Mill does not believe that an individual's position should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding.
Action: Answer("D")

  Mill believes that everyone should have the liberty to choose their own occupation, without favor or discouragement based on sex or class.
Thought:
  Both authors are advocating for greater equality in society.
  However, Tocqueville is focused mainly on the status of women and the potential danger of trying to make men and women too much alike.
  Mill, on the other hand, is advocating for individual liberty in choosing one's occupation, without regard to sex or class.
  Therefore, the best choice is D: Tocqueville believes an individual's position should be determined by what is most beneficial to society, while Mill believes it should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding. 
Criticism: 
  The actual answer is not among the choices.
  Both authors believe in greater individual liberty and equality in society, but they focus on different factors that should determine an individual's position.
  Tocqueville believes that women should have more opportunities, but warns against trying to make men and women exactly alike.
  Mill believes that everyone should have the liberty to choose of their own occupation, without favor or discouragement based on sex or class.

Topic: English
Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, in studying the Venus flytrap, Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of which type of evidence?
Choices:
  A: Mathematical models to predict the electrical charge required to close the Venus flytrap
  B: Analysis of data collected from previous researchers' work involving the Venus flytrap's response to electricity
  C: Information obtained from monitoring the Venus flytrap's response to varying amounts of electrical current
  D: Published theories of scientists who developed earlier models of the Venus flytrap
Response 0:

Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect

Choices:
  A: remnants of differentiated asteroids that were destroyed in collisions in the asteroid belt.
  B: created relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.
  C: formed on terrestrial planets and ejected into the asteroid belt by collisions with primitive asteroids.
  D: formed in the region of the terrestrial planets but knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions with the parent bodies of primitive asteroids.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" and the fact that iron meteorites are more likely to survive than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart. 
  Bottke and his colleagues propose a possible explanation for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
  A: This choice is incorrect because it describes remnants of differentiated asteroids, which are discussed earlier in the passage but are not the main focus of Bottke's explanation.
  B: This choice accurately summarizes Bottke's proposal that the parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravitational perturbations of larger objects.
  C: This choice is incorrect because it refers to the formation of fragments on terrestrial planets rather than their parent bodies.
  D: This choice is similar to B but suggests that fragments from the region of the terrestrial planets were knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions with the parent bodies of primitive asteroids. This idea is not mentioned in the passage. 
Thought: 
  Bottke and his colleagues suggest that iron fragments in the asteroid belt were originally part of parent bodies that formed closer to the Sun and were scattered into the asteroid belt due to gravitational perturbations of larger objects.
  Therefore, the answer is B: created relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct according to the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:

  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem", which refers to the rarity of finding mantle rocks in meteorite collections and in the asteroid belt.
  Iron fragments have been found in the asteroid belt, but mantle rocks are rare.
  The passage discusses possible reasons why iron fragments have survived better than rocky fragments.
  William Bottke and his colleagues have a proposed explanation for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
Thought: 
  According to the passage, Bottke and his colleagues explain the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt by asserting that fragments are remnants of differentiated asteroids that formed closer to the Sun and were disrupted by collisions. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: created relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of Bottke and his colleagues asserting that fragments were ejected into the asteroid belt by collisions with primitive asteroids (C) or knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions with the parent bodies of primitive asteroids (D).
  While A is partially correct in that differentiated asteroids were disrupted by collisions in the asteroid belt, the passage specifically cites Bottke and his colleagues' explanation of the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt as being due to their formation closer to the Sun and their arrival in the asteroid belt due to gravitational perturbations from larger objects.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the 'missing mantle problem' and the survival rate of iron versus rocky fragments when asteroids break apart.
  Bottke and colleagues come up with a possible explanation for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt. 
  A: Remnants of differentiated asteroids that were destroyed in collisions in the asteroid belt is discussed as a possibility for the missing mantle problem, but not what Bottke and colleagues explain. 
  B: Bottke and his colleagues propose that the iron fragments formed closer to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects. 
  C: The passage does not discuss the formation of iron fragments on terrestrial planets nor ejections into the asteroid belt by collisions with primitive asteroids. 
  D: This is a possible explanation similar to what Bottke and colleagues propose, but the fragments are formed in the region of the terrestrial planets. 
Thought: 
  Bottke and his colleagues explain the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
  They suggest that the iron fragments were formed closer to the Sun.
  Due to tighter packing nearer the Sun, there would have been more frequent collisions leading to fragmentation of bodies. 
  As a result, both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt from the region of the Sun.
  However, only stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system. 
  Therefore, Bottke and colleagues explain the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt as remnants of objects formed closer to the Sun, that have survived longer in space than rocky fragments.
  The answer is B: created relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.

  Bottke and his colleagues propose an explanation for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
Thought:
  Bottke and his colleagues propose that the iron fragments in the asteroid belt were formed closer to the Sun, where collisions were more frequent.
  Objects were more tightly packed closer to the Sun, increasing the frequency of collisions, which caused differentiated bodies to be destroyed and their fragments to be scattered into the asteroid belt.
  Both iron and rocky fragments were present, but only the stronger iron fragments survived.
  Parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt, and most of these objects survived.
  Therefore, Bottke and his colleagues explain the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt by asserting that the fragments were created relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.
  The answer is B: created relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.
Criticism:
  There is no information in the passage to suggest that the iron fragments were remnants of differentiated asteroids that were destroyed in collisions in the asteroid belt (option A) or that rocky fragments were ejected into the asteroid belt by collisions with primitive asteroids (option C).

  C: The passage does not mention anything about the formation and ejection of fragments from terrestrial planets into the asteroid belt.
  D: The passage suggests that Bottke and his colleagues’ possible explanation is that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites were formed in the region of the terrestrial planets and were knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions with the parent bodies of primitive meteorites.
Thought: 
  According to the passage, Bottke and his colleagues suggest that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun and were knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions with the parent bodies of primitive meteorites. These collisions would have scattered fragments of iron and rocky material into the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects could have survived. Therefore, the answer is B: created relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.
Criticism: 
  There is no information in the passage that fully confirms Bottke and his colleagues' possible explanation concerning the formation of the parent bodies of the iron meteorites. The answer might still be incorrect.
Action: Answer("B")

Context: \section{Passage 1}Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together, to a house divided against itself, and says that it is  contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.When did he learn, and by what authority does he proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased fromfour millions to thirty millions of people; we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population,in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under aConstitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says isin violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government....I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of eachState to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-boundRepublic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire newterritory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just 45 as fast and as far as we need the territory... .\section{Passage 2}In complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship ... he again quotes that portion in which I said that "a house divided 50 against itself cannot stand." Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face55 of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate60 the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the65 house a "house divided against itself." They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?70 Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has75 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
Question: Both passages discuss the issue of slavery in relationship to
Choices:
  A: the expansion of the Union.
  B: questions of morality.
  C: religious toleration.
  D: laws regulating commerce.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the issue of slavery in relation to the survival of the Union and expanding the country.
  Passage 2 discusses the issue of slavery in relation to the unity of the Union, the causes of conflict, and efforts to spread it into new territories.
Thought:
  Both passages discuss the issue of slavery in relation to the Union, but they approach the topic from different perspectives.
  Passage 1 focuses on the survival of the Union and territorial expansion as the main reasons for preserving the institution of slavery, while Passage 2 argues that slavery is the cause of division and conflict in the Union and that limiting its expansion would promote peace.
  Neither passage discusses the issue of slavery in relation to religious toleration or laws regulating commerce.
  The best answer is A: the expansion of the Union. 
Criticism: 
  The answer A is not fully correct as both passages mention slavery and its relationship to the Union. However, the better option is to choose the most broadly applicable category that applies to both passages. While both passages do discuss slavery in relation to the Union, Passage 1 specifically links slavery with the expansion of the Union and Passage 2 implies that limiting the spread of slavery would help maintain the unity of the existing Union. Therefore, A is still the most appropriate answer compared to the other options. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 both discuss the issue of slavery.
  Passage 1 discusses the idea of whether the Union can exist forever divided into Free and Slave states.
  Passage 2 discusses the concept of a "house divided against itself" and argues that all of the features that make each state unique are the very cements of the Union, but slavery produces quarrels and difficulties.
  A: Passage 1 talks about the expansion of the Union, but that is not the main focus of the discussion of slavery in the passage.
  B: Passage 1 talks briefly about questions of morality in relation to Mr. Lincoln's argument, but it is not the main focus of the passage.
  C: Passage 1 briefly mentions the law of God, but does not discuss religious toleration in relation to slavery.
  D: Neither passage discusses laws regulating commerce in relation to slavery.
Thought: 
  Both passages discuss the issue of slavery, with Passage 1 focusing on whether the Union can exist divided into Free and Slave states, and Passage 2 discussing the idea of a "house divided against itself" and arguing that slavery has always produced quarrels and difficulties.
  Neither passage discusses the expansion of the Union, questions of morality beyond briefly mentioning the law of God in Passage 1, or laws regulating commerce.
  The most accurate answer is either A or B, but A is less directly related to the topic of slavery.
  Therefore, the answer is B: questions of morality.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that both passages discuss the issue of slavery and that questions of morality are a common theme.
  However, Passage 1 focuses more on the question of whether the Union can exist divided into Free and Slave states while Passage 2 examines the concept of a "house divided against itself."
  So, one could argue that A: the expansion of the Union is also relevant to the discussion in Passage 1.
  However, as neither passage discusses religious toleration or laws regulating commerce, the answer cannot be C or D.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the idea of the Union existing with Free and Slave States and argues that it can exist if each State carries out its principles. It also talks about the need for expansion to give the people land to live upon.
  Passage 2 discusses the idea of the Union being divided by the issue of slavery and how it has caused quarrels and difficulties. It argues that the element of slavery is unlike other differences in the States and that there has been peace when it has been limited to its present bounds.
Thought: 
  Both passages discuss the issue of slavery in relationship to the expansion of the Union.
  Passage 1 argues that the Union can exist with Free and Slave States if each State carries out its principles, which includes the expansion to give the people land to live upon.
  Passage 2 argues that the Union has had peace when slavery has been limited to its present bounds and that difficulties have arisen when there have been efforts to spread it over more territory.
  Both passages reference the idea of the Union as a "house divided against itself."
  Therefore, the answer is A: the expansion of the Union.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The two passages both mention the issue of slavery.
  Passage 1 discusses the idea of a "House divided" and whether the Union can exist with Free and Slave States.
  Passage 2 discusses the causes of difficulty and quarrels over slavery, and the relationship between the spread of slavery and peace or conflict.
  A: Expansion of the Union is mentioned in Passage 1, but is not the main focus of either passage.
  B: Questions of morality are mentioned in Passage 1, where Lincoln refers to the law of God, but are not the main focus of either passage.
  C: Religious toleration is not mentioned in either passage.
  D: Laws regulating commerce are briefly mentioned in Passage 2, but are not the main focus of either passage.
Thought: 
  Both passages address the issue of slavery in the United States, but in different contexts.
  Passage 1 is more focused on the question of whether the Union can continue with both Free and Slave States, while Passage 2 is focused on the causes of difficulties and conflicts related to slavery.
  Neither passage is primarily focused on issues of expansion, morality, religious toleration, or commerce.
  Therefore, the best answer is "None of the Above."
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses whether the Union can exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States.
  The passage argues that if each state just acts upon the principle of State rights and sovereignty by regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, then the Union can exist indefinitely, and even expand.
  Passage 2 discusses the issue of slavery in relation to the stability of the Union.
  The passage argues that slavery has been a source of quarrels and difficulties, which has produced trouble and convulsion. 
Thought:
  Both passages discuss the issue of slavery. 
  Passage 1 discusses whether the Union can exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, while Passage 2 discusses the effect of slavery on the stability of the Union. 
  Therefore, both passages discuss the issue of slavery in relationship to the expansion and stability of the Union. 
  The answer is A: the expansion of the Union.
Criticism: 
  The answer could be argued for B: questions of morality, as Passage 1 mentions that Mr. Lincoln calls the bond of the Federal Constitution joining Free and Slave States together contrary to the law of God. 
  However, even in this passage, the focus is on whether the Union can exist indefinitely with this division. 
  Therefore, A: the expansion of the Union appears to be a more directly relevant and consistent answer. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the ability of the Union to exist while divided into Free and Slave States and asserts that it can exist if each State carries out their business without meddling in that of their neighbors.
  Passage 2 contrasts the issue of slavery with other differences among the States (such as laws regarding commerce) and argues that the slavery issue has caused difficulties.
Thought: 
  Both passages discuss the issue of slavery in relationship to the Union.
  Passage 1 argues that the Union can exist while divided into Free and Slave States as long as each State follows State Rights principles and carries out their business without meddling in that of their neighbors.
  Passage 2 argues that slavery is an issue that has caused difficulties and has led to trouble and convulsion whenever there are efforts to spread it over new territory.
  Therefore, the issue of slavery is discussed in relationship to A) the expansion of the Union.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the issue of slavery in the context of the Union's ability to stand divided into Free and Slave States, and argues that the Union can continue to exist so long as each state is allowed to govern itself as it sees fit.
  Passage 2 also discusses the issue of slavery, but focuses on the conflict it has caused and argues that the Union cannot remain permanently divided on the issue.
  A: Expansion of the Union is mentioned in Passage 1 as a reason why new territories may need to be acquired.
  B: Questions of morality are indirectly referenced in both passages, but Passage 1 is primarily focused on the practicalities of the Union's survival while Passage 2 is focused on the impact of slavery on national unity.
  C: Religious toleration is not mentioned in either passage.
  D: Laws regulating commerce are mentioned in Passage 2 as an example of how different state institutions and laws have not caused conflict in the past.
Thought: 
  Both passages address the issue of slavery and its relationship to the Union.
  Passage 1 argues for allowing each state to govern itself as the key to the Union's survival.
  Passage 2 focuses on the divisive impact of slavery on national unity and argues that the Union cannot remain permanently divided on the issue.
  Neither passage mentions the issue of religious toleration or laws regulating commerce as directly relevant to the discussion of slavery and the Union.
  Thus, the answer is A: the expansion of the Union.
Criticism:
  Your answer is partly correct, but it does not fully capture the nuances of the passages. While Passage 1 does suggest that expansion of the Union may require the acquisition of new territories, the main focus of both passages is on the issue of slavery and its relationship to the Union's survival and/or cohesion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the issue of slavery in relation to the Union's ability to stand divided between free and slave states, arguing that it can survive if each state adheres to the principle of state sovereignty.
  Passage 2 also discusses the issue of slavery in relation to the Union's ability to stand united and argues that the element of slavery is what divides the house and produces quarrels.
  A: The expansion of the Union is discussed in Passage 1, but it is not the central focus of either passage.
  B: Questions of morality are briefly mentioned in Passage 1 when Lincoln refers to the bond of the Federal Constitution as "contrary to the law of God", and in Passage 2 when the issue of slavery is discussed as a moral issue. However, this is not the central focus of either passage.
  C: Religious toleration is not mentioned in either passage.
  D: Laws regulating commerce are briefly mentioned in Passage 2 as an example of state-specific institutions that do not produce conflict in the Union; however, this is not the central focus of either passage.
Thought: 
  Both passages focus on the issue of slavery in relation to the Union's ability to stand united and expand.
  Passage 1 argues that the Union can survive if each state adheres to the principle of state sovereignty.
  Passage 2 argues that slavery is the main cause of division in the Union and that efforts to spread it into new territories cause trouble.
  Therefore, the issue of slavery is discussed in relation to the expansion and unity of the Union.
  The answer is A: the expansion of the Union.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the issue of slavery is discussed in both passages in relation to the Union's ability to stand united and expand, but the more specific focus is on the division caused by slavery. 
  Therefore, it is possible that the answer could be either A or B. 
Action: Answer("A or B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the Free and Slave states divide and the ability of the Union to stand with that divide.
  Passage 2 discusses the issue of slavery and its relation to difficulties and quarrels in the Union. 
  A: Passage 1 discusses the expansion of the Union, but there is no mention of it in Passage 2 in relation to slavery or any other topic.
  B: Passage 2 discusses the morality of slavery and its impact on the Union.
  C: There is no mention of religious tolerance in either passage.
  D: Passage 2 mentions Louisiana’s laws regulating commerce regarding sugar and flour, but it does not connect those laws to the issue of slavery, which is the main topic in both passages.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."
Question: What does the author imply about pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation?
Choices:
  A: They communicate with each other in the same way as do ibises.
  B: They have the same migration routes as those of ibises.
  C: They create a similar wake to that of ibises.
  D: They expend more energy than do ibises.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses how migrating birds fly in a V formation to potentially save energy during flight by catching the updraft created by the previous bird.
  The study focused on ibises and how they carefully position their wingtips and sync their flapping in a V formation to save energy.
  The author mentions that pelicans, storks, and geese are long-winged birds like ibises and may benefit from flying in a V formation.
Thought: 
  The author implies that pelicans, storks, and geese may also fly in a V formation to save energy during migration.
  The author specifically mentions that these birds are long-winged like ibises, so they may be similar in this regard.
  However, there is no mention that these birds communicate in the same way or have the same migration routes as ibises, nor is there any information about how much energy they expend compared to ibises.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is C: they create a similar wake to that of ibises.
Criticism: 
  The author discusses how long-winged birds like pelicans, storks, and geese may benefit from flying in a V formation, but does not explicitly state that they create a similar wake to that of ibises.
  However, given that the article focuses on the benefits of a V formation and mentions these birds specifically, it is reasonable to assume that they may create a similar wake.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The article describes how ibises synchronize their flight to save energy by catching updrafts from the preceding bird, and save energy by flying in a V formation.
  The article suggests that other long-winged birds, like pelicans, storks, and geese, likely fly in a similar V formation and may conserve energy in the same way as ibises.
Thought:
  The article suggests that pelicans, storks, and geese likely fly in a V formation to conserve energy, and may catch updrafts by positioning their wings in a similar way to ibises.
  The article does not provide information on how these birds communicate with each other during flight or whether they have the same migration routes as ibises.
  There is no mention in the article that these birds expend more energy than ibises.

Response 3:
Knowledge: The article discusses how ibises fly in V formation to save energy during migration. The study suggests that pelicans, storks, and geese also fly in V formation to conserve energy in the same way as ibises.
A: The article does not mention how pelicans, storks, and geese communicate with each other during migration. This option is not relevant to the article or the passage.
B: The article does not mention whether pelicans, storks, and geese have the same migration routes as ibises. This option is not relevant to the article or the passage.
C: The article suggests that pelicans, storks, and geese create a similar wake to that of ibises and they fly in V formation to conserve energy. Therefore, this option is correct.
D: The article suggests that pelicans, storks, and geese fly in V formation to conserve energy in the same way as ibises. Therefore, they should expend the same or similar amount of energy as ibises, and this option is incorrect.
Thought: 
  The article suggests that pelicans, storks, and geese, like ibises, fly in V formation to conserve energy.
  The author also states that "The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese."
  Therefore, the statement that pelicans, storks, and geese create a similar wake to that of ibises, and thus fly in V formation to conserve energy, is true.
  The answer is C: They create a similar wake to that of ibises.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence to suggest that pelicans, storks, and geese migrate on the same routes as ibises, so option B is incorrect. 
  The article does not provide information on how pelicans, storks, and geese communicate with each other during migration, so option A is incorrect.
  The article suggests that pelicans, storks and geese save energy by flying in V formation, so option D is incorrect.

Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses a study of ibises that fly in a V-formation to save energy during flight.
  The study found that the birds position their wingtips and sync their flapping to catch the preceding bird's updraft and minimize the effects of downdrafts.
  Pelicans, storks, and geese are also long-winged birds that fly in a V-formation.
Thought: 
  The article suggests that the findings about ibises likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese.
  These birds may also fly in a V-formation to save energy during flight by catching uplifting eddies.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that pelicans, storks, and geese create a similar wake to that of ibises, which allows them to save energy in a similar way.
  The answer is C: They create a similar wake to that of ibises.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the article to support answer choices A, B, or D.
  The article suggests that pelicans, storks, and geese may fly in a V-formation to save energy, but it does not provide any information about their communication or migration routes.
  Additionally, the article does not compare the energy expenditure of these birds to that of ibises.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses a study of ibises and their flight patterns, specifically their use of a V formation.
- The passage notes that the researchers believe ibises save energy by drafting off each other in the V formation.
- The passage also notes that the researchers believe pelicans, storks, and geese likely fly in a similar V formation, but that smaller birds have more complex wakes that make drafting too difficult.
Thought:
- The passage notes that pelicans, storks, and geese likely fly in a V formation similar to that of ibises.
- The passage also notes that smaller birds create more complex wakes, suggesting that larger birds like pelicans, storks, and geese likely do not have this issue.
- The passage does not mention communication among these birds or their migration routes.
- Therefore, the author implies that pelicans, storks, and geese create a similar wake to that of ibises when flying in a V formation.
- The answer is C: They create a similar wake to that of ibises.
Criticism:
- There is no mention of communication among these birds, so it is incorrect to choose A.
- There is no mention of migration routes, so it is incorrect to choose B.
- The passage suggests that smaller birds create more complex wakes that make drafting too difficult, but it does not mention whether larger birds expend more or less energy than ibises, so it is incorrect to choose D.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses a new study of ibises to determine why birds fly in a V formation and whether it saves energy during flight.
  Pelicans, storks, and geese are also mentioned in the article as long-winged birds that may fly in a V formation.
Thought: 
  The article implies that pelicans, storks, and geese may fly in a V formation.
  It doesn't seem to suggest they communicate with each other in the same way as ibises.
  The article also doesn't provide any information as to whether they have the same migration routes as ibises.
  The article does suggest that they create wakes that are complex.
  Therefore, the answer is C: They create a similar wake to that of ibises. 
Criticism: 
  You are right that the article does not provide any information about whether pelicans, storks, and geese communicate with each other in the same way as ibises.
  Also, the article does not specify if these birds have the same migration routes as do ibises.
  However, you are correct that the article suggests that pelicans, storks, and geese create a similar wake to that of ibises.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses research on ibises and how they fly in V formation to save energy during migration. 
  The article mentions that other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, are likely to create similar uplifting eddies that would make it possible for them to fly in a V formation to save energy.
Thought:
  The article suggests that pelicans, storks, and geese are other long-winged birds that may be able to fly in a V formation to save energy during migration.
  These birds are likely to create similar uplifting eddies that allow them to draft off each other and conserve energy during flight, just like ibises.
  The article does not say anything about the communication, migration routes or energy expenditure of these birds in comparison to ibises.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: They create a similar wake to that of ibises.
Criticism:
  There is no information in the passage that directly states that pelicans, storks, and geese create eddies similar to those of ibises. 
  However, it is suggested, so the answer is the most likely one.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.
Question: Based on the passages, both authors would agree with which of the following claims?
Choices:
  A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
  B: Men often work selflessly for political change.
  C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.
  D: Political activism is as important for women as it is for men.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1: Discusses the role of women in society and how they should use their power and influence.
  Passage 2: Discusses human rights and equality between genders and races.
Thought:
  Both passages emphasize the importance of individuals understanding their moral responsibilities and treating others with respect.
  The authors of both passages seem to value women's roles in society and believe that they should be treated fairly.
  Although neither passage directly discusses political activism, both authors emphasize the importance of treating others with respect and dignity.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
Criticism:
  While the authors of both passages do emphasize moral duties and responsibilities, it is not clear that this is their main point of agreement.
  Additionally, the passages do not provide enough information to support any of the other answer choices.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 explains that women have an important role in society, but it is different from men's roles. Women should exercise power in a peaceful and benevolent way, within the domestic and social circle.
  Passage 2 argues that human beings have rights because they are moral beings, and men and women have essentially the same rights. The author believes that whatever is morally right for man to do, it is also morally right for woman to do.
Thought: 
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 both recognize that women have moral duties and responsibilities. 
  Passage 1 emphasizes the importance of women's power within the domestic and social circle, while passage 2 argues that men and women have essentially the same rights and duties. 
  Therefore, both authors would agree with the claim that women have moral duties and responsibilities.
  The answer is A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
Criticism: 
  The answer is correct. The passages do not mention men's selflessness for political change or the undervaluation of women's ethical obligations nor do they suggest that political activism is as important for women as it is for men. 
  The other options mentioned are irrelevant to the content of the passages.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 is about the role of women in society and the ways in which they can gain influence and power.
  Passage 2 is about the anti-slavery movement and the moral nature of human beings.
  Both passages suggest that women have moral duties and responsibilities.
Thought:
  In Passage 1, the author argues that women have an important but different kind of power than men, and that they should use their influence in peaceful and benevolent ways.
  In Passage 2, the author argues that human beings have rights because they are moral beings, and that sex does not determine rights and responsibilities.
  Both authors agree that women have, or should have, moral duties and responsibilities that are not determined by their sex.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that women hold a subordinate position in society but that their influence is still important, although it should be achieved through different means than men. 
  Passage 2 argues that the investigation of the rights of slaves has led the author to a better understanding and appreciation of women's rights and that the moral principles behind human rights do not differentiate between sexes. 
Thought:
  Both passages advocate for the recognition of women's moral obligations and duties. 
  Both passages do not claim that men work selflessly for political change explicitly, but Passage 1 does mention the power of public debate, fear, and personal interest as sources of motivation for men.
  Passage 2 does not make any direct claims about undervaluing women's ethical obligations, although this could be inferred from the argument that women's rights and responsibilities are just as important as men's.
  Neither passage talks about political activism specifically, although it could be a logical extension of the arguments about recognizing women's moral duties and rights.
  Based on the above analysis, it seems that the best answer is A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1: Considers the social roles of women, affirms the importance of female duties and influence, and insists on the peaceful nature of women's power. It opposes the idea of women's participation in "combatant" social movements.
  Passage 2: Discusses the nature of human rights and argues that women have the same moral nature as men.
Thought: 
  Both passages acknowledge that women have moral duties and responsibilities. In passage 1, the importance of women's duties and influence is emphasized, albeit in a non-political context. In passage 2, it is argued that women have the same moral nature as men and therefore possess the same rights.
  Neither passage suggests that men work selflessly for political change or that the ethical obligations of women are undervalued. Neither passage argues that political activism is as important for women as it is for men.
  The best answer is: A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
Criticism: 
  Nothing in either passage suggests that either author believes men work selflessly for political change, or that they don't already accept women's ethical obligations. Therefore, A is the most general and correct choice, but it is not a specific conclusion of one of the passages.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the position of women in society and their modes of gaining influence and exercising power.
  Passage 2 suggests that human rights are based on moral nature, and that sex does not determine moral rights and responsibilities.
Thought: 
  Both passages discuss the duties, responsibilities, and rights of women. Passage 1 suggests that women have important duties and influence but should use different modes of power. Passage 2 argues that women have the same moral nature as men and therefore have the same rights and responsibilities. Both passages agree that women have moral duties and obligations
  Therefore, the answer is A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of men working selflessly for political change in either passage, nor of women's ethical obligations being undervalued. Passage 2 argues that the sex of an individual does not determine moral rights and responsibilities, but it does not imply that political activism is as important for women as for men. 
  However, both passages do agree that women have moral duties and responsibilities, so A is still the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1: Discusses the role of women in society and how they can gain influence and power by adhering to principles of kindness, gentleness, and benevolence rather than coercion or physical force. It does not make any claims about men's selflessness or political activism.
  Passage 2: Discusses the author's understanding of human rights and how they apply to women, arguing that women have the same rights and responsibilities as men and that their moral duties are equal to those of men. It does not directly address men's selflessness or political activism, or whether political activism is as important for women as for men.
Thought: 
  Both passages discuss women's moral duties and responsibilities and argue that they are equal in importance to men's. Therefore, both passages would agree with the claim that women have moral duties and responsibilities. 
  The passages do not address the other claims, as they do not provide information about men's selflessness or political activism, or whether political activism is as important for women as men.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
Criticism: 
  You are correct in your analysis that both passages emphasize the importance of women's moral duties and responsibilities.
  However, the passages do not directly address the other claims listed in the question.
  So, the answer could have potential issues of relevance as it is not a direct claim from both passages.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 talks about the role of women in society and their mode of gaining influence and exercising power.
  Passage 2 talks about the rights of slaves and the rights of women.
  A: Both passages discuss the moral duties and responsibilities of women.
  B: Passage 1 does not discuss men working selflessly for political change, and Passage 2 discusses the rights of slaves and women, not men's actions.
  C: Passage 2 suggests that women's rights are often overlooked, but Passage 1 does not specifically discuss women's ethical obligations being undervalued.
  D: Neither passage mentions political activism or makes a direct comparison between political activism for men and women.
Thought: 
  Both passages put forth an argument that humans have rights based on their moral nature. 
  Passage 2 argues that the mere circumstance of sex does not give men higher rights and responsibilities than women, suggesting that women have equal moral duties and responsibilities.
  Passage 1 talks about the power and influence that women can have in society, but it does not specifically mention political activism.
  Therefore, both authors would agree with the claim that women have moral duties and responsibilities.
  The answer is A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that both passages discuss the moral responsibilities of women. 
  However, the passages do not mention men working selflessly for political change, women's ethical obligations being undervalued, or political activism being as important for women as for men.
  So, the correct answer is A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  In Passage 1: The author argues that women hold a subordinate position in society to men, but this does not mean that their duties or influence are any less important. Men and women have different ways of gaining influence and exercising power.
  In Passage 2: The author argues that human rights are based on moral nature, and since men and women have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. Whatever is morally right for men to do, is morally right for women to do. 
Thought:
  Both authors believe that women have moral duties and responsibilities. In Passage 1, the author argues that women have important duties and influence in society, but they have different ways of gaining influence and power. In Passage 2, the author argues that women have the same moral nature and rights as men, and thus they have the same moral duties and responsibilities. Therefore, both would agree that women have ethical obligations in society.
  Men working selflessly for political change is not a claim that both authors would agree with. Passage 1 mentions the ways in which men exert power, but it doesn't mention selflessness or political change. Passage 2 doesn't address men's actions at all.
  While Passage 1 argues that women have important duties and influence in society, it doesn't address the issue of undervaluation of their ethical obligations. Similarly, Passage 2 does not specifically argue that the ethical obligations of women are undervalued.
  Although both authors argue that men and women have the same moral nature and rights, they do not explicitly say that political activism is as important for women as it is for men.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the subordinate role of women in society, and outlines how women can exercise their influence. It does not directly address the idea of moral duties or responsibilities.
  Passage 2 discusses the human rights of slaves and the author's belief that a person's moral nature gives them rights. The author argues that men and women have essentially the same rights, and that women should be able to do what is morally right.
Thought: 
  Both passages address gender roles and obligations.
  Passage 1 outlines what is expected of women, and how they should exercise power.
  Passage 2 argues that regardless of gender, all people have equal rights and obligations to do what is morally right.
  Both authors would likely agree that women have moral duties and responsibilities.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
Criticism: 
  There is no direct discussion of moral duties or responsibilities in Passage 1, so it is possible that the authors might not agree on this exact claim. 
  However, both passages do imply that women have obligations to contribute to society in some way.
  So, while it is not a perfect match, A is still the most reasonable choice based on the available information.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open

Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.
Question: Calma indicates that in the past, the Australiangovernment stressed which aspect of its relationshipto indigenous peoples?
Choices:
  A: The willingness it has shown to meet with indigenous leaders

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.The brains of humans are conspicuously larger than the.brains of other apes, but the human-specific genetic.factors responsible for the uniquely large human.neocortex remain obscure. Since humans split from.chimps, which have brains roughly a third of human size,.the human genome has undergone roughly 15 million.changes. Which of these genetic tweaks could have led to.big brains?.About six years ago, scientists in David Haussler’s lab at.Howard Hughes Medical Institute discovered a gene called.NOTCH2NL. It’s a relative of NOTCH2, a gene that.scientists knew was central to early brain development..NOTCH2 controls vital decisions regarding when and how.many neurons to make..When the Haussler team looked in the official version.of the human genome at that time^1 —version 37—.NOTCH2NL appeared to be located in chromosome 1.near a region linked to abnormal brain size. Delete a hunk.of the region, and brains tend to shrink. Duplicate part of.it, and brains tend to overgrow..“We thought, ‘Oh, this is incredible,’” Haussler said..NOTCH2NL seemed to check all the boxes for a key role.in human brain development. But when the team mapped.NOTCH2NL’s precise location in the genome, they.discovered the gene wasn’t actually in the relevant.chromosomal region after all; the once-promising.candidate seemed to be a dud..“We were downhearted,” Haussler recalled. That all.changed with the next official version of the human.genome—version 38. In this iteration, NOTCH2NL was.located in the crucial region. “And there were three.versions of it,” Haussler exclaimed. Over the last three.million years, his team calculated, NOTCH2NL was.repeatedly copy-pasted into the genome, what he calls “a.series of genetic accidents.”.Genetic analysis of several primate species revealed that.the three genes exist only in humans and their recent.relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, not in.chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. What’s more, the.timing of these genes’ emergence matches up with the.period in the fossil record when our ancestors’ craniums.began to enlarge, Haussler points out. Together, the results.suggest that NOTCH2NL genes played a role in beefing.up human brain size..Passage 2.Modern humans have brains that are more than three.times larger than our closest living relatives,.chimpanzees and bonobos. Scientists don’t agree on.when and how this dramatic increase took place, but.new analysis of 94 hominin fossils shows that average.brain size increased gradually and consistently over the.past three million years..The research, published in The Proceedings of the.Royal Society B, shows that the trend was caused.primarily by evolution of larger brains within.populations of individual species, but the introduction of.new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones also played a part..“Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that.makes us human. It’s related to cultural complexity,.language, tool making and all these other things that.make us unique,” said Andrew Du, PhD, a postdoctoral.scholar at the University of Chicago and first author of.the study. “The earliest hominins had brain sizes like.chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since.then. So, it’s important to understand how we got here.”.Du and his colleagues compared published research.data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13.different species, beginning with the earliest.unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3.2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including.Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size.began to overlap with that of modern-day humans..The researchers saw that when the species were.counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a.common ancestor, the average brain size increased.gradually over three million years. Looking more closely,.the increase was driven by three different factors,.primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within.individual species populations, but also by the addition.of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones..The study quantifies for the first time when and by.how much each of these factors contributes to the clade-.level pattern. Du said he likens it to how a football coach.might build a roster of bigger, strong players. One way.would be to make all the players hit the weight room to.bulk up. But the coach could also recruit new, larger.players and cut the smallest ones..(^1) The reference version of the human genome goes through updates to.more completely map out each chromosomal sequence.

  Your thoughts and the knowledge seems to be correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the discovery of the NOTCH2NL gene and how it may have played a role in human brain size evolution, and genetic analysis of several primate species showed that the gene only exists in humans and their recent relatives.
  Passage 2 discusses a new analysis of 94 hominin fossils that shows a gradual and consistent increase in average brain size over the past three million years, caused primarily by evolution of larger brains within populations of individual species, but also by the introduction of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-brained ones.
Thought: 
  Passage 1 focuses on genetic analysis of one key gene, NOTCH2NL, that is unique to humans and their recent relatives and may have played a role in brain size evolution. 
  Passage 2 discusses the results of a new analysis of 94 hominin fossils that shows a consistent increase in average brain size over three million years, primarily due to evolution of larger brains within populations of individual species. 
  Thus, the key difference between the passages is that Passage 1 focuses on small-scale genetic changes that influenced brain evolution, while Passage 2 focuses on the influence of large-scale population-level changes. 
  The answer is D: Passage 1 focuses on small-scale genetic changes that influenced brain evolution, while Passage 2 focuses on the influence of large-scale population-level changes.
Criticism: 
  Your thoughts and answer are correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Passage 1 discusses the role of specific genes in human brain development and evolution.
- Passage 2 examines the trend of gradual and consistent brain size increase over the past three million years in multiple hominin species.
Thought:
- Passage 1 and 2 approach the topic of brain evolution differently.
- Passage 1 centers on the role of specific genes in human brain development and evolution, while Passage 2 focuses on the gradual increase in brain size over time.
- Therefore, the main difference between the passages is the focus on different aspects of brain evolution.
- Choice D best describes this key difference between the passages.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Passage 1 discusses the discovery of NOTCH2NL, a gene that may have played a role in increasing human brain size, and genetic comparisons between humans and other primate species.
- Passage 2 discusses the gradual increase in average brain size among various hominin species over the past three million years, driven primarily by evolution within individual species but also by the addition of larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-brained ones.
Thought:
- Passage 1 and Passage 2 appear to differ in their focus and scope.
- Passage 1 centers on genetic factors related to brain evolution, whereas Passage 2 deals with brain size increases generally and traces their emergence over a longer time period.
- Passage 1 discusses ONLY humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans, while Passage 2 refers to different hominin species with varying brain sizes.
- Therefore, the correct answer is likely either B or C.
Criticism:
- Choice B is incorrect because passage 1 discusses genetic analyses of several primate species, not just human ancestors.
- Choice C is not completely accurate as Passage 1 focuses specifically on changes in recent evolutionary history, but mentions that NOTCH2NL has undergone copy-pasting over the last three million years.
- However, in general, Passage 1 does appear to have a narrower focus than Passage 2.
- Thus, the most accurate answer would be C with a caveat about the presence of the three-million-year time period in the passage.

Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses recent genetic data about the NOTCH2NL genes and their potential role in human brain development.
  Passage 2 discusses the relationship between brain size and evolution in various hominin species based on fossil evidence.
Thought:
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 are discussing two different things - genetic changes in brain development in Passage 1 and evolution of brain size over time in Passage 2.
  Therefore, the key difference between the passages is not related to whether the data is derived from fossils or computer simulations, or whether it is specific to human ancestors or multiple primate species.
  The key difference is that Passage 1 focuses on small-scale genetic changes that may have influenced brain evolution, while Passage 2 focuses on the influence of larger-scale population-level changes over time.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:

  B: Passage 1 discusses genetic analysis and brain size of several primate species including humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. Passage 2 focuses on our ancestor's brain size.
  C: Passage 1 discusses genetic changes over millions of years with respect to human brain evolution, while Passage 2 discusses the gradually increasing trend of brain size among hominins over the past 3 million years.
  D: Passage 1 focuses on the discovery and implications of individual genes like NOTCH2NL, whereas Passage 2 discusses population-level changes in brain size over time.
Thought: 
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 cover different aspects of evolution of human brain size.
  Passage 1 pertains to a gene in the human genome while Passage 2 presents an analysis of multiple fossils.
  Thus, the key difference between the two passages is the way they approach the evolution of human brain size: Passage 1 focuses on genetics, while Passage 2 focuses on the analysis of fossils.
  Therefore, option B is irrelevant and can be eliminated, option A is incorrect, and options C and D cannot be completely excluded.
  However, option D does not give a precise context to our ancestor's evolution.
Criticism: 
  Option C is technically correct but incomplete, because Passage 2 focuses on human evolution that led to our current brain size, which spans over a longer time period.
  Option D is partially correct but not precise because the passage 2 also focuses on the role of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-brained ones in the evolution of brain size.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society
Question: It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when
Choices:
  A: masses of people are well versed in political history.
  B: political parties become committed to reform.
  C: fewer political parties are competing for people’s votes.
  D: vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Parsons initially believed that government could be used to alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed.
  However, he came to believe that governments use their power to silence voices of dissent and promote the interests of the few (scheming few) over the many.
  He realized that political parties, once in power, are human with human attributes (such as the desire to remain in power).
  It does not make a difference what a political party promises when out of power, once in control, it will do anything to remain in power.
  Parsons concluded that it is not safe to entrust society's affairs, with their manifold ramifications, in the hands of finite man. 
  Parsons preferred anarchism, which opposes any form of authority in society.

Thought: 
  Parsons argues that positive social change will take place only when governments are no longer in power (since they will always wield their power in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many). 
  Individuals need to become more vocal and proactive in addressing their concerns and protesting against government policies.
  According to Parsons, moving towards anarchism (opposing any form of authority in society) will allow for the fullest development of individual units in society. This full development of individual units in society is necessary for positive social change.

Criticism: 
  The statement that "positive social change will take place only when governments are no longer in power" is an extreme viewpoint that is not shared by all. 
  Anarchism is just one perspective on how to achieve positive social change, and there are many other viewpoints. 
  The text does not explicitly state that Parsons thinks "positive social change will take place only when individuals become more vocal and proactive in addressing their concerns and protesting against government policies." However, this is the viewpoint implied by the text. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Parsons was interested in the Labor Question.
  Parsons was initially of the belief that government could alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed.
  He later concluded that governments used their power to silence the voice of discontent and supported the interests of a few at the expense of the many.
  Governments followed progress and never led it.
  Political parties were hungry for power and built powerful machines to crush opposition and silence voices of discontent.
  Parsons rejected political socialism in favor of anarchism, which promoted individualism and opposed government restrictions.
Thought:
  Parsons believed that governments would not lead positive social change, and they would only follow it when forced to do so.
  Such change could only take place when the voice of the protesting minority could no longer be ignored, and progress moved one step forward.
  Parsons believed that political parties were only interested in remaining in power and building a powerful machine to crush all opposition.
  Therefore, positive social change is less likely to happen when political parties are competing for power and controlling all the details that go into people's lives.
  Instead, Parsons believed that positive social change is more likely to happen when individuals, with their diverse views and aspirations, are free to interpret their lives and situations without governmental interference.
  Thus, Anarchism was better suited to bringing about positive social change than political socialism or parties.
  Therefore, D: vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns seems to be the most reasonable answer.
Criticism:
  The passage doesn't specifically say that vocal individuals will compel governments to address their concerns. The text suggests that progress moves forward when the voice of the protesting minority can no longer be ignored. It doesn't indicate how that happens or imply the role of vocal individuals.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Parsons believes that government power is always wielded in the interest of the few.
  Governments never lead; they follow progress.
Thought: 
  Parsons holds the view that the concentrated power of the government can be always wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many. Government rarely leads or champions progress and change, but only slowly follows it after vocal opposition. He also asserts the idea that giving control of society's affairs to any political party--regardless of their promises while out of power--would not be the safest or best policy. Therefore, change can only happen when vocal opposition and minorities force governments to address their concerns.
  The answer is D: vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that Parsons believes masses of people must be well-versed in political history for positive social change to take place.
  Similarly, there is no evidence in the passage to suggest that Parsons believes political parties must become committed to reform for positive social change to take place.
  The passage does not speak about the number of political parties competing in elections.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Parsons learned during his experience with the Labor Question that the government could not be an instrument for oppressed people, and history has shown how concentrated power tends to be wielded by the few at the expense of the many. Governments never lead, but follow progress. Concentrated power can always be used by the few at the expense of the many. Power corrupts, and men will abuse it when they possess it.
  A: While Parsons emphasizes the importance of historical knowledge, he does not suggest it is a requirement for social change.
  B: Parsons is skeptical of political parties and believes their leadership will always put the retention of their power over their promises to the people they represent.
  C: There is no evidence in the text regarding fewer political parties.
  D: Parsons suggests that social change will only occur when the protesting minority's voices can no longer be silenced by the prison, stake, or scaffold and the majority is compelled to acknowledge and respond to their legitimate concerns. 
Thought:
  Parsons believes the concentrated power of government can always be wielded against the many and should not be trusted.
  Governments are never at the vanguard of social change: they drag their feet until confronted with compelling opposition.
  Therefore, social change will only take root when a minority is vocal and effective at expressing their grievances and aspirations, and when the majority is compelled to respond to them.
  The answer is D: vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.
Criticism: 
  None identified.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author believes that governments use their power to oppress the people and that concentrated power can be wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many. 
  Parsons came to believe that it would not be the safest nor best policy for society to entrust the management of all affairs to political parties and that men will abuse power when they possess it. 
Thought: 
  Parsons believes that positive social change will only take place when people turn from a sincere, earnest political party to non-political movements like anarchism that can provide the proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society which can never be the case under government restrictions. 
  Therefore, positive social change will take place when people are disenchanted with political parties and turn to anarchism. 
  Thus, the answer is not A, B or D and must be C "fewer political parties are competing for people’s votes" if any claiming the best answer.
Criticism: 
  There is no direct mention of fewer political parties leading to positive social change in the passage. 
  While Parsons does not advocate for political parties, he does not indicate that fewer political parties competing for people's votes is a necessary condition for positive social change. 
  Therefore, it cannot be reasonably inferred that C is the correct answer. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: Parsons was initially interested in the "Labor Question" during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. He thought that governments could be an instrument to alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed. However, a closer study of governments convinced him that concentrated power could be wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many. He concluded that it would not be the safest nor the best policy for society to entrust the management of all its affairs, including social and industrial affairs, to any political party. He turned from political socialism to anarchism because he believed that only in its philosophy could he find the proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society which can't be the case under government restrictions.
Thought: 
  Parsons is an anarchist.
  He believes that concentrated power can be wielded in the interest of few and at the expense of many.
  Parsons thinks that the management of all of society's affairs, social and industrial, should not be entrusted to any political party.
  Therefore, positive social change will only take place when vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.
  The answer is D: vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.
Criticism: 
  Your thoughts align with Parsons' ideas.
  Given that he does not place trust in any political party, it does not make sense to choose answer choice B.
  Answer choice A includes no mention of what Parsons believes, so it is not the correct answer.
  There is no indication that Parsons believes that there should be fewer political parties competing for people’s votes, so answer choice C is also incorrect.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Parsons became interested in the Labor Question during the great railroad strike of 1877.
  Parsons thought that government could be an instrument to alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed.
  Parsons later realized that governments could use their concentrated power to silence the voice of discontent and to retard progress.
  Parsons learned that political parties would make fair promises out of power, but would eventually have to build up a powerful machine to stay in power and silence any opposition.
  Parsons concluded that it would not be the safest nor best policy for society to entrust the management of all its affairs to political parties.
Thought:
  According to Parsons, governments never lead and only follow progress.
  Positive social change will take place only when vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns and progress moves on a step.
  It cannot be inferred from the passage that masses of people are well versed in political history. 
  It cannot be inferred from the passage that political parties become committed to reform.
  It cannot be inferred from the passage that fewer political parties are competing for people's votes.
  The statement "When the prison, stake, or scaffold can no longer silence the voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a step, but not until then" suggests that positive change can only happen when the oppressed speak up and demand change.
  Therefore, the answer is D: vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.

Knowledge:
  The author's name is Parsons.
  Parsons became interested in the Labor Question during the great railroad strike of 1877.
  Despite thinking that the government could alleviate the suffering of the oppressed, Parsons came to believe that governments can retard progress.
  Parsons learned that it makes no difference what fair promises a political party out of power might make to the people.
  Parsons believes it would not be the best policy for society as a whole to entrust the management of all its affairs in the hands of finite man to be managed by the majority party.
  Parsons turned from political socialism to anarchism because in its philosophy he believes he can find the proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society.
Thought:
  Parsons does not believe that the government or the majority party can alleviate the suffering of the oppressed; rather, he believes progress moves onward through the voice of the protesting minority.
  Parsons believes that men will abuse power once they possess it.
  Parsons turned from political socialism to anarchism because he believes it allows for the fullest development of the individual units in society, free from government restrictions.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.
  The answer is D: vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the passage that Parsons thinks masses of people are well versed in political history would lead to positive social change.
  While Parsons does believe that fewer political parties might be better, he does not suggest that it is the key to positive social change.
  Although Parsons recognizes that fair promises can inspire hope in people, he does not believe that political parties becoming committed to reform will lead to positive social change.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The author is discussing his experience with the labor movement and his thoughts on government power.
  He believes that concentrated governmental power can be wielded in favor of the few at the expense of the many.
  The author is critical of political parties and does not believe that entrusting all affairs to any political party is safe or effective.
Thought:
  Parsons does not believe that positive social change will occur as long as political parties have control of all of society's affairs.
  He believes that men will abuse power when they possess it and thinks that entrusting political parties with societal management will lead to the oppression of the minority.
  Parsons argues for a non-political form of socialism called anarchism where individuals can develop freely.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when there is no political authority restricting individual development and creativity.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  In the passage, Parsons indicates that he became interested in the Labor Question during the railroad strike of 1877 and initially believed that the government could be made an instrument to help the oppressed. However, he later changed his mind after studying the origin, history, and tendency of governments. He came to realize that concentrated power in governments can be wielded by a few in the interest of the few and against the many. Governments never lead; they follow progress, and only when the prison, stake, or scaffold can no longer silence the voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a step. Parsons does not believe that any political party, once in power, will make good on its fair promises to the people, and he fears that any political party in power will use its authority to restrict the freedom of individuals, which will hinder positive social change. In Parsons' philosophy, true progress will come only when all human beings have the proper conditions for their fullest development, which can never be the case under government restrictions. Parsons therefore turned from a political socialist to the non-political phase of socialism—Anarchism.

  Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred from the passage that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.
  The answer is D: vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.
Criticism: 
  You are correct. Parsons believes that concentrated power in governments can be wielded by a few in the interest of the few and against the many.
  For Parsons, positive social change can happen only when individuals are willing to speak out against the government and its policies. 
  He believes that concentrated power is antithetical to individual liberation.
  So, the answer is indeed D: vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these "low-threshold" nerves "C-tactile," or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their "exquisite sensitivity" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations
Question: It can reasonably be inferred that one of the intended goals of the 1999 experiment was to determine the
Choices:
  A: precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.
  B: relationship between body hair and CT fiber function.
  C: role played by CT fibers in the perception of pain.
  D: effect of microneurography on CT fiber signaling.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses a series of experiments that investigate the properties and functions of C-Tactile (CT) fibers in human hairy skin, particularly in their response to gentle tactile stimuli. The 1999 experiment carried out on patient G.L. aimed to determine whether or not CT fibers could convey a pleasant sensation, the location and type of sensory information that CT fibers can distinguish, and the brain regions activated by CT fiber signaling.
Thought: 
  The article mentions that the 1999 experiment intended to address whether CT fibers could convey a pleasant sensation and what aspect of sensation they relay. It also aimed to determine the brain regions activated by CT fiber signaling. Therefore, A: precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey is a reasonable inference from the description of the experiment in the article.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the discovery of slow-conducting nerves, known as CT fibers, that respond to gentle pressure and convey a pleasurable sensation. 
  In 1999, the researchers sought to understand more about the characteristics of these CT fibers. 
Thought: 
  The article states that in 1999, the researchers wanted to know if a single, slow nerve could distinguish between different stimuli and convey a pleasant sensation. 
  This implies that one of the goals of the experiment was to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey. 
  Therefore, the answer is A: precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The 1999 experiment aimed to test whether slow nerve fibers could distinguish the location and type of tactile stimulus, and whether they provide a pleasant sensation.
  A: The experiment focused on determining the sensory information conveyed by slow nerve fibers, including CT fibers.
  B: The experiment did not investigate any relationship between body hair and CT fiber function.
  C: The experiment did not investigate the role of CT fibers in the perception of pain.
  D: Microneurography was a technique used in the experiment, but the experiment did not aim to test its effect on CT fiber signaling.
Thought:
  The passage describes that the 1999 experiment sought to determine whether slow nerve fibers like CT fibers could distinguish the location and type of tactile stimulus, and whether they provide a pleasant sensation.
  None of the options relate to the main goals of the experiment other than A.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the intended goal of the 1999 experiment was to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.
  The answer is A.
Criticism:
  There is no explicit statement in the passage that confirms this inference.
  However, the passage does describe that the nature of sensory information conveyed by CT fibers was not well understood at the time, and the experiment sought to investigate this nature more closely.
  Moreover, the results of the experiment suggest that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  In the 1999 experiment, the researchers sought to explore what sensations CT fibers can convey and specifically whether they could convey a pleasant sensation.
  A: Option A accurately reflects the goal of the 1999 experiment mentioned in the passage and is consistent with the author's discussion of the experiment.
  B: While the experiment used hairy skin in its testing, there is no evidence to suggest that the researchers were specifically investigating the relationship between body hair and CT fiber function in this experiment.
  C: Although pain is mentioned as a type of stimuli that fast-signaling nerves respond to, the experiment is not focused on the role of CT fibers in the perception of pain.
  D: The passage does not suggest that microneurography had any effect on CT fiber signaling; it was simply the method used to measure the nerve impulses associated with gentle touch.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses a 1999 experiment carried out by the same researchers who previously identified CT fibers. The passage states that the experiment aimed to determine whether CT fibers could convey a pleasant sensation and other aspects of touch perception. Therefore, option A is likely to be the correct answer.

Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  In the early 1990s, textbooks believed that slow nerves only respond to pain and temperature, and that pressure and vibration are detected by fast nerves.
  Olausson, Vallbo, and Wessberg performed an experiment in 1993 investigating whether slow nerves can detect gentle pressure in humans.
  They discovered that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delayed signal was characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers which they named C-tactile (CT) fibers.
  CT fibers were discovered to be found only in hairy human skin and respond to slow, gentle tactile stimulation.
  In 1999, Olausson’s group investigated the characteristics of CT fibers more closely.
  G.L., a patient with an unusual nerve defect, was recruited to test CT fibers’ ability to detect a pleasant sensation.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the 1999 experiment to test CT fibers’ ability to detect pleasant sensations.
  G.L., a patient with an unusual nerve defect, was recruited to test whether CT fibers can distinguish between different types of gentle touches, such as with a brush.
  Overall, the experiment seems to be intended to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.
  Therefore, the answer is A: precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")

  A: Option A matches the goal of the 1999 experiment as stated in the passage.
  B: The researchers already knew that CT fibers were only present in hairy human skin, so this was not an intended goal of the 1999 experiment.
  C: The passage states that CT fibers do not respond to pain.
  D: The experiment used microneurography as a technique, but the goal was not to determine the effect of microneurography on CT fiber signaling.
Thought: 
  The passage describes that the researchers wanted to determine whether the same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the arm, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. They also wanted to know if that same fiber can convey a pleasant sensation.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the goal of the 1999 experiment was to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.
  The correct answer is A.
Criticism:
  There is no direct statement in the passage that confirms the intended goal of the 1999 experiment. However, the details in the passage suggest that determining the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey was the most likely goal of the experiment.

Topic: English
Context: A pair of recent studies suggests that although.industrialized nations may have benefitted from larger.cities, the same is not true for the rapidly urbanizing areas of.the developing world. In these parts of the globe, there really.might be such a thing as too much urbanization, too.quickly..The studies, by Susanne A. Frick and Andrés Rodríguez-.Pose of the London School of Economics, take a close look.at the actual connection between city size and nationwide.economic performance. Their initial study, from last year,.examines the relationship between economic development,.as measured by GDP per capita, and average metropolitan-.area size in 114 countries across the world between 1960.and 2010. To ensure robustness, it controls for variables.including national population size, physical land area,.education levels, economic openness, and other factors..The size of cities or metro areas across the world has.exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the.developing world growing much faster and much larger.than those in more developed nations. Between 1960 and 2010, the median city in high-income countries grew.modestly from 500,000 to 650,000 people; but the median.city in the developing world nearly quadrupled, expanding.from 220,000 to 845,000 people. In 1960, 12 of the top 20.countries with the largest average city size were high-.income countries; by 2010, 14 of the top 20 were in the.developing world..Urbanization has historically been thought of as a.necessary feature of economic development and growth, but.this study finds the connection is not so simple. While.advanced nations benefit from having larger cities,.developing nations do not. Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every.additional 100,000 in average population among its large.cities over a five-year period. But for developing nations, the.addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year.period..In their latest study, the researchers found that.developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck.from smaller and medium-size cities. These countries see.the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion.of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people.or less. Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic.impact in larger countries. Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic.benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million.or more, according to the study. This makes sense:.Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play.host to knowledge-based industries that require urban.agglomeration economies..There are several reasons why megacities^1 often fail to.spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world..For one, the lion’s share of places that are urbanizing.most rapidly today are in the poorest and least-.developed parts of the world, whereas the places that.urbanized a century or so ago were in the richest and.most developed. This history has created a false.expectation that urbanization is always associated with.prosperity..Additionally, globalization has severed the historical.connection between cities, local agriculture, and local.industry that powered the more balanced urban.economic development of the past. In today’s globally.interconnected economy, the raw materials that flowed.from the surrounding countryside to the city can all be.inexpensively imported from other parts of the world..The result is that the connection between large cities and.growth has now become much more tenuous, producing.a troubling new pattern of “urbanization without.growth.”.The researchers used multiple variables to calculate a weighted average.city size for each country studied and reported the median of those.averages..(^1) Typically defined as cities with populations of over ten million people

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two studies by Frick and Rodríguez-Pose from the London School of Economics. 
  The studies examine the relationship between city size and economic performance, specifically in the developing world. 
  The first study looks at the connection between economic development and average metropolitan area size across 114 countries between 1960 and 2010, controlling for various factors. 
  The second study looks at the economic impact of different-sized cities on developing nations, finding that smaller and medium-sized cities tend to have more economic benefit. 
  The passage suggests that urbanization in the developing world may not always lead to economic growth, particularly in the case of megacities.
Thought: 
  The passage provides two studies that look at the relationship between city size and economic performance.
  The studies show that while larger cities tend to be associated with economic growth in advanced nations, this is not true in developing nations.
  Instead, smaller and medium-sized cities tend to provide more economic benefit. 
  The passage also suggests that the historical context of urbanization, as well as the changing dynamics of globalization, may contribute to the troubles of "urbanization without growth".
  Therefore, the main purpose of the passage is to describe the causes and consequences of a phenomenon.
  The answer is A: describe the causes and consequences of a phenomenon.
Criticism: 
  There are several points in the passage that suggest that the authors are proposing a new solution to the issue of "urbanization without growth."
  For example, they suggest that developing nations may benefit more from smaller and medium-sized cities rather than megacities.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.
Question: Both authors would most likely agree that the changes in gender roles that they describe would be
Choices:
  A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
  B: unlikely to provide benefits that outweigh their costs.
  C: inevitable given the economic advantages of gender equality.
  D: at odds with the principles of American democracy.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that social changes will raise women and make them more and more equal to men. 
  It cautions against trying to make men and women equal by making them identical, and argues instead that society should acknowledge the physical and moral differences between men and women and give each an opportunity to fulfill their tasks in the best possible manner.
  Passage 2 argues that inequality used to be the basis of society, but things are changing such that people are now getting closer to a just equality. 
  It argues that each person should be able to aspire to the largest and highest sphere possible, rather than having their talents arbitrarily limited by their gender or social class.
Thought: 
  Both authors seem to share a belief that greater gender equality can and should be achieved.
  They both argue that this does not mean making men and women identical, nor does it mean arbitrarily limiting the sphere of activity for each gender.
  Instead, they seem to advocate for allowing people to fulfill their potential irrespective of gender.
  They would likely agree that the benefits of having greater gender equality would outweigh the costs.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication that either author specifically believed that these changes are part of a "broad social shift", although this interpretation is plausible. 
  Additionally, while the authors seem to believe that gender equality is important, neither passage provides a definitive answer as to whether the costs of achieving this equality outweigh the benefits. 
  However, neither author suggests that achieving greater gender equality is at odds with democratic principles.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The authors are discussing the changes in gender roles in society.
  The first author believes that social changes that make people more equal in general will raise women and make them more equal to men. However, the author disagrees with those who want to make men and women exactly the same in all things.
  The second author believes that society is moving toward a just equality and that people should be free to choose their own sphere of activity based on their abilities. The author argues against imposing arbitrary limits based on sex or class.
Thought: 
  Both authors seem to believe that gender roles have been unequal in the past and that there is a movement toward greater equality. The authors both focus on individual abilities and freedoms, rather than trying to impose one-size-fits-all rules based on gender or class. Therefore, both authors would most likely agree that the changes in gender roles that they describe would be part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
  The answer is A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passages discuss the potential for gender equality in society.
  They describe social changes that could lead to greater gender equality.
  Passage 1 warns against attempting to make men and women completely alike and instead advocates for each gender fulfilling their respective tasks to the best of their ability.
  Passage 2 argues for complete liberty of choice for individuals to pursue the largest and highest sphere for their abilities, without predetermined gender limits.
Thought: 
  Both passages envision a shift toward greater gender equality in society.
  Both argue against arbitrary limits based on gender and advocate for individuals to pursue their fullest potential.
  Therefore, both authors would most likely agree that the changes in gender roles are part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
  The answer is A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The authors discuss the changes in gender roles that have occurred or will occur due to the shift towards greater equality in society.
  A: Choice A suggests that the authors would agree that the changes they describe are part of a broader sociological trend towards greater equality.
  B: Choice B suggests that the authors would not support the idea that the changes would be beneficial, but neither author suggests that the costs outweigh the benefits.
  C: Choice C not discussed by either author.
  D: Choice D is not supported by the passages.
Thought:
  Both passages suggest that changes in gender roles are part of a broader move towards equality in society.
  The authors argue that improvements in equality should not involve making men and women the same but rather should involve finding the best use of each individual's talents regardless of gender.
  Therefore, both authors would most likely agree that the changes in gender roles that they described would be part of a broader social shift towards greater equality.
  The answer is A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
Criticism: 
  The answer A is correct based on the authors' content, logic, and reasoning.
  There is no evidence in the passages for the other choices.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The two passages discuss gender equality and whether it should result in making men and women identical or distinct.
  Passage 1 argues that social changes that bring superiors and inferiors closer together will give women greater equality but that men and women have different characteristics and should have different employments to fulfill their respective tasks.
  Passage 2 argues that inequality used to be the basis of society, but that all relations are now tending towards equality, and that allowing everyone complete liberty of choice in occupation will result in the best faculties of all its inhabitants being used.
Thought: 
  Although there are some differences in how they describe gender roles, the authors agree that there is a broad social shift toward greater equality.
  Passage 1 argues that as society changes, women will become more equal to men, and that differences in physical and moral constitution mean they should have distinct employments. 
  Passage 2 argues that society has moved away from inequality and is moving toward equality, and that allowing everyone liberty of choice in occupation will result in the best being used.
  Neither author argues that gender equality is inevitable or driven by necessity or economics, nor do they argue that the costs outweigh benefits or that gender equality is against the principles of American democracy.
  Therefore, A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality is the most suitable answer. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Both passages discuss the changes in gender roles and gender equality.
  Passage 1 describes the changes that democracy brings about and argues that these changes are more about giving women a distinct employment and fulfilling respective tasks in the best possible manner.
  Passage 2 argues that all occupations should be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and that the proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to.
Thought: 
  Both passages argue that there should be greater gender equality.
  They emphasize that this change is part of the broader shift toward greater social equality.
  The authors argue that this shift will benefit society as a whole.
  They both believe that by allowing people to fulfill their unique talents, society as a whole will benefit.
  The benefits of gender equality outweigh the costs.
  Therefore, both authors would agree that the changes in gender roles are part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
  The answer is A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
Criticism: None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that as democracy reduces other inequalities, it will raise the status of women and make them more equal to men, but opposes the idea of completely mixing or homogenizing the roles and functions assigned to each gender.
  Passage 2 argues that complete liberty of choice in occupations, without favor or discouragement, will lead to a society where everyone's best faculties will be used, regardless of gender.
Thought:
  Both passages argue for a more equal distribution of rights in society, including changes to gender roles that would promote equality and opportunity for all without disregarding the natural differences between genders.
  Neither passage suggests that such a shift would be unlikely to provide benefits that outweigh their costs.
  While Passage 1 doesn't argue that the changes are inevitable, Passage 2 does suggest that inevitable social changes will bring about greater equality.
  Neither passage argues that such a shift in gender roles is at odds with the principles of American democracy.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
Criticism: 
  There are some minor discrepancies in the interpretation of the passages - Passage 1 emphasizes the importance of maintaining distinct roles for men and women, while Passage 2 argues for the liberty of choice in all occupations.
  However, both passages agree that some level of social change to promote greater equality of opportunities is needed in society.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The two authors are writing about the changing gender roles in society and how they relate to equality.
  A: Author from both passages think that equality is important as a guiding principle of society. The first author supports the idea that democracy can result in greater equality in society, while the second author argues for "a just equality" in all human relations and the need for complete liberty of choice to determine an individual's proper sphere in society.
  B: Neither author specifically states that the costs of changing gender roles are too great, although the first author does caution against trying to make men and women completely the same.
  C: Only the first author discusses the economic advantages of gender equality, but indicates that making men and women too similar in work and other areas could "degrade" both sexes.
  D: Only the second author discusses how a just equality can be achieved in society and how every occupation should be open to all.
Thought: 
  Both authors discuss the importance of improving gender equality.
  Author 1 suggests that democracy can bring about greater equality in society, while at the same time cautioning against trying to make men and women completely the same.
  Author 2 argues for a just equality in all human relations and believes that allowing complete liberty of choice is the best way to ensure that people can choose the largest and highest sphere for themselves.
  Both authors do not seem to be suggesting that changes in gender roles would have costs that would outweigh the benefits of striving for greater equality.
  Option A seems to best capture the main idea from both passages.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The passages describe differing views on gender equality.
- Passage 1 discusses social changes that will bring women closer to the same level as men, but cautions against forcing men and women to be "alike."
- Passage 2 argues for complete liberty of choice in occupational roles regardless of sex or class.
Thought:
- Both passages discuss the importance of gender equality and explicitly state that women should have the same opportunities as men.
- Passage 1 notes that the democratic principle of equality will raise women up to be more equal to men.
- Passage 2 argues that applying the principles of equality to gender relations will help produce a just society.
- Therefore, both authors would most likely agree that changes in gender roles toward greater equality would be part of a broader social shift toward greater equality.
- Answer: A
Criticism:
- The authors' focus is mainly on the importance of gender equality and the ideal society that could result if men and women were equal. There is no basis to say whether or not the benefits of gender equality would outweigh the costs.
- Neither author explicitly states that gender equality is inevitable since society has a choice to accept it or not.
- Neither author suggests that changes in gender roles would be at odds with the principles of American democracy.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 presents arguments on how democracy supports equality between men and women in the long run if tasks are divided according to their interests and capabilities. 
  Passage 2 presents arguments on why inequality must be removed and why men and women should have equal opportunities to pursue their interests.
Thought: 
  Both authors argue that the traditional rule of gender inequality is decayed and society is moving towards a more equal society where occupations are divided between men and women according to their capabilities and interests. They also argue that true economic and social progress can only occur in a society that grants equal opportunities to all individuals without distinction of gender or race. 
  Therefore, both Passage 1 and Passage 2 would most likely agree that the changes in gender roles they describe would be part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
  The answer is A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: Based on the passage, the researchers’ conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that
Choices:
  A: no genetic variations were common to all those finches that were not also common to all the finches that did not use that technique.
  B: those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
  C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
  D: there is probably not a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of that technique and its prior transmission to those finches.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The study investigated the acquisition of tool use behavior in woodpecker finches.
  The researchers split broods into two groups, one with a tool-using model and one with a non-tool-using model.
  The researchers found that young woodpecker finches who had no exposure to tool use developed the ability to use tools via a genetic predisposition.
  The developmental process is strongly dependent on genetically fixed components despite the fact that individual learning plays a role.
Thought:
  The woodpecker finches that used the levering technique were displaying individual learning.
  To support the conclusion that they were displaying individual learning, the author must provide a reason why the observed behavior cannot be attributed to genetic factors.
  The passage explains that the behavior developed from a genetic predisposition but that individual learning enhanced the efficiency of the behavior.
  It does not state that there were no genetic variations common to all of the finches that used the levering technique.
  It also does not state that the finches stopped using the technique after the researchers altered the crevices.
  The fact that the levering technique involves a behavior that takes place inside a crevice and is difficult to observe and acquire socially is not relevant to the question of whether the finches were displaying individual learning.
  The passage discusses why a selection for a development process based on genetically fixed components could be advantageous in woodpecker finches rather than socially transmitted learning due to reliance on tool use for survival during the dry season.
  The absence of a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of that technique and its prior transmission to those finches isn't relevant either.
  Therefore, none of the options provide a reason why the observed behavior cannot be attributed to genetic factors.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The researchers conducted an experiment on woodpecker finches to investigate whether tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired socially.
The researchers split whole broods into two groups, with half of the chicks reared with a tool-using model and the other half reared with a non-tool-using model.
The researchers found that young woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to watch tool use develop this ability with similar aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were given the chance to observe tool use in adult woodpecker finches.
The developmental process seems to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components but is enhanced through individual learning.
The researchers demonstrated that non-social, individual learning can play an important role during the development of tool use in woodpecker finches.

Thought:
The researchers found that woodpecker finches used a novel levering technique to obtain prey and that this technique deviated from typical tool-using behavior performed by birds in the wild.
The researchers concluded that this deviation from typical tool use and its successful use by the woodpecker finches supports the idea that non-social, individual learning enhances the efficiency of tool use in woodpecker finches.
Therefore, the answer choice that supports the researchers' conclusion regarding individual learning is the one that explains how individual learning is involved in the development of the levering technique used by woodpecker finches.

Evaluation:
(A) talks about genetic variations and does not explain how individual learning is involved in the development of the levering technique.
(B) talks about the researchers altering the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the levering technique and not how individual learning is involved in its development.
(C) explains how the use of the levering technique takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially, but it does not directly explain how individual learning is involved in the development of the technique.
(D) talks about naturally occurring circumstances and does not explain how individual learning is involved in the development of the levering technique.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
The researchers conducted an experiment where they split whole broods of woodpecker finches from the Galapagos Islands into two groups and reared them with either a tool-using model or a non-tool-using model. They found that woodpecker finches can develop tool-oriented behavior without exposure to a tool-using model but instead rely on genetically fixed components. Although individual learning plays an important role in enhancing such behavior. Some of the birds developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild. The team concluded that genetic predetermination of tool use in woodpecker finches is stronger than in chimpanzees.
Thought: 
The researchers found that some of the woodpecker finches in the study developed a new levering technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior. They used this technique after observing the artificial crevices. The researchers found that the individuals showed individual learning when developing this new technique, which was not observed in the wild. 
Option A is incorrect since the passage does not state anything about genetic variations of the finches that used the levering technique. Option B is false because the researchers did not alter the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique, but instead the technique deviated from typical tool-using behavior. Option D may also be incorrect since the passage does not provide evidence about the development of the technique in naturally occurring circumstances. 
Option C is correct because the passage provides evidence that the portion of the levering technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice, making it difficult for other finches to observe and acquire such behavior socially. Therefore, the researchers' conclusion that individual learning played an important role in developing this new technique is supported. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The researchers conducted an experiment with woodpecker finches to investigate if the use of tools was acquired socially. 
  They found that young woodpecker finches could develop tool use with similar aptitude, even if they had never had the opportunity to watch a tool-using model.
  The developmental process of tool use in woodpecker finches appears to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components.
  During the experiment, some woodpecker finches developed a new tool-using technique that deviated from typical behavior, likely due to individual learning.
Thought: 
  The researchers found that woodpecker finches could acquire tool use without social learning.
  They observed that some birds developed a new, more efficient tool-using technique.
  The development of this technique appears to be due to individual learning as it deviates from typical behavior and was not transmitted through social learning, considering the solitary nature of this species.
  Therefore, the correct answer should explain why the new technique was developed through individual learning.
  Choice A and D are irrelevant and do not mention the development of the new tool-using technique.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about how the researchers altered the crevices to reduce the technique's effectiveness, but it doesn't imply anything about individual learning.
  The correct answer is C because it explains that the portion of the technique that deviates from typical behavior takes place inside a crevice, which makes it difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
Criticism: 
  The answer could potentially be explained by choice B if we assume that the woodpecker finches stopped using the technique after the researchers altered the crevices because they acquired the technique through individual learning, and not socially.
  However, this is not entirely clear from the passage, and it is more explicitly stated that the portion of the technique that is different from typical behavior is difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  - The researchers found that individual learning played an important role during the ontogeny of tool use in woodpecker finches.
  - The researchers observed five woodpecker finches in the study that used a novel levering technique to obtain prey.
  - The effectiveness of the novel levering technique depended on the specific artificial crevices used in the study.
Thoughts:
  - The question asks about what supports the researchers' conclusion about the individual learning of the woodpecker finches that used the novel levering technique.
  - Choice A talks about genetic variations, which is not relevant to the question and is not discussed in the passage.
  - Choice B talks about the woodpecker finches stopping the use of the technique after researchers altered the crevices, but this is not relevant to the conclusion about individual learning.
  - Choice D talks about naturally occurring circumstances, which is not related to the conclusion about individual learning.
  - Choice C, on the other hand, talks about the finches using the novel levering technique inside crevices, which makes it difficult for other finches to observe and acquire it socially; this supports the idea that the technique was not transmitted socially but rather developed individually.
Evaluation:
  - Choices A, B, and D are irrelevant to the question or to the researchers' conclusion about individual learning.
  - Choice C is the only choice that talks about the social transmission of the novel levering technique and how the way it is performed may have made it difficult for other finches to acquire it socially, which supports the researchers' conclusion about individual learning.
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The study investigated whether tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired socially and found that young woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to watch tool use develop this ability with similar aptitude as their siblings that were given the chance to observe tool use. 
  The developmental process is strongly dependent on genetically fixed components and although genetic predisposition plays a very specific role, non-social individual learning plays an important role during the ontogeny of tool use.
  The researchers discovered that five birds developed novel tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild because of the artificial crevices used in the study.
Thought: 
  The researchers discovered that some of the woodpecker finches developed a novel tool-using technique that deviates from the typical tool use performed by birds in the wild, mostly likely because of the differences between the artificial crevices used in the study and natural crevices and tree holes. 
  The researchers suggested that the fact that the woodpecker finches developed a novel technique that is not typically observed in the wild is evidence for non-social, individual learning.
  Therefore, non-social individual learning played an important role in the development of the novel levering technique.
  Choice A is not relevant to the discussion of the finches' development of the novel tool-using behavior.
  Choice B does not support the conclusion of individual learning. If anything, it suggests that the development of the technique can be influenced by changes in the environment.
  Choice C is a plausible explanation for why the novel behavior was not acquired socially, but it does not provide evidence for individual learning.
  Choice D is also not relevant to the discussion of the finches' development of the novel levering technique.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The researchers found that woodpecker finches have a genetic predisposition towards tool use, but individual learning can improve their efficiency in using tools.
  The researchers observed that some woodpecker finches developed a novel levering technique that deviated from typical tool use.
Thought: 
  The researchers found that woodpecker finches have a genetically predetermined developmental process for tool use, but individual learning can enhance the behavior's effectiveness.
  They observed that some woodpecker finches developed a novel levering technique for obtaining prey from artificial crevices and increased their use of this method after initial success.
  This observation indicates that individual learning can improve the efficiency of the woodpecker finches' tool use.
  Therefore, (A) and (D) are irrelevant to the researchers' conclusion.
  Although (B) provides some insight into how the researchers altered the crevices, it doesn't provide any support that those finches stopped using the technique.
  (C) is a plausible explanation as to why the finches' novel technique wasn't acquired socially.
  Therefore, the answer is C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The researchers conducted an experiment on woodpecker finches to investigate whether the use of a tool is acquired socially or genetically. 
  They found that a genetic predisposition plays a strong role in the developmental process, but individual learning also plays an important role in improving tool-using techniques. 
  Five individuals developed a new levering technique that deviated from typical tool-using behavior, and they significantly increased their use of this method after initial success. 
  A: This answer choice is about genetic variations, which is not related to individual learning of the levering technique.
  B: The passage does not provide information on whether the finches stopped using the levering technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices.
  C: This answer choice is correct. The portion of the levering technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice, which makes it difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially. This supports the researchers' conclusion that individual learning plays an important role in improving tool-using techniques.
  D: This answer choice is not directly related to the individual learning of the levering technique. 
Thought: 
  The question is asking which fact supports the researchers' conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning. 
  The passage provides information that individuals can improve tool-using techniques through individual learning. Five individuals developed a new levering technique that deviated from typical tool-using behavior. 
  Answer choice C describes the portion of the levering technique that is difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially, which supports the researchers' conclusion that individual learning plays a role in improving tool-using techniques.
  Therefore, answer choice C is the correct answer. 
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the fact that answer choice C supports the researchers' conclusion about individual learning of the levering technique. 
  However, the passage also provides additional information about the role of genetics and individual learning in the development of tool use in woodpecker finches. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The researchers conducted an experiment on woodpecker finches to investigate whether tool use is acquired socially or via genetic components. 
  They split each brood into two groups, one with a tool-using model and the other with a non-tool-using model. 
  Young woodpecker finches who never had the opportunity to watch tool use also developed tool use ability with similar aptitude, suggesting genetic components are more important.
  The researchers found that individual learning plays an important role during the development of tool use, and that woodpecker finches have a genetic predisposition for tool use. 
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the researchers’ conclusions about how tool use in woodpecker finches develops. 
  They found that the development of tool use is determined by a specific genetic component but is enhanced through individual learning. 
  The passage further explains that five individuals developed a technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior. 
  The researchers concluded that individual learning played an important role in the ontogenetic unfolding of this behavior.
  Therefore, the answer is likely an explanation of either why the finches developed this levering technique or how the five individuals learned this technique. 
  Choice B seems plausible since it suggests the birds stopped using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices. 
Criticism: 
  Choice A is not relevant to the explanation of individual learning of the levering technique. 
  Choice C is not entirely accurate since the behavior is enhanced through individual learning, not solely genetically predetermined.
  Choice D is not relevant to the explanation of individual learning of the levering technique.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
- The researchers conducted an experiment to investigate whether young woodpecker finches acquire twig tool use development via social learning.
- They took whole broods from the Galapagos Islands and split them into two groups, one with a tool-using model and the other with a non-tool-using model.
- They found that young woodpecker finches without the opportunity to observe tool use developed the ability with a similar aptitude and reached developmental steps similar to those given the chance to observe tool use.
- The developmental process seems to be largely dependent on genetically fixed components, but non-social individual learning plays an important role in improving efficiency.
Thought:
- The researchers found that five birds developed a technique that deviated from typical tool-using behavior.
- They also found that these birds improved their use of this method through individual learning.
- Therefore, the researchers concluded that non-social, individual learning does play an important role during the ontogeny of tool use, serving to improve the efficiency of this behavior.
- The question asks for evidence to support the conclusion that the researchers reached about individual learning being an important part of the development of tool-using behavior.
- The fact that the woodpecker finches developed a new technique that deviated from typical tool-using behavior, and improved upon it through individual learning, provides evidence to support the conclusion that non-social, individual learning is an important part of the development of tool-using behavior.
- Option A does not provide any evidence supporting individual learning and genetic variation.
- Option B talks about the behavior declining after a change in circumstances that does not provide any evidence supporting individual learning.
- Option D talks about the possible naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of that technique and its prior transmission to those finches, which is unrelated to the evidence of individual learning.
- Option C mentions that the technique takes place inside a crevice and is difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially, but it doesn't provide evidence supporting individual learning.
- Therefore, the answer is C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The news is a form of public knowledge..Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the.health of one’s friends and family; the conduct of a.Line private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge.increases in value as it is shared by more people. The.date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;.the causes and consequences of an environmental.disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular.law; the latest reports from a war zone—these are all.examples of public knowledge that people are.generally expected to know in order to be considered.informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or.private knowledge, which is generally left to.individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is.promoted even to those who might not think it.matters to them. In short, the circulation of public.knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded.as a public good which cannot be solely.demand-driven..The production, circulation, and reception.of public knowledge is a complex process. It is.generally accepted that public knowledge should.be authoritative, but there is not always.common agreement about what the public needs to.know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and.how authoritative reputations should be determined.and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The.Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely.regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative.agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied.the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of.authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the.opinions of others.” As part of the general process of.the transformation of authority whereby there has.been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional.sources of public knowledge, the demand has been.for all authority to make explicit the frames of value.which determine their decisions. Centres of news.production, as our focus groups show, have not been.exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps.some news journalists feel uneasy about this.renegotiation of their authority:.Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the.“most read” lists on their own and other websites.to work out which stories matter to readers and.viewers. And now the audience—which used to.know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of.journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our.credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008)..The result of democratising access to TV news.could be political disengagement by the majority.and a dumbing down through a popularity.contest of stories (online news editor, 2007)..Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,.they amount to more than straightforward.professional defensiveness. In their reference to an.audience “which used to know its place” and.conflation between democratisation and “dumbing.down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular.mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by.experts, immune from populist pressures; and.disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive.recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down.opportunities for popular involvement in the making.of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional.claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are.right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every.institutional level in contemporary society,.scepticism towards the epistemological authority of.expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed.by several of our focus group participants, that the.news media should be “informative rather than.authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to.“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their.slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient.information” from which “we would be able to form.opinions of our own.”.At stake here are two distinct conceptions of.authority. The journalists we have quoted are.resistant to the democratisation of news:.the supremacy of the clickstream (according to.which editors raise or lower the profile of stories.according to the number of readers clicking on them.online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”.news; the demands of some audience members for.raw news rather than constructed narratives.

  However, the answer choices do not mention people's desire for more information and facts to form opinions.
  Instead, they focus on what people want journalists to avoid.
  Therefore, a more accurate rephrasing of the question could be: "What do the authors suggest the public is coming to believe about what journalists' reports should avoid?"
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the production and circulation of public knowledge, including news. It notes that there is a tension between the desire for authoritative information and a growing skepticism of expert elites. The passage also suggests that there is a push for news to be more informative and less authoritative.
Thought: The passage notes that there is a growing feeling that news should be "informative rather than authoritative" and that people should be given "sufficient information" from which "we would be able to form opinions of our own." This suggests that the public is coming to believe that journalists' reports should avoid personal judgments about events reported, as they want information on which they can base their own opinions. Therefore, the answer is A: personal judgments about the events reported.
Criticism: There is no mention in the passage of the public wanting journalists to avoid more information than is necessary, quotations from authorities on the subject matter, or details that the subjects of news reports wish to keep private.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.
Question: In Passage 2, Mill most strongly suggests that gender roles are resistant to change because they
Choices:
  A: have long served as the basis for the formal organization of society.
  B: are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
  C: can be influenced by legislative reforms only indirectly.
  D: benefit the groups and institutions currently in power.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses how changes towards a more equal society must include gender roles.
  A: The passage does not explicitly suggest that gender roles have served as the basis for the formal organization of society.
  B: The passage suggests that gender roles are resistant to change because they are closely related to emotions, but it does not use the phrase "deeply entrenched tradition".
  C: The passage does not discuss the effects of legislative reforms on gender roles.
  D: Mill argues that forcing individuals to conform to limited gender roles is not only unjust to the individual and detrimental to society, but it also limits the potential of society as a whole.
Thought:
  The passage argues that gender roles are resistant to change because of how intimately they are associated with human emotions.
  Strong emotions are strongly linked to established traditions, and it is difficult for people to accept that their traditional lifestyle needs to change, especially if they feel that their identity is linked to their traditional role. 
  Therefore, gender roles are resistant to change because they are a deeply entrenched tradition.
  The answer is B: are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
Criticism:
  There is no direct statement in the passage saying that gender roles are linked to tradition.
  Instead, Mill focuses on the benefits of allowing people to follow their natural capacities, rather than imposing arbitrary restrictions based on gender or class.
  While the passage does suggest that gender roles are resistant to change, it may not be accurate to say that this is solely because of entrenched tradition.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses gender roles.
  A: The passage does not focus on the formal organization of society as the reason for resistance to change in gender roles.
  B: The passage suggests that gender roles are resistant to change for the main reason that deeply entrenched traditions are difficult to change.
  C: The passage does not suggest that reforms can only indirectly alter gender roles.
  D: The passage does not suggest that gender roles primarily benefit the groups and institutions currently in power.
Thought:
  The passage discusses how society shifted from being founded on inequality to a principle of equality.
  The relationship between men and women, being the nearest and most intimate relation, was the last to throw off the old rule and receive the new.
  The passage argues that of all the relations, gender roles are the most resistant to change due to how deeply entrenched traditions relating to the social and intimate relations of men and women are.
  The passage suggests that arbitrary limits declaring certain abilities were not allowed to be exerted by individuals of certain sexes or classes obstructed the development and progress of society by hiding its true potential.
  The passage does not refer to legislative reform when discussing the resistance of gender roles to change.
  Therefore, passage 2 most strongly suggests that gender roles are resistant to change because they are matters of deeply entrenched tradition. The answer is B: are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
Criticism:
  The answer choice A mentions the "formal organization of society". Passage 2 does mention associations grounded on equal rights scarcely existed in the past but does not focus on the formal organization of society as a reason for gender role resistance to change.
  The answer choice C mentions legislative reforms influencing gender roles directly or indirectly. While one could argue that legislative reforms are an example of society's shift towards equality as discussed in Passage 2, the passage does not focus on them as the primary reason for why gender roles are resistant to change.
  Answer choice D states that gender roles primarily benefit the groups and institutions currently in power. Although this is possible, the passage does not discuss this as the main reason for resistance to change in gender roles.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses the challenges of changing gender roles.
  A: While society was once organized around inequality, things have changed and equality is now seen as the general principle of human relations.
  B: A just equality is now preferred over the dominion of the strongest, but gender relations was the last to change.
  C: The proper sphere for all humans is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to.
  D: Interfering with an individual's capacities based on their sex is an injustice and a detriment to society.
Thought:
  Mill argues that changing gender roles is more challenging than changing other social relations because it is the closest and most intimate relation, and emotions associated with it tend to cling to old forms and circumstances.
  This statement suggests that gender roles are deeply entrenched and resistant to change.
  Therefore, Mill most strongly suggests that gender roles are resistant to change because they are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
  The answer is B: are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses the struggle to achieve equality between men and women in society.
  A: While society was once based on inequality, it has since shifted towards a more equal foundation.
  B: Gender roles are deeply entrenched in society and are difficult to change as they are connected to strong emotions.
  C: Legislative reforms may indirectly influence gender roles, but they are not the sole cause of change.
  D: Gender roles benefit those already in power, but this is not the primary reason for their resistance to change.
Thought: 
  According to Passage 2, gender roles are the last to change because of their connection to strong emotions and their deeply entrenched position in society.
  There is no indication that gender roles serve as the basis for formal organization in society.
  Legislative reform is mentioned as a potential factor in changing gender roles, but not in a significant way.
  While gender roles may benefit those already in power in society, the author does not suggest that this is the primary reason for their resistance to change.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct. 
  The passage's argument is about deeply entrenched gender roles and emotional attachment to those gender roles being real impediments to change. 
  There is no mention of gender roles serving as a formal basis for the organization of society, although it is implied that society was once hierarchical and unequal.
  The passage briefly discusses how societies need to make every occupation open to everyone without regard to sex or class.
  Choice C is close, but the passage suggests that legislative reform could be one of the efforts to change gender roles, not the sole effort.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses the resistance of gender roles to change.
  A: While society was based on inequality previously, the passage does not mention that gender roles were the basis for formal organization of society.
  B: Mill mentions that the struggle to change gender roles is due to its intimacy and the strength of emotions attached to it. This implies gender roles are embedded in tradition.
  C: The passage suggests that the old rule of inequality between sexes has been gradually substituted by the general principle of justice and equality.
  D: Passage 2 argues that the current system of gender roles is arbitrary and unjust, and imposes limits on individuals' abilities. Therefore, it doesn't benefit the groups and institutions currently in power.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that gender roles are deeply entrenched and resistant to change due to the strong emotions attached to them and the arbitrary limits imposed by society. 
  Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
Criticism: 
  There is no strong evidence in the passage to suggest that gender roles are resistant to change because they have served as a basis for the formal organization of society. 
  Rather, gender roles are described as being resistant to change due to their deeply entrenched nature and the strong emotions associated with them.

  C: The passage does not suggest that legislative reforms are the only way to influence gender roles.
  D: The passage does not suggest that gender roles necessarily benefit the groups and institutions currently in power.
Thought: 
  Mill argues that gender roles are the last to change because people have strong emotions tied to the forms with which they've become associated.
  The passage suggests that the key to social progress is to give each individual the liberty to choose their own sphere in life, regardless of gender.
  Therefore, Mill suggests that gender roles are resistant to change because they are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
  The answer is B: are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant flaw in the logic, facts, or reasoning of the previous answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses Mill's ideas on gender roles and equality.
  A: While society in the past has been based on inequality, this does not explain why gender roles are resistant to change.
  B: Mill suggests that gender roles are resistant to change because they are deeply entrenched tradition.
  C: Mill does not mention legislative reforms as being the primary factor in changing gender roles.
  D: While it can be inferred that some groups and institutions may resist change to gender roles, this is not the primary reason why gender roles are resistant to change.
Thought: 
  Mill argues that all relations should be founded on the principle of a just equality.
  He suggests that the relationship between men and women is the last to throw off the old rule and receive this principle.
  He notes that gender roles are associated with strong emotions and are therefore resistant to change.
  Moreover, gender roles are traditional and therefore hold significant sway over people's expectations.
  Mill suggests that it is difficult to change this situation but that it is worth striving for.
  Therefore, the answer is B: are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.
Criticism: 
  Gender roles being the basis for the formal organization of society could be seen as a more significant factor in their resistance to change.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  - Passage 2 discusses the historical inequality between men and women and how society is changing towards equality.
  - The passage argues for complete liberty of choice in occupation, without arbitrary gender or class restrictions.
Thought:
  - The passage acknowledges that gender roles are deeply rooted and intimate, and so change is difficult.
  - The passage argues that slowly, society has been substituting justice for strength/dominance as the guiding principle in relationships, and that this must be applied to gender relations as well.
  - Therefore, Mill most strongly suggests that gender roles are resistant to change because they are "matters of deeply entrenched tradition".
  - Answer: B
Criticism:
  - None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the resistance to changing gender roles.
  A: The organization of society is mentioned in the passage, but not as the basis for resistance to changing gender roles.
  B: The passage strongly suggests that gender roles are resistant to change because they are deeply entrenched in tradition and connected with strong emotions.
  C: Legislative reforms are not mentioned as the only way to influence gender roles, and the passage suggests that societal change is necessary.
  D: The passage does not suggest that gender roles benefit groups or institutions in power.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the resistance to changing gender roles, particularly in the intimate relationship between men and women.
  Since men and women have the strongest and most intimate relationship, the process of changing gender roles is difficult and will take a long time.
  Strong emotions are connected to the current gender roles, which makes them difficult to change, since people tend to cling on to what they have even if it doesn't serve them well.
  The passage emphasizes that opening up the sphere of occupations to all without favor or discouragement will allow individuals to prove their capacities and benefit society as a whole.
  The passage clearly suggests that the difficulty of changing gender roles is due to deeply entrenched traditions and strong emotions associated with these roles.
  Therefore, B: are matters of deeply entrenched tradition is the correct answer.
Criticism:
  There could be an indirect link between traditional gender roles and the groups in power (e.g., men), but the passage doesn't explicitly mention this connection, so D is not completely wrong.
  However, the passage emphasizes tradition and emotions as the main reasons for the resistance to changing gender roles, so B is the stronger answer.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,.but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the.doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The.poor market may be slowing innovation, but.advances continue; judging by the mood this week at.the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in.Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain.optimistic about its long-term prospects..The technology that’s surprised almost everyone.is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and.Martin Green, professor at the University of.New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar.panel researchers, declared that they’d never go.below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per.watt,” he says..The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of.reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar.panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020..Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target.even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the.direct cost of solar power to six cents per.kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost.expected for power from new natural gas power.plants..All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have.been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the.power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady.cost reductions. Green points to something as.mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of.the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar.cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon.solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To.achieve that record, he had to use expensive.lithography techniques to make fine wires for.collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual.improvements have made it possible to use screen.printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research.suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce.lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of.the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at.costs far lower than his lithography techniques..Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable.Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a.new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,.which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar.cell they made is the only current challenger to.silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film.cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower.the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power.cheaper..One of Green’s former students and colleagues,.Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer.China Sunergy, announced this week that he is.building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided.solar cell that can absorb light from both the front.and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that.during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the.land between rows of solar panels in a solar power.plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels.and could be harvested to increase the power output..This works particularly well when the solar panels.are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a.one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a.two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He.expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more.electricity over the course of a year..Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,.aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in.cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to.greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels.by combining silicon with one or two other.semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a.part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert.efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost.efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to.around 40 percent. Adding another could make.efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which.would cut in half the number of solar panels needed.for a given installation. The challenge is to produce.good connections between these semiconductors,.something made challenging by the arrangement of.silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden  with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are 5 the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the10 procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those15 doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty20 years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that25 makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively30 no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us35 then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old40 family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so 45 long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The0 questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that55 procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will60 object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men65 have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our70 brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the75 gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this "civilization" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in80 them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?
Question: According to the passage, Woolf chooses the setting of the bridge because it
Choices:
  A: is conducive to a mood of fanciful reflection.
  B: provides a good view of the procession of the sons of educated men.
  C: is within sight of historic episodes to which she alludes.
  D: is symbolic of the legacy of past and present sons of educated men.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the bridge over the River Thames as being a vantage ground for surveying.
  The bridge provides a view of the River Thames, the city of London, and the Houses of Parliament.
  Woolf describes the procession of the sons of educated men as an important subject.
Thought:
  Woolf chooses the setting of the bridge because it is a good place to view the procession of the sons of educated men.
  The view of the procession is a key part of the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is B: provides a good view of the procession of the sons of educated men.
Criticism:
  While it is true that the bridge provides a view of the procession of the sons of educated men, this is only a small part of why Woolf chose the setting of the bridge.
  Woolf also describes how the bridge provides a view of the River Thames, the city of London, the Houses of Parliament, and historic episodes.
  Additionally, she describes how the bridge is a place for serious reflection, rather than fanciful reflection.
  Therefore, the answer is not A or B.
  The bridge is not described as being symbolic of the legacy of past and present sons of educated men, so the answer is not D.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The author describes the bridge as a vantage point for viewing the River Thames, the city, and Westminster.
  The author comments on the solemnity of the procession of educated men; it is a sight she has seen before and also participates in now.
Thought:
  Woolf describes the setting of the bridge as a place for reflection, but she immediately contrasts this with the need to focus on the procession.
  While the view of the city may be inspiring, she highlights the importance of considering the procession and the questions it raises.
  The bridge itself does not seem to be symbolically important, but rather serves as a practical location from which to view and consider the procession.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: provides a good view of the procession of the sons of educated men.
Criticism:
  The bridge's location certainly offers a view of the city and Westminster, as the author describes, but this is not the main reason the author chooses to set the scene there.
  While the bridge may have some symbolic importance in terms of crossing over barriers and transitions- going from one side of the river to the other - none of this is addressed in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author chooses the setting of the bridge in order to make a survey of the procession of the sons of educated men.
  A: The passage does mention that the bridge is "a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming" but this is not the main reason why Woolf chooses the setting.
  B: The bridge does provide a good view of the procession of the sons of educated men, but this is not the reason it was chosen as the setting.
  C: The passage does mention that on one side of the river are the domes and spires of the city and on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament, but this is not the main reason why Woolf chooses the setting.
  D: The passage does not mention that the setting of the bridge is symbolic of the legacy of past and present sons of educated men. 
Thought: 
  Woolf chooses the setting of the bridge because it provides a good view of the procession of the sons of educated men.
  Therefore, the answer is B: provides a good view of the procession of the sons of educated men.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct that the bridge provides a good view of the procession of the sons of educated men.
  However, the main reason Woolf chooses the setting of the bridge is not because it provides a good view of the procession of the sons of educated men. 
  The passage states that the bridge is "an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey," suggesting that the setting was chosen because of its ability to facilitate reflection and contemplation.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is A: is conducive to a mood of fanciful reflection.
Action: Answer("A")

- The passage describes a setting of a bridge over the River Thames.
- The narrator mentions the river and the views on either side of the bridge.
- The narrator observes a procession of educated men.
Thought:
- Woolf chose the setting of the bridge at the River Thames because it provides a view of the procession of the sons of educated men.
- The narrator mentions the views from the bridge, but only in passing.
- While Woolf does use imagery of the procession crossing a desert, the bridge itself is not presented as symbolic of the legacy of past and present sons of educated men.
- There is nothing in the passage to suggest that Woolf chose the setting for fanciful reflection. 
- Therefore, the correct answer is B: provides a good view of the procession of the sons of educated men.
Criticism:
- It is possible that Woolf chose the bridge setting for multiple reasons.
- However, the main focus of the passage is on the procession of the sons of educated men and the questions it raises.
- While the bridge provides a picturesque backdrop for the procession, the main reason for choosing this setting is its association with this procession.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the setting of a bridge over the River Thames.
  The bridge is described as an "admirable vantage ground" to survey the river and the surrounding buildings.
  The bridge is also used as a location to consider the procession of educated men.
Thought:
  Woolf chose the setting of the bridge because it provides a good view of the procession of educated men.
  The passage mentions that the bridge is a good location to survey the river and the surrounding buildings.
  However, these aspects of the setting do not seem to be directly related to the topic of the procession of educated men.
  On the other hand, the passage focuses specifically on the procession of educated men, and how the perspective on this procession changes for those who join it themselves.
  So, the most likely reason for Woolf to choose the setting of the bridge is to emphasize the importance of the procession of educated men.
  Therefore, the answer is B: provides a good view of the procession of the sons of educated men.
Criticism:
  There is some support for the idea that the bridge is conducive to a mood of reflection, as the passage describes it as a place to "stand upon by the hour, dreaming." 
  However, the main focus of the passage is on the procession of educated men, and the bridge is primarily used as a location to observe them.
  While the bridge is within sight of historic buildings, the passage does not suggest that this is the reason for Woolf to choose the setting.
  The description of the bridge as a symbol of the legacy of educated men is not directly supported by the passage, which focuses more on the present and future of the procession of educated men.
Action: Answer("B")

  The bridge offers a view of the River Thames, the city on one side, and Westminster and the Houses of Parliament on the other.
  The view from the bridge serves as a place to stand and dream.
Thought: 
  The bridge provides a view of the procession of the sons of educated men that Woolf discusses.
  However, the primary reason why Woolf chooses the setting of the bridge is that it offers a place to survey the surroundings and dream.
  It provides a scenic setting for spectators to view the procession of the sons of educated men.
  Therefore, the answer is A: is conducive to a mood of fanciful reflection.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the bridge offers a view of the procession of the sons of educated men.
  However, the passage makes it clear that the bridge provides a vantage ground to survey the surroundings and dream.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L. Cox-Foster et al., "A Metagenomic Survey of Microbes in Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder." @2007 by American Association for the Advancement of Science.The table above shows, for colonies with colony collapse disorder and for colonies without colony collapse disorder, the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together
Question: Do the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections?
Choices:
  A: Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder.
  B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  C: No, because the data do not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder.
  D: No, because the data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, which feeds on bee hemolymph and can kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria, or viruses.
  The passage also discusses the possible nutritional deficiency of commercial bee colonies, which may leave them susceptible to mite infestations.
  The table shows the percent of colonies affected by various pathogens with and without colony collapse disorder.
Thought:
  The question asks if the data in the table support the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
  The table does not provide direct evidence of mite infection. However, the passage describes the effect of mite infestations on bees as increasing their susceptibility to secondary infections.
  Looking at the table, we can see that for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  Therefore, it is likely that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections, which supports the authors' claim.
  Using answer elimination: 
   - C is incorrect because the data do not exclude bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder.
   - D is incorrect because the passage explicitly mentions the effect of mite infestations on honeybees.
   - A is incorrect because not all the colonies suffering from colony collapse disorder show evidence of an infection with a pathogen from the table.
  Therefore, Answer("B") is the correct answer.
Criticism:
  None
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Varroa destructor mite and its effect on honeybees.
  The Varroa mite feeds on bee hemolymph and can kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria, or viruses.
  The table provides data on the occurrence of pathogens in honeybee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
Thought: 
  The Varroa mite can increase the susceptibility of honeybees to secondary infections, including viruses and fungi.
  If the data in the table show that honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder have a higher occurrence of viruses and fungi than colonies without the disorder, then it would support the authors' claim.
  Looking at the table, the percent of colonies affected by viruses (83% for CCD, 5% for non-CCD) and fungi (100% for CCD, 81% for non-CCD) are both higher for CCD colonies. Therefore, the data supports the authors' claim.
  The answer is B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Criticism: 
  None of the answer choices mention Varroa mites specifically, even though the passage states that Varroa mites are a factor in honeybee susceptibility to secondary infections.
  Additionally, the answer could be misleading because only two types of pathogens are being compared in the table (viruses and fungi), and the table does not indicate whether the honeybees were infected with mites.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that honey bees are hosts to Varroa destructor, which can kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria, or viruses. 
  The table shows the percent of colonies affected by various pathogens in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
Thought: 
  The authors claim that infection with Varroa mites increases the susceptibility of honey bees to secondary infections.
  The table shows that for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  Therefore, the data in the table support the authors' claim.
  The answer is B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Criticism: 
  It is possible that other factors, not just Varroa mites, cause colony collapse disorder and increase the susceptibility of honey bees to other infections.
  The table does not provide evidence that a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder.
  The answer is the best choice among the given options, but it is not entirely conclusive.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how Varroa destructor mites, in addition to killing bees directly, can increase bees' susceptibility to secondary infection by fungi, bacteria, or viruses.
  The table shows the occurrence of several pathogens, including viruses and fungi, in honey bee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
Thought:
  The table does not explicitly mention Varroa destructor mites, nor does it measure mite infestation.
  However, the authors' claim is not about the direct effects of Varroa destructor mites, but rather their role in increasing susceptibility to secondary infection.
  The data in the table do show a clear difference in the occurrence of several pathogens between colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
  This suggests that something is making the affected colonies more susceptible to infection, which could be Varroa destructor mites or some other factor.
  Therefore, the data do support the authors' claim that Varroa destructor mites increase a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
  Answer("B")
Criticism:
  Choice B is a reasonable answer, as it correctly notes that the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen is higher for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without.
  However, it does not explicitly connect this data to Varroa destructor mites or susceptibility to secondary infections.
  Nonetheless, the pattern of higher pathogen occurrence in colonies with colony collapse disorder does suggest that something is weakening those colonies' immune systems, which could plausibly be Varroa destructor mites.
  Thus, while choice B is not a perfect expression of the authors' claim, it is still the best answer among the choices provided.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage states that Varroa mites can increase the susceptibility of bees to secondary infections.
  The table shows the percent of colonies affected by different pathogens and whether or not they have colony collapse disorder.
  A: The table only indicates the presence of pathogens, not necessarily that they caused the disorder.
  B: This statement is true, but it doesn't necessarily relate to the claim about Varroa mites.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the question at hand.
  D: The passage asserts that honeybees are hosts to Varroa mites.
Thought:
  The question asks whether the data support the claim that Varroa mites increase susceptibility to secondary infections.
  The table shows that colonies with colony collapse disorder have a higher percentage of infection for all pathogens listed.
  The passage asserts that Varroa mites increase susceptibility to secondary infections.
  Therefore, the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim.
  The answer is B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Criticism: 
  Your logic is sound and the conclusion is reasonable.
  The data do show a correlation between colony collapse disorder and higher rates of pathogen infection which may be due to the Varroa mites increasing susceptibility.
  B is the best answer choice, as it provides a more direct connection between the data in the table and the authors' claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the negative effects of varroa mites on honey bees, stating that they can kill bees directly or make them more susceptible to secondary infections.
  The table shows the percent of honey bee colonies affected by various pathogens with and without colony collapse disorder (CCD).
Thought:
  The question is asking whether the data in the table provides support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
  The passage suggests that varroa mites can make bees more susceptible to secondary infections, but we need to see if the data in the table support this claim.
  Option A is incorrect because it only refers to pathogen-caused colony collapse disorder, not secondary infections.
  Option B is more promising because it looks at the data for each pathogen and whether it is more prevalent in colonies with CCD. However, it's not clear whether all of these pathogens are secondary infections caused by varroa mites.
  Option C is irrelevant as bacteria are only mentioned as one of several possible causes of secondary infections.
  Option D is incorrect because the passage clearly states that honey bees can be infected by varroa mites.
  Overall, option B is the best answer, as it suggests that there is a relationship between secondary infections and CCD, although it's not clear if the individual pathogens are related to the infection with varroa mites. 
Criticism: 
  It's possible that the pathogens listed in the table are not caused by varroa mites, even though they are related to CCD. There may be other causes of CCD that are unrelated to mite infestation. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how Varroa mites can kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibility to secondary infections with fungi, bacteria, or viruses.
  The table shows the percent of colonies with and without colony collapse disorder that are infected with various pathogens.
Thought:
  The question is whether the data in the table support the authors' claim that Varroa mites increase a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
  We don't necessarily need to find evidence that Varroa mites directly cause colony collapse disorder.
  Choice A says that the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder. However, this is not necessarily true. While infection with a pathogen is associated with colony collapse disorder, we can't conclude that it caused it.
  Choice B says that, for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder. This is true according to the table, but it doesn't directly address the role of Varroa mites.
  Choice C is a distraction because the authors don't claim that bacteria are a cause of colony collapse disorder.
  Choice D is incorrect because the passage clearly states that Varroa mites increase a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage mentions that Varroa mites can increase a bee's susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses.
  The table shows the percent of colonies with honey bee infections categorized by those with and without colony collapse disorder for various pathogens.
Thought:
  The presence of Varroa mites can make honey bees more susceptible to secondary infections, but the table provides no information about whether the honey bees in the colonies were infected with Varroa mites.
  The data show that for certain pathogens, a higher percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder showed infections compared to colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  Therefore, based on the given information, the data in the table do not provide clear support either in favor or against the authors' claim.
  Choices C and D are incorrect because they are not a complete evaluation of the data presented in the table.
  Choice A is incorrect because not all colonies with pathogens underwent colony collapse disorder.
  Choice B seems plausible because the percentage of bee colonies infected with a pathogen is greater for colonies with the disorder than those without. 
Criticism: 
  The data could be more persuasive if it indicated the presence of Varroa mites in colonies and whether there was a correlation to the presence of other pathogens.
  While a higher percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder have infections, without knowing the exact cause of colony collapse disorder, we cannot be certain if a secondary infection due to Varroa mites was a factor.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that Varroa destructor mites can increase honeybees' susceptibility to secondary infections.
  The table shows the percent of honeybee colonies affected by various pathogens with and without colony collapse disorder.
  A: The table does show that certain pathogens are more prevalent in colonies with colony collapse disorder compared to those without.
  B: The table does show that for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for those with colony collapse disorder compared to those without.
  C: The passage mentions bacteria as a possible cause of secondary infection, but the question is specifically about Varroa mites.
  D: The passage explicitly mentions Varroa destructor mites.
Thought:
  Varroa destructor mites can increase honeybees' susceptibility to secondary infections.
  The table shows the percent of honeybee colonies affected by various pathogens with and without colony collapse disorder.
  The percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder affected by each pathogen is greater than those without.
  Therefore, the data in the table support the authors' claim that infection with Varroa mites increases honeybees' susceptibility to secondary infections.
  The best answer is B.
Criticism:
  There is no alternative explanation for why the percent of colonies affected by each pathogen is greater in those with colony collapse disorder than in those without. 
  Therefore, the conclusion that Varroa mite infestation increases susceptibility to secondary infection is well-supported by the data in the table.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the impact of varroa mites on honeybees and their susceptibility to secondary infections.
- The table shows the percent of honeybee colonies affected by various pathogens in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder (CCD).

Thought:
- The question is asking if the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
- The passage states that varroa mites can increase the bees' susceptibility to secondary infection, but this claim is not directly tested in the table.
- However, the table does provide information about the prevalence of various pathogens in colonies with and without CCD, which could indirectly support the claim if varroa mite infestation is known to increase the incidence of these pathogens.
- Looking at the data, for each pathogen listed, the percentage of colonies with CCD that are affected is higher than the percentage of colonies without CCD that are affected.
- This suggests that CCD is associated with increased prevalence of various pathogens, but it does not prove that varroa mites directly increase susceptibility to these pathogens.

Criticism:
- The data in the table show correlation, but do not prove causation.
- The passage notes that varroa mites can increase susceptibility to secondary infections, but does not clearly establish that this is the cause of the higher percentages of colonies affected by various pathogens in CCD vs non-CCD colonies.
- There could be other factors contributing to the higher incidence of secondary infections in CCD colonies - for example, CCD itself could weaken the bees' immune systems and make them more susceptible to all types of infection.
- The table does not directly address varroa mite infestation, so any conclusions drawn from it about the impact of mites on secondary infections would be speculative.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.
Question: Which choice best summarizes the passage?
Choices:
  A: A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job.
  B: A woman does not correct a stranger who mistakes her for someone else.
  C: A woman impersonates someone else to seek revenge on an acquaintance.
  D: A woman takes an immediate dislike to her new employer.
Response 0:
Answer("A") A woman is stranded after missing a train and is mistaken for a governess by an upper-class woman who employs her for the job. The woman accepts the new job and is given instructions to teach history and French in a way that will interest the children.
Response 1:
Answer("A") : The passage is about a woman, Lady Carlotta, who misses her train and is taken for a governess position out of happenstance. Her employer, Mrs. Quabarl, explains the responsibilities of the job, and Lady Carlotta responds in a cold manner. The passage mainly focuses on Lady Carlotta's thoughts and reactions to her new working environment.
Response 2:
A woman accepts a job as governess to Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola for Mrs. Quabarl. Lady Carlotta sees a horse in distress and intervenes. She misses her train and is mistaken for Miss Hope, the new governess. Mrs. Quabarl seems overbearing and knocked off her perch when Lady Carlotta does not adhere to expectations. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
The passage describes a woman who misses her train and is mistaken for a governess by a wealthy woman named Mrs. Quabarl. Though the protagonist initially agrees to impersonate the governess, she later proves to be a difficult employee. Mrs. Quabarl becomes flustered by this unpredictability. Therefore, choice A: "A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job" is not an accurate summary of the passage. Choice B: "A woman does not correct a stranger who mistakes her for someone else" is a true statement, but it does not capture the essence of the passage. Choice C: "A woman impersonates someone else to seek revenge on an acquaintance" is not at all what happens. Therefore, the best summary of the passage is D: "A woman takes an immediate dislike to her new employer." 
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes a woman named Lady Carlotta and her encounter with a horse struggling with a load and the carter pulling the load.
  Lady Carlotta has a history of intervening on behalf of distressed animals but was warned that she should not do so.
  She once followed this advice but later regrets it and has resumed intervening.
  Lady Carlotta lost her train but wasn't upset because her friends and family are used to her arriving without luggage.
  Lady Carlotta is mistaken for someone else by Mrs. Quabarl.
  Lady Carlotta is recruited to work as a governess for Mrs. Quabarl's four children.
  Mrs. Quabarl gives Lady Carlotta specific expectations for teaching her children.
  Lady Carlotta contradicts Mrs. Quabarl's expectations.
  Mrs. Quabarl is embarrassed by Lady Carlotta's contradiction, causing her to become apologetic.
Thought: 
  The passage describes Lady Carlotta's experiences at a small station, where she intervenes in a struggle between a horse and its carter. She loses her train but is indifferent to the loss. Lady Carlotta is mistaken for a new governess, Miss Hope, and is shown the ropes by Mrs. Quabarl. Mrs. Quabarl has high expectations for the governess but is put in her place by Lady Carlotta.
  None of the choices captures the full essence of the passage.
Criticism: 
  The four choices offered are inaccurate. None of them describe what actually occurs in the passage.
  Choice A suggests that Lady Carlotta is weighing the pros and cons of accepting a new job, but there is no evidence in the passage that she is doing this or that she is even looking for a job.
  Choice B is also incorrect. Lady Carlotta does correct Mrs. Quabarl about her identity, but only to a limited extent. Lady Carlotta does not impersonate someone else to seek revenge on anyone.
  Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication that Lady Carlotta seeks revenge on an acquaintance.
  Choice D is incorrect because Lady Carlotta does not immediately dislike Mrs. Quabarl. In fact, Lady Carlotta doesn't know initially who Mrs. Quabarl is and only later discovers that she has been mistaken for someone else and is offered a job as a governess.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passages tells a story of a Lady Carlotta who steps out of a train while it's waiting and sees a horse struggling with a load that it's carrying. She goes to help the horse which causes her to miss her train. As a result, a woman mistakes her for a governess she has come to meet and the Lady's philosophical indifference leads her to go along with the mistake, pretending to be the governess. During the car ride, the new employer gives detailed instructions about how she wants the children to be taught. Lady Carlotta subtly antagonizes her new employer by not fawning over her possessions or instructions.  
Thought:  
  The passage describes a series of events that occur when a Lady Carlotta goes to help a struggling horse and misses her train. She's then mistaken for a governess by a woman who has come to meet her and she goes along with it. During the car ride, the new employer gives detailed instructions about how she wants the children to be taught. Lady Carlotta subtly antagonizes her new employer by not fawning over her possessions or instructions.
  The best summary of these events is A: A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job.
Criticism: 
  While it is true that Lady Carlotta ends up taking on a new job as a governess, the passage is not really about whether she weighs the positive and negative aspects of the job offer. Rather, the story is more about the series of events that lead her to the job, such as missing the train and being mistaken for the governess, and the interactions she has with her new employer. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes Lady Carlotta, a woman who interferes on behalf of a distressed animal, misses her train, and then pretends to be a governess that Mrs. Quabarl had hired to teach her four children.
Thought: 
  The passage follows Lady Carlotta, a woman who intervenes on behalf of a struggling horse, misses her train, and then assumes the identity of a governess who was supposed to teach the children of her new employer. Throughout the text, Lady Carlotta seems indifferent and casually flippant towards those around her while disregarding their opinions and sometimess even offending them (e.g. losing the friendship of an acquaintance who preached non-interference; pretending she was somebody else during the drive with Mrs. Quabarl). 
  Therefore, the best option is A: A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job.
Criticism: 
  While Lady Carlotta does impersonate a governess, the passage does not suggest that she does it for revenge. Instead, the text suggests that she does it on a whim and out of a desire to amuse herself.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage centers around a woman named Lady Carlotta and her encounter with a horse and a carter, as well as her interaction with Mrs. Quabarl. 
Thought:
  Lady Carlotta helps a distressed horse and loses her train. 
  Lady Carlotta impersonates a governess named Miss Hope and is taken to Mrs. Quabarl's house. 
  Mrs. Quabarl gives Lady Carlotta instructions on how to teach her children.
  Lady Carlotta sarcastically responds to Mrs. Quabarl's inquiries, which embarrasses Mrs. Quabarl.
  Therefore, the correct choice is A, "A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job".
Criticism: 
  The summary states, "A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job". However, there is no indication in the passage that Lady Carlotta is in the process of considering a job offer or thinking about accepting a new job.
  The passage is about Lady Carlotta and her encounter with the horse, Mrs. Quabarl, and Mrs. Quabarl's children.
  The correct choice should encompass the main idea and events of the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Summary:
The passage describes how Lady Carlotta helps a horse struggling with a load on a roadway. Later, she misses her train and meets Mrs. Quabarl, who mistakes Lady Carlotta for a governess she was supposed to meet. Lady Carlotta impersonates the governess and goes to Mrs. Quabarl's house, where she learns about the children she is supposed to teach. Lady Carlotta demonstrates her mastery of French and Russian to Mrs. Quabarl, who is intimidated.  
Choice: A: A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job. (This option is incorrect as there is no mention of Lady Carlotta either considering or taking a new job. She only impersonates a governess.) 
Choice: B: A woman does not correct a stranger who mistakes her for someone else. (This option is partially correct, as Lady Carlotta does not correct Mrs.Quabarl but instead impersonates the governess. But the passage is not just about this one instance.) 
Choice: C: A woman impersonates someone else to seek revenge on an acquaintance. (This option is entirely incorrect. There is no mention of Lady Carlotta seeking revenge nor of an acquaintance. She impersonates someone else to get a job.) 
Choice: D: A woman takes an immediate dislike to her new employer. (This option is incorrect. Lady Carlotta's disdain for Mrs. Quabarl grows, but initially, there is no apparent dislike.) 
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Answer("A") A woman accepts a new job as a governess for a wealthy family after missing her train due to helping a horse in distress. She meets her new employer and is given instructions about teaching the children, which include making the subjects interesting. The woman's behavior throws the employer off-balance, making her doubt herself.

Topic: English
Context: Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie's eyes. Finally, she spoke.90 "I met him at my literary meeting."Naomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped."Mother.""Yes?"95 "I mean to have him."\begin{itemize}\item a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name\end{itemize}

  Therefore, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to introduce the situation. 
  The answer should be none of the above.
Criticism:

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.
Question: The author of Passage 2 would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 by asserting that such claims
Choices:
  A: only apply to certain subspecies of tigers and are therefore inconclusive.
  B: will offer incentive for countries and regions to invest further in wildlife preservation programs.
  C: prove that rigorous efforts to protect endangered species result in quick recovery of populations.
  D: may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses a new report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that suggests the number of wild tigers may be slowly rising across Asia due to successful conservation programs.
  Passage 2 discusses the flaws in the methodologies used to estimate tiger populations and that a reliance on outdated tools can be insidious in conservation practices.
Thought:
  The author of Passage 2 believes that counting tiger populations using flawed methodologies may lead to inaccurate conclusions about tiger populations.
  While the report by the WWF in Passage 1 suggests that tiger populations may be slowly rising due to successful conservation programs, the author of Passage 2 would likely argue that the methodology used in the report may be flawed and is therefore inconclusive.
  Furthermore, the author of Passage 2 emphasizes the importance of monitoring source tiger populations using rigorous scientific methods.
  Therefore, the author of Passage 2 would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 by asserting that such claims may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
  The answer is D: may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
Criticism:
  There are no flaws in the logic or reasoning used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 reports that tiger populations in the wild might have been slowly rising over the last several years, which could be due to the success of conservation programs in some countries.
  Passage 2 asserts that although the science of tiger population assessment has progressed rapidly, many governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies have not adopted the new methods. It also criticizes the methodology used to estimate tiger population figures in a recent report by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum.
Thought:
  The author of Passage 2 would criticize the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 because they were based on methodology that may not be reliable. 
  The author would advocate the idea that it is essential to monitor source populations and use the best science available to track tiger numbers.
  Therefore, the author of Passage 2 would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 by asserting that such claims may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
  The answer is D: may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
Criticism:
  Your analysis is correct based on the information provided in both passages.
  The author of Passage 2 is more concerned with advocating the use of reliable scientific methods rather than criticizing the subspecies of tigers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 reports that a World Wildlife Fund study has suggested that the number of tigers living in the wild is slowly rising, which may mark the first time in more than a century that tiger populations have grown. However, counting wild tigers is not an easy task and the report suggests that while several countries have seen an increase in tiger populations, others have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 argues that although the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has been slow. The passage discusses the flaws in methodologies used to determine tiger population numbers, citing flawed extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor. 
Thought: 
  Passage 1 makes claims about a slow rise in the number of tigers in the wild, which while positive, is difficult to verify given the difficulty of counting the animals. 
  Passage 2 criticizes outdated methodologies used to determine tiger population numbers and argues for the need for reliable scientific data in order to set realistic goals and measure the impact of conservation efforts. Therefore, the author would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 by asserting that such claims may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
  The answer is D: may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage talks about the estimation of the number of tigers in the wild and the methods used to estimate the population of tigers in the wild.
  Passage 1 talks about a new report from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that claims the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years.
  Passage 2 discusses the scientific methods used by conservation agencies to estimate the number of tigers in the wild and argues that old, flawed methodologies lead to inaccurate population estimates.
Thought: Both passages talk about methods used to estimate the number of tigers in the wild. While Passage 1 claims that the tiger population has been slowly rising over the last several years due to successful conservation programs, Passage 2 asserts that official estimates based on flawed methodologies produce inaccurate population numbers and that reliable counts are necessary to set realistic goals and measure the impact of conservation efforts. Therefore, the author of Passage 2 would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 by asserting that such claims may lead people to believe that tiger populations are recovering when they still require vigilant protection.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The first paragraph of Passage 1 discusses a report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) suggesting that the number of tigers living in the wild has been slowly rising over the last several years; however, counting wild tigers is difficult.
  The second paragraph of Passage 1 discusses the challenges of tracking tiger populations and the sobering reality that some countries have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 argues that estimates of tiger populations based on outdated tools can be misleading and undermine conservation efforts.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage 2 is critical of estimates of global tiger populations; such estimates may rely on flawed methodologies and mask losses in specific countries.
  The author's concern is that such estimates may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
  Therefore, the author would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 by asserting that such claims may be misleading and require further scrutiny to ensure that tiger populations are truly on the rise.
  The answer is D: may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses a new report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) suggesting that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years and that the commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. The passage also notes that counting wild tigers is difficult, as their habitats have become tiny and scattered and they are notorious for being elusive. Additionally, while global numbers may have gone up, a country-by-country analysis reveals that some countries have lost their tiger populations thanks to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 discusses the methods used to estimate tiger numbers and range in several countries across Asia. It notes that although the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has not, whether because of a lack of understanding or comfort with new methods or because old methods cast a more flattering light on their efforts. The passage argues that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be the top priority: guarding and growing the source populations. The author emphasizes the importance of using the best available science to track the numbers of source populations.
Thought:
  The author seems skeptical of the conclusions presented in Passage 1 that suggest that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years due to conservation efforts. 
  The author argues that although global numbers may have gone up, a country-by-country analysis indicates that some countries have lost their tiger populations thanks to poaching and habitat loss.

  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The author of Passage 1 reports a new study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) suggesting that the number of wild tigers might have increased.
  The study conducted by WWF proposes that some countries' commitment to and success of conservation programs have contributed to the global growth of tiger population.
  According to the author of Passage 2, the tiger population estimates made based on official estimates and methodologies may not be reliable as they may undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be our top priority which is guarding and growing the source populations using the best science available.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage 2 would most likely criticize the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1, as they suggest that tiger population is on the rise globally and this may lead people to believe that tigers no longer critically require vigilant protection, while the truth is that only with reliable counts of source populations can we develop suitable strategies to measure the impact of our conservation efforts.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
Criticism: 
  You are correct! The author of Passage 2 argues that the tiger population estimates made based on flawed methodologies such as statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor may not be reliable as they may undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be our top priority - guarding and growing the source populations using the best science available.
  Moreover, the author suggests that only with reliable counts of source populations can we develop suitable strategies to measure the impact of our conservation efforts.

  Passage 1 describes a study suggesting that the population of wild tigers may have been slowly rising over the last several years.
  The study found at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today, a considerable increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010.
  The commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population.
  Passage 2 argues that although the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has not.
  The author suggests that reliance on outdated tools undermines efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be the top priority: guarding and growing the source populations.
Thought: 
  Passages 1 and 2 seem to have differing opinions on the recent news that the tiger population may be slowly rising.
  While Passage 1 presents the study as a positive development and suggests that the commitment to and success of conservation programs have contributed to the growth, Passage 2 argues that such claims may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
  The author of Passage 2 focuses on the flaws in the current methods of assessing the tiger population, arguing that the goals for population growth set by organizations such as the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be unrealistic and that rigorous efforts to protect endangered wildlife are necessary for quick recovery of populations.
  From this perspective, the author would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1, asserting that such claims may offer false hope and should be met with continued vigilance and protection.
  The answer is D: may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage 1, a new World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report suggests that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years.

The study suggests that conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population.
  In Passage 2, the author criticizes the methodology behind the WWF's population estimates, which were based on flawed methodologies and statistically weak extrapolations.
Thought: 
  Passage 1 claims that wild tiger populations may have been slowly rising over the last several years, and that conservation programs have contributed to this trend.
  Passage 2 criticizes the methodology behind these population estimates and argues that more rigorous methods are needed to track tiger populations.
  Therefore, the author would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 by asserting that such claims may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when, in fact, more rigorous methods are needed to track their populations and they continue to require vigilant protection.
  The answer is D: may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
Criticism: 
  Nothing in Passage 1 or Passage 2 suggests that only certain subspecies of tigers are recovering, so option A is not correct.
  Although Passage 1 suggests that conservation programs may have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population, it does not make any claims about whether the study proves that rigorous efforts to protect endangered species result in quick recovery of populations, so option C is not correct.
  Finally, while it is possible that the claims in Passage 1 could offer incentive for countries and regions to invest further in wildlife preservation programs, this is not the author's main point, which is to criticize the methodology behind the WWF's population estimates. Therefore, option B is not correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 reports that a recent study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) suggests that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years.
  Passage 2 discusses the limitations of tiger population assessment methods and the need to monitor source populations using rigorous techniques.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,.but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the.doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The.poor market may be slowing innovation, but.advances continue; judging by the mood this week at.the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in.Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain.optimistic about its long-term prospects..The technology that’s surprised almost everyone.is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and.Martin Green, professor at the University of.New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar.panel researchers, declared that they’d never go.below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per.watt,” he says..The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of.reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar.panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020..Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target.even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the.direct cost of solar power to six cents per.kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost.expected for power from new natural gas power.plants..All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have.been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the.power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady.cost reductions. Green points to something as.mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of.the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar.cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon.solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To.achieve that record, he had to use expensive.lithography techniques to make fine wires for.collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual.improvements have made it possible to use screen.printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research.suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce.lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of.the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at.costs far lower than his lithography techniques..Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable.Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a.new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,.which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar.cell they made is the only current challenger to.silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film.cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower.the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power.cheaper..One of Green’s former students and colleagues,.Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer.China Sunergy, announced this week that he is.building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided.solar cell that can absorb light from both the front.and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that.during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the.land between rows of solar panels in a solar power.plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels.and could be harvested to increase the power output..This works particularly well when the solar panels.are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a.one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a.two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He.expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more.electricity over the course of a year..Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,.aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in.cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to.greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels.by combining silicon with one or two other.semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a.part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert.efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost.efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to.around 40 percent. Adding another could make.efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which.would cut in half the number of solar panels needed.for a given installation. The challenge is to produce.good connections between these semiconductors,.something made challenging by the arrangement of.silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.
Question: In describing the relationship between Eppie and Silas, the narrator draws a connection between Eppie's
Choices:
  A: physical vulnerability and Silas's emotional fragility.
  B: expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life.
  C: boundless energy and Silas's insatiable desire for wealth.
  D: physical growth and Silas's painful perception of his own mortality.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the relationship between Silas and Eppie.
  A: The passage does not mention anything about Eppie's physical vulnerability.
  B: The passage describes Eppie's expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life.
  C: The passage does not mention anything about Silas's desire for wealth.
  D: The passage describes Eppie's physical growth, but does not address Silas's perception of his own mortality.
Thought: 
  The passage details Eppie's influence on Silas and how she forces him to engage with life beyond his weaving. 
  Eppie's expanding awareness is seen as mirroring Silas's unfolding memory and full consciousness as he becomes more involved with her.
  This suggests that Eppie's growth and engagement in life parallels Silas's growth and rebirth from his former life of solitude and disconnection.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life.
Criticism: 
  The answer is appropriate based on the details provided in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The passage describes the relationship between Eppie and Silas as she grows and develops.

Thought: 
- The passage describes how Eppie's development and growing awareness also causes changes in Silas.
- Silas's "soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness."

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.
Question: The narrator indicates that Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola are
Choices:
  A: similar to many of their peers.
  B: unusually creative and intelligent.
  C: hostile to the idea of a governess.
  D: more educated than others of their age.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage is describing Lady Carlotta's encounter with Mrs. Quabarl and her four children.
  There is no specific information indicating whether Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola are similar to their peers (A), unusually creative and intelligent (B), hostile to the idea of a governess (C), or more educated than others of their age (D).
Thought:
  The passage does not provide any direct description of Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, or Viola's personalities or characteristics.
  Therefore, I cannot determine their similarities or differences from their peers (A), their intelligence or creativity (B), their feelings about governesses (C), or their educational level (D).
  The correct answer is 'None of the Above'.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Lady Carlotta is a woman who enjoys helping animals in distress and is not afraid to interfere on their behalf. 
  Lady Carlotta typically loses her luggage when she travels.
  Lady Carlotta has been mistaken for a governess named Miss Hope and has been taken by Mrs. Quabarl to be the governess for her children, Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola.
Thought: 
  The passage does not provide any information about whether the children are more creative or intelligent than their peers, or whether they are hostile to governesses. 
  Mrs. Quabarl expresses a desire for the children to be taught and interested in what they learn. 
  Therefore, the children are likely similar to many of their peers in their education.
  The answer is A: similar to many of their peers.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes Lady Carlotta's encounter with Mrs. Quabarl, who mistakes her for the new governess. 
  Mrs. Quabarl gives some information about her children, Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola, and her expectations for the governess.
Thought:
  The passage does not provide a lot of information about Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola's personalities.
  Mrs. Quabarl indicates that she wants the new governess to make learning interesting for her children.
  It is not clear whether the children are unusually creative or intelligent, hostile to the idea of a governess, or more educated than others of their age.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is A: similar to many of their peers.
Criticism:
  There is no information in the passage to support any of the choices.
  However, the passage provides some context for the class and type of children that Mrs. Quabarl's children are likely to be.
  For example, Mrs. Quabarl expects her children to learn French with the governess.
  This suggests that the children come from a class and type of people who can afford to hire a governess and who would value learning French.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The passage describes Lady Carlotta meeting Mrs. Quabarl, who mistakes Lady Carlotta for the new governess for her four children: Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola. Mrs. Quabarl has specific expectations for the governess in terms of teaching and language proficiency.
Thought: The passage does not mention the educational levels of Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola. However, it does state that Mrs. Quabarl expects the governess to help the children become interested in their subjects, and to teach them French. This suggests that the children are not necessarily highly educated or particularly interested in learning.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The passage describes Lady Carlotta, who takes on the role of a governess for Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola. The passage gives some indication of the children's personalities and interests as described by Mrs. Quabarl, their mother and Lady Carlotta's employer.
Thought: 
  Mrs. Quabarl describes her children as delicate and sensitive with high artistic temperament.
  Nothing in the passage indicates that they are more educated than others of their age.
  The children's description seems to suggest that they are unique compared to their peers.
  Therefore, the most accurate answer choice is B: unusually creative and intelligent.
Criticism: None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Lady Carlotta has been hired as a governess for four children.
  The children are named Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola.
  Mrs. Quabarl, the mother of the children, wants the governess to make the children interested in their lessons.
Thought:
  The passage does not give information indicating that the children are unusually creative or intelligent, or that they are hostile to the idea of a governess.
  Instead, the text describes Mrs. Quabarl's expectations regarding their education and interest in learning.
  Therefore, the children are likely similar to many of their peers.
  The answer is A: similar to many of their peers.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Lady Carlotta is a governess who has just met Mrs. Quabarl, likely her employer.
  Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola are individuals about whom Mrs. Quabarl is concerned.
  A: The narrator does not provide information to suggest that the children are similar to many of their peers.
  B: The narrator identifies Irene as having an artistic temperament, but not the others, and does not suggest they are unusually creative or intelligent.
  C: The narrator does not provide information to suggest the children are hostile to the idea of a governess.
  D: Mrs. Quabarl expresses a desire for her children to be both taught and interested in their lessons, but the narrator does not provide information to suggest they are more educated than others of their age.
Thought: 
  The narrator provides some information about the personalities of the children, but none of the choices seem to match what is given. 
  However, it is possible that the children could be similar to their peers, which is not explicitly stated but is likely.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: similar to many of their peers.
Criticism: 
  The idea that the children are similar to many of their peers is plausible, but it is not directly provided in the passage. 
  It could be argued that the children are actually more educated or intelligent than their peers, as Mrs. Quabarl seems to have high expectations for their governess.
  Still, it is the most likely answer based on the information given.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Lady Carlotta has been delayed at a small train station and witnesses a horse struggling with a heavy load.
  Lady Carlotta intervenes to help the horse, despite warnings from acquaintances not to interfere in the affairs of animals.

Thought: 
  Mrs. Quabarl has hired Lady Carlotta to be a governess to teach and care for her four children.
  Mrs. Quabarl expects Lady Carlotta to develop in her children a love of history and an interest in learning.
  Lady Carlotta does not appear impressed by the patronage of the Quabarls nor by their newly purchased expensive car.
  The narrator does not provide any evidence to suggest that the children are unusually creative or intelligent or that they are more educated than others of their age. 
  Therefore, the children are likely similar to many of their peers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Lady Carlotta is traveling by train to a destination to work as a governess.
  She meets Mrs. Quabarl who hires her as a governess for her children - Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola.
  Mrs. Quabarl emphasizes that she wants her children not only to be taught, but interested in what they learn.
Thought: 
  Nothing in the passage suggests that Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola are unusual for children of their class and type.
  Therefore, the answer is A: "similar to many of their peers."
Criticism:
  You are correct that nothing in the passage suggests that Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola are unusually creative and intelligent, more educated than others of their age, or hostile to the idea of a governess.
  However, the passage also does not give any indication that they are "similar to many of their peers."
  In fact, the passage doesn't provide much information about the children beyond a few brief descriptions of their temperament and personalities.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: The passage describes Lady Carlotta's encounter with a woman, Mrs. Quabarl, who mistakes her for a governess she was supposed to meet. Mrs. Quabarl tells Lady Carlotta about her four children, Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola, and what she expects from the governess she hired.
Thought:
  Mrs. Quabarl describes her children as "delicate, sensitive young people" and notes that Irene has the "artistic temperament highly developed." These descriptions do not necessarily mean they're more creative or intelligent than their peers, but it's a possibility.
  Mrs. Quabarl also expresses the desire for the children to be interested in what they learn, which suggests that she thinks her children are similar to their peers in lacking a natural enthusiasm for education.
  There is no indication that the children are hostile to the idea of a governess, and the passage provides no evidence that the children are more educated than others of their age.
  Based on the information provided, the most logical answer is A: similar to many of their peers.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to make a definitive judgement on what Claude, Wilfred, Irene, and Viola are like. While Mrs. Quabarl does describe her children as "delicate, sensitive young people" and notes that Irene has the "artistic temperament highly developed," the passage does not provide any concrete evidence to suggest a particular personality type or level of intelligence.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land  where they were born; and that they areproperty-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose ofall these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a 15 greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction.Any other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women's20 interest to change the assignment they have received.It seems to us incontestable that our common happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in25 the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the30 home? And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a35 manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life's companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand 40 that the good of all demands this of you.\section{Passage 2}Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of45 knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her50 reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an55 orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations....Consider, sir, dispassionately, these60 observations-for a glimpse of this truth seemed to open before you when you observed, "that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it65 was impossible to explain." If so, on what does your constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this70 country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman-prescription.Consider-I address you as a legislatorwhether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their75 own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift 80 of reason?In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination, from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be 85 useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark?

  B: They needed a good education to be successful in society.
  C: They were just as happy in life as men were.
  D: They generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that women should not be allowed to participate in politics, as their delicate constitutions and duties as mothers set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the home. 
  Passage 2 argues that women need education to become the companion of men and that if they are not prepared by education, they will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue.
Thought:
  Both passages talk about women in the eighteenth century.
  According to Passage 1, women shouldn't participate in politics and focus on their gentle occupations.
  According to Passage 2, women need education to become the companion of men and to progress knowledge and wisdom.
  Both passages argue that women were excluded from political participation.

  The answer is D: They generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:

Option C: There is no indication that either author would agree with this statement.
Option D: Both passages suggest that women generally had fewer rights than men in the eighteenth century.
Thought: 
  Both passages argue for greater rights and opportunities for women.

  Passage 2 argues that women, like men, have the gift of reason, yet are denied the rights to use it.
  Both passages imply that women are not treated equally to men in society.
  Therefore, the authors of both passages would most likely agree with option D.
  The answer is D: They generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues against the political participation of women.
  Passage 2 argues for the education of women and their right to participate in politics.
Thought: 
  Both passages refer to women's rights and their role in society in the eighteenth century.
  Passage 1 argues against women's political participation and portrays them as having "delicate constitutions" and "peaceful inclinations."
  Passage 2, on the other hand, argues that women must be educated and treated as equals, arguing for their right to participate in politics on an equal basis with men.
  Therefore, the authors of both passages would likely agree that women generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did in the eighteenth century.
  The answer is D: They generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis of the passages and conclusion is correct.
  Therefore, there is no significant criticism to be made.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that women should not have political rights.
  Passage 2 argues for women's rights and education. 
Thought: 
  Passage 1 claims that women were not suited for political rights due to their delicate constitutions, peaceful inclinations, and the duties of motherhood. This indicates that women in the eighteenth century generally did not have political rights and that men and women had different natural preferences.
  Passage 2 argues that women needed education to become the companion of man, to co-operate, and understand why they should be virtuous. This suggests that women's education was lacking in the eighteenth century.
  Therefore, the authors of both passages would most likely agree that women in the eighteenth century generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.
  The answer is D: They generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 argues for the exclusion of women from political rights and functions.
  Passage 2 argues for the education and empowerment of women, and for their inclusion in political rights and functions.
Thought:
  Both passages discuss the role and rights of women in the eighteenth century.
  Passage 1 argues for women's exclusion from political rights and functions, based on their delicate constitutions and peaceful inclinations.
  Passage 2 argues for women's education and empowerment, and for their inclusion in political rights and functions so that they can contribute to society and improve their own lives.
  Both passages acknowledge that women did not have the same rights as men.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely agree with statement D: They generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.
Criticism:
  There is no direct statement in either passage about women's natural preferences or their level of happiness compared to men.
  However, both passages imply that women were excluded from certain opportunities and rights that men enjoyed, which suggests that they had fewer rights overall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that women should not aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions, and that their interests are best served by gentle occupations and the cares of the home. 
  Passage 2 argues that women need education to become companions of men and to progress knowledge and virtue. Moreover, the author contends that is unjust to subjugate women by denying them civil and political rights.
Thought: 
  Both passages acknowledge that women had fewer rights than men.
  The authors of the passages would most likely agree with option D that women generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.
Criticism: 
  The discussion in both passages is limited to the topic of women's rights in the eighteenth century. 
  It does not provide enough information to determine if women's natural preferences were the same as those of men or if they were just as happy in life as men were.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  \section{Passage 1} argues that women should not have political rights because it is not in their nature and it is best for the happiness of all that they focus on domestic duties. 
  \section{Passage 2} argues that denying women education and political rights limits their potential and prevents them from contributing to society.
  A: Neither passage discusses women's natural preferences or whether they are the same as men's.
  B: \section{Passage 2} argues that women need education to contribute to society and that knowledge should be common to all genders. 
  C: Neither passage states that women are as happy as men. 
  D: \section{Passage 1} explicitly acknowledges that women are excluded from participation in government and public employment, while \section{Passage 2} argues against denying women civil and political rights. Therefore, it is most likely that the authors of both passages would agree that women in the eighteenth century generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.
Thought: 
  Both passages discuss the situation of women in the eighteenth century. 
  \section{Passage 1} argues for denying women political rights because of their nature and domestic duties. 
  \section{Passage 2} argues for giving women education and political rights because this will benefit society.
  However, both passages recognize that women in the eighteenth century generally had fewer rights than men did. 
  Therefore, the authors of both passages would most likely agree with statement D: women generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.
Criticism: 
  This answer is justified by the passage's contents. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that women should not be allowed to participate in government or seek political rights.
  The author of Passage 1 believes that women should focus on the "gentle occupations and the cares of the home."
  Passage 2 argues that women should have the same rights as men and be educated to understand "the true principle of patriotism."
  Both passages are discussing the role and treatment of women in the eighteenth century.
Thought: 
  Passage 1 argues that women should not participate in government, which suggests they had fewer rights than men.
  Passage 2 argues for equal rights and educating women, which also suggests that women did not have equal rights or educational opportunities in the eighteenth century.
  Both passages imply that women were not considered equal to men in society.
  Therefore, the authors of both passages would most likely agree that women generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did in the eighteenth century.
  The answer is D: They generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.
Criticism: 
  There is nothing in the passages that speaks to the natural preferences of women being the same as men or their happiness level compared to men.
  While Passage 2 argues for educated and informed women, it is not the main topic of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 argues that it is not in women's interest to have political rights, and suggests that women are best suited for gentle occupations and the cares of home. 
  Passage 2 argues for women's rights, claiming that they need education to be virtuous and to stop the progress of knowledge and virtue. 
  A: There is no mention of whether women's natural preferences are the same as men's in either passage. 
  B: Passage 2 argues that women need education to be successful in society, which implies that they may not have had access to such education in the eighteenth century. This idea is consistent with the historical context of the time. 
  C: There is no clear agreement or disagreement with this statement in either passage. 
  D: Both passages suggest that women generally had fewer rights than men did in the eighteenth century. Passage 1 argues that half the human race (women) is excluded from participation in government, while passage 2 argues for women's civil and political rights, which suggests that they did not have them in the past.
Thought: 
  Both passages discuss women's rights and their exclusion from participation in various aspects of society, which implies that women had fewer rights than men in the eighteenth century.
  Passage 2 argues that women need education to be successful in society, suggesting that access to education may not have been equal between the genders.
  Therefore, choice D is most likely the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  Nothing in either passage explicitly states that women had fewer rights than men in the eighteenth century.
  Passage 1 argues that it is not in women's interest to have political rights, but it does not make a broader claim about gender inequality.
  Passage 2 argues for women's rights, but it does not provide a clear picture of the state of women's rights in the eighteenth century.
  Nevertheless, the emphasis on women's exclusion from various aspects of society in both passages suggests that choice D is the most likely answer.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.
Question: Which statement about striped cucumber beetles can most reasonably be inferred from the passage?
Choices:
  A: They feed primarily on Texas gourd plants.
  B: They are less attracted to dimethoxybenzene than honey bees are.
  C: They experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease.
  D: They are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the role of striped cucumber beetles in relation to Texas gourd plants.
  A: The passage does not make a definitive statement about whether striped cucumber beetles feed primarily on Texas gourd plants.
  B: The passage does not compare whether beetles are less or more attracted to dimethoxybenzene than honey bees are.
  C: The passage states that striped cucumber beetles transmit bacterial wilt disease, which can kill an entire plant in a few days.
  D: The passage states that squash bees are attracted to the compound dimethoxybenzene in Texas gourd scent, but it does not definitively state that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound.
Thought:
  The passage states that striped cucumber beetles are "among the very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants.
  The beetles chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the bacterial wilt disease.
  The passage provides information on how to attract pollinators and repel the beetles.
  However, it does not definitively state whether beetles are attracted to the same compound or not. 
  Therefore, the most reasonable inference is that: Striped cucumber beetles cause significant damage and transmit bacterial wilt disease to Texas gourd plants.
  The answer is C: They experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease.
Criticism:
  None of the answer choices precisely describe the inferred statement.
  Therefore, I must select the most reasonable inference. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes striped cucumber beetles as "very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants, because they damage flowers, chew up pollen and petals, defecate in flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  The passage mentions that honey bees and specialized squash bees are the main pollinators of Texas gourd plants.
  The passage describes an experiment in which researchers increased the scent of Texas gourd flowers with the compound 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
  The passage explains that increased scent did not attract more pollinators and actually resulted in reduced pollination, likely due to the presence of more beetles.
Thought:
  The passage does not mention striped cucumber beetles feeding primarily on Texas gourd plants or being attracted to dimethoxybenzene.
  The passage describes striped cucumber beetles as "very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants.
  The passage does not mention that striped cucumber beetles experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease.
  The passage does not mention whether striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: They feed primarily on Texas gourd plants. 
  This is not mentioned in the passage, so it may not be entirely accurate, but it is the most reasonable inference out of the given choices.
Criticism:
  While the passage states that striped cucumber beetles are "very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants, it does not specifically state that they feed primarily on Texas gourd plants. 
  It is possible that they feed on other plants as well, so choice A may not be entirely accurate.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Striped cucumber beetles are "very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants.
  These beetles chew up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  A: There is no information in the passage that specifies whether striped cucumber beetles feed primarily on Texas gourd plants.
  B: The passage states that squash bees respond to the floral scent of Texas gourd, and specifically to the compound 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, which is abundant in the scent. There is no information about whether beetles are less attracted to this compound than honey bees are.
  C: The passage does not suggest that striped cucumber beetles experience only minor negative effects from carrying bacterial wilt disease. In fact, they are described as a very destructive force for Texas gourd plants.
  D: The passage does suggest that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are. This is described as a problem, since advertising to pollinators also attracts pests like these beetles.
Thought: 
  The context suggests that the striped cucumber beetle is a significant threat to the Texas gourd plant and its pollinators.
  The passage describes the ways in which these beetles are harmful, and the efforts of researchers to minimize their impact.
  While there is no explicit statement about the feeding preferences or odor attraction of striped cucumber beetles, there is evidence to suggest that they are attracted to the same compounds in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
  Therefore, Answer("D"): "They are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are" is the most reasonable inference to make based on the passage. 
Criticism: 
  None
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the behavior of striped cucumber beetles in relation to Texas gourd plants.
  A: There is no evidence in the passage to support or refute this statement.
  B: There is no evidence in the passage to support or refute this statement.
  C: The passage suggests that striped cucumber beetles transmit bacterial wilt disease, but it does not provide information on the extent of the negative effects they experience as a result.
  D: The passage indicates that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the scent of Texas gourd plant, but it does not specify whether they are attracted to the same compound in the scent as squash bees are.
Thought:
  The passage describes the behavior of striped cucumber beetles in relation to Texas gourd plants.
  The passage suggests that striped cucumber beetles are very harmful to Texas gourd plants.
  The passage indicates that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the scent of Texas gourd plants.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
  The answer is D: They are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
Criticism:
  Your inference is reasonable based on the information given about beetles being attracted to the same scent as squash bees. 
  However, the passage does not explicitly state this information, it is only suggested from the results of the study.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses striped cucumber beetles and their negative impact on Texas gourd plants.
Thought: 
  The passage describes how the striped cucumber beetles are among the "very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants, as they eat up pollen and petals, defecate in the flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  The passage does not suggest that they feed solely on Texas gourd plants, so A is not a reasonable inference.
  While the passage describes the compounds in Texas gourd scent that attract honey bees and squash bees, it does not state that the beetles are less attracted to dimethoxybenzene than the bees are, so B is not a reasonable inference.
  The passage does not suggest that the beetles experience only minor negative effects from carrying bacterial wilt disease, so C is not a reasonable inference.
  The passage does describe how the aroma of Texas gourd scent includes 10 compounds and that only 1, 4-dimethoxybenzene lures squash bees into traps, but it does not suggest that this is the same compound that attracts the beetles, so D is not a reasonable inference.
  None of the answer choices are reasonable inferences.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the role of striped cucumber beetles in the pollination process of Texas gourd plants.
  A: There is no evidence to suggest that striped cucumber beetles solely feed on Texas gourd plants.
  B: The passage does not compare the attraction of dimethoxybenzene between striped cucumber beetles and honey bees.
  C: The passage describes striped cucumber beetles as "very bad guys" because they chew up pollen and petals, defecate in flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease.
  D: The passage implies that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
Thought:
  The passage describes striped cucumber beetles as having several negative effects on Texas gourd plants, including transmitting a bacterial infection and damaging flowers.
  The passage suggests the beetles are attracted to the same compound in the plant's scent that attracts squash bees.
  Therefore, the most reasonable inference is that striped cucumber beetles can negatively impact the pollination process of Texas gourd plants by damaging flowers and potentially deterring honey bees from visiting the flowers.
  The answer is D: They are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
Criticism: 
  This inference is reasonable based on the evidence presented in the passage.
  To fully confirm this inference, additional research would be needed to directly investigate the attraction of striped cucumber beetles to compounds in Texas gourd scent.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
   Striped cucumber beetles are one of the pests that attack Texas gourd plants.
   The Texas gourd vine's main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent.
   The aroma includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant lively attracts squash bees into traps is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
Thought:
   The passage states that striped cucumber beetles are pests that attack Texas gourd plants.
   There is no information in the passage about the comparative attraction levels to dimethoxybenzene for honey bees and beetles.
   The passage describes the negative impacts of striped cucumber beetles, such as chewing pollen and petals and transmitting bacterial wilt disease, on the Texas gourd.
   The passage does not provide information on whether or not beetles are also attracted to 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
   Therefore, the best answer is: A: They feed primarily on Texas gourd plants.
Criticism:
   There is no direct statement in the passage that indicates striped cucumber beetles feed primarily on Texas gourd plants. However, the passage does say that beetles are among the very bad guys for Texas gourd plants, meaning they are pests that can do significant harm. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that they feed primarily on Texas gourd plants.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Texas gourd plant and the issues it faces with pollinators and striped cucumber beetles.
  A: The passage mentions that striped cucumber beetles are "very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants, but it does not suggest that they feed primarily on Texas gourd plants.
  B: The passage does not provide information on whether striped cucumber beetles are attracted to dimethoxybenzene or how they compare to honey bees in this regard.
  C: The passage suggests that striped cucumber beetles are a major problem for Texas gourd plants, as they damage flowers, transmit bacterial wilt disease, and reduce plant reproduction.
  D: The passage suggests that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same scent compound in Texas gourd as squash bees are.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that striped cucumber beetles are a major problem for Texas gourd plants.
  The passage does not suggest that striped cucumber beetles are less attracted to dimethoxybenzene than honey bees are, nor does it suggest that they feed primarily on Texas gourd plants.
  The passage does suggest that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same scent compound in Texas gourd as squash bees are.
  Therefore, the most reasonable statement that can be inferred from the passage is D: They are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage suggests that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same scent compound in Texas gourd as squash bees are.
  However, the passage suggests that striped cucumber beetles are a major problem for Texas gourd plants, not that they experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the effects of striped cucumber beetles on Texas gourd plants.
  A: The passage does not state that striped cucumber beetles only feed on Texas gourd plants.
  B: The passage does not provide information on the relative attraction of striped cucumber beetles to dimethoxybenzene compared to honey bees.
  C: The passage describes striped cucumber beetles as "very bad guys" for Texas gourd plants, as they chew up pollen and petals, defecate in flowers, and transmit bacterial wilt disease which can destroy an entire plant.
  D: The passage states that 1,4-dimethoxybenzene is the compound that lures squash bees into traps, and that researchers made half of the Texas gourd plants more fragrant with dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs.
Thought:
  Striped cucumber beetles are described as "very bad guys" that can destroy an entire Texas gourd plant in a few days due to bacterial wilt disease, chewed petals, and defecation in flowers. 
  The passage does not state that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.
  Therefore, the most reasonable statement that can be inferred from the passage is that striped cucumber beetles have a significant and negative impact on Texas gourd plants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Texas gourd plants attract bees to pollinate flowers.
  Striped cucumber beetles feed on the pollen and petals of Texas gourd flowers and can transmit bacterial wilt disease, which is harmful to the plants.
  The main pollinators of Texas gourd plants are honey bees and specialized squash bees.
  The scent of Texas gourd flowers can attract both pollinators and beetles.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses striped cucumber beetles in the context of their interaction with Texas gourd plants.
  Striped cucumber beetles damage Texas gourd flowers by feeding on them, defecating in them, and transmitting bacterial wilt disease.
  The passage does not state that striped cucumber beetles feed primarily on Texas gourd plants; therefore, A is not the correct answer.
  The passage indicates that both honey bees and squash bees are attracted to the scent of Texas gourd flowers, but does not provide information about how attracted striped cucumber beetles are to the scent; therefore, B is not the correct answer.
  The passage does not indicate that striped cucumber beetles experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease; therefore, C is not the correct answer.
  The passage notes that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to Texas gourd scent, but it does not specifically state that they are attracted to the same compound that attracts squash bees; however, this is the most likely inference based on the information provided in the passage.
Criticism: 
  The passage is not definitive about whether or not striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that attracts squash bees, so this inference may not be 100% accurate.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with tables for two along the walls and tables for four  down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,except for the series of murals depicting the four seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window. Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash register, and ordered his dinner. The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass 10 sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other15 page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears.While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed 20 on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of25 Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in November of the same year, and all the powers engaged in the war on either side sent plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and important assembly ever convoked to discuss and 30 determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and 35 began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma, thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his right thumb) presided over the Congress, and40 Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented France.A party of four, two men and two women, came into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took possession of the center table nearest Lymie.45 The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts which exposed the underside of their knees when they sat down. One of the women had the face of a young boy but disguised by one trick or another (rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against 50 the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for, while they were deciding between soup and shrimp 55 cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was the women's voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women's voices which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them. Fortunately he realized this and went back. 60 Otherwise he might never have known about the secret treaty concluded between England, France, and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress65 were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at the top of page 68 , but before Lymie got halfway through them, a coat that he recognized as his father's was hung on the hook next to his chair. Lymie closed the book and said, "I didn't think you 70 were coming."Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his75 scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button.80 Apparently he himself was not aware that there had been any change. He straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth85 finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of 90 the moon. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five.

Criticism:
  Your analysis is correct that the first paragraph describes the Alcazar Restaurant's location, layout, decor, and the book Lymie reads while eating his dinner.
  However, the main purpose of the first paragraph is not to provide the setting of the passage. Instead, it is to introduce the Alcazar Restaurant as a location and to describe Lymie's position and activity within it to capture the reader's attention and set the stage for the rest of the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is A: introduce the passage's main character by showing his nightly habits.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The first paragraph describes a specific restaurant's setting and decoration.
  The passage mentions Johns Hopkins University and the state of Maryland, but these are not the main focus of the first paragraph.
  The passage does not mention a main character, a date, or an event in detail in the first paragraph.
Thought: 
  The first paragraph tells the reader about a specific restaurant's layout, decor, and atmosphere, including its location on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue.
  The purpose of this paragraph is to provide context for the reader and set the scene for the rest of the passage, rather than to introduce a character or indicate a specific date.
  Therefore, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to convey the passage's setting by describing a place and an object.
  The answer is C: convey the passage's setting by describing a place and an object.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of the passage's main character in the first paragraph, so it cannot introduce the main character by showing his nightly habits.
  Although the passage mentions specific historical events, the first paragraph does not focus on any specific date or period details.
  There is no foreshadowing of an event in the first paragraph, as it simply sets the scene without introducing any plot elements.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The first paragraph describes the Alcazar Restaurant, its location, decoration, and seating arrangement. 
Thought: 
  The first paragraph is describing the setting of where Lymie, the main character, is having dinner. 
  It provides vivid details about the restaurant, such as its location, decoration, and seating arrangement. 
  Therefore, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to convey the passage's setting by describing a place and an object.
  The answer is C: convey the passage's setting by describing a place and an object.
Criticism: 
  You are correct. The first paragraph is not introducing the main character by showing his nightly habits, nor is it indicating the date of the passage. 
  Furthermore, the first paragraph does not foreshadow any specific events that are described later in the passage. 
  Thus, the correct answer is C: convey the passage's setting by describing a place and an object. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The first paragraph of the passage describes a restaurant in detail and introduces the main character, Lymie.
A: The paragraph does not focus on Lymie's nightly habits, but rather on the restaurant's decor and layout.
B: The paragraph includes some period details, but they are not the main focus, nor are they used to establish a specific date.
C: The main purpose of the paragraph is to describe the setting, which is the Alcazar Restaurant. The description includes details about the restaurant's location, layout, decoration, and even the food on the table. 
D: While the paragraph does provide some context for later events, it does not foreshadow any major event that is described in detail later in the passage.
Thought: 
The paragraph is mostly about the restaurant where Lymie is having dinner. 
It describes the place and objects in detail, such as the tables, decor, and the book he's reading. 
It also introduces the main character, Lymie, and gives some information about where he's sitting and what he's doing. 
Therefore, the main purpose of the paragraph is to convey the passage's setting by describing a place and an object. 
The answer is C: convey the passage's setting by describing a place and an object.
Criticism: 
The description of the restaurant's setting and decoration does not provide any objective or subjective feelings about the place. 
It merely presents facts, without conveying a mood or tone that could help set the scene or create atmosphere. 
Also, while the paragraph does introduce the main character, it does not give any information about his personality, motives, or desires.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The first paragraph of the passage describes a restaurant called the Alcazar.
  The restaurant is located on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue.
  The restaurant has a long, narrow layout with tables for two along the walls and tables for four down the middle, and it has an art moderne decoration.
  In the front window the restaurant has sick ferns.
  Lymie sits at a table close to the cash register and orders his dinner.
  He props up his history book against the catsup and the glass sugar bowl.
Thought:
  The first paragraph mainly focuses on describing the setting of the Alcazar Restaurant on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue, which has a long, narrow layout and an art moderne decoration.
  The paragraph also details the seating arrangements inside the restaurant and the ferns in the front window.
  The mention of Lymie is incidental to the primary purpose of the paragraph.
  Therefore, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to convey the passage's setting by describing a place and an object.
  The answer is C: convey the passage's setting by describing a place and an object.
Criticism:
  There is no indication that the first paragraph is intended to introduce the passage's main character or that it has a period detail indicating the passage's date.
  There is also no clear foreshadowing of an event that is described later in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society
Question: Which argument does Parsons use to support her claim about the extent to which political parties can be trusted by voters?
Choices:
  A: Political parties are inherently corrupt because human nature is too easily corrupted by power.
  B: Parties often consolidate their power by making deals with opposing parties.
  C: Political parties always sacrifice their own ideals for pragmatic actions.
  D: Parties typically advance positions that are at odds with the beliefs of many of their members.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the author's experience in the labor movement and her thought processes that led her to embrace anarchism over traditional political socialism.
  A: The argument that political parties are inherently corrupt is mentioned, but it is not cited as support for the author's claim about the extent to which they can be trusted by voters.
  B: There is no mention of political parties making deals with opposing parties as a way to consolidate power.
  C: The author does not make the argument that political parties always sacrifice their own ideals for pragmatic actions.
  D: The passage does not mention parties advancing positions at odds with the beliefs of their members.
Thought:
  Parsons is arguing for the idea that political parties cannot be trusted to manage the social and industrial affairs of society.
  She argues this based on her experience studying the faults, failings, aspirations, and ambitions of fallible humans who make up political parties.
  She believes that even when parties make fair promises to secure public confidence, they will ultimately do what it takes to remain in power, build up a powerful machine, and silence opposition or the party might lose control.
  Parsons is concerned about entrusting the management of all of society's affairs to finite humans who are prone to corrupt use of power.
  Her belief in anarchism stems from the idea that it offers the proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society, which cannot be achieved under government restrictions.
  Based on this, Parsons would likely argue that political parties cannot be trusted to manage society's affairs because they will prioritize their own interests over those of the public.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the author's disillusionment with political parties and belief in anarchism, which opposes any form of authority in society. The author argues that governments, including those led by political parties, have too much concentrated power, which they use to silence the voice of dissent and retard progress. The author also argues that political parties cannot be trusted to manage all aspects of social and industrial affairs.
Thought: Parsons argues against trusting political parties because they are made up of fallible humans who are corrupted by power. She argues that parties will do whatever it takes to stay in power and will crush opposition and silence the voice of the minority to do so. She does not mention parties making deals with opposing parties or advancing positions at odds with the beliefs of their members.
Criticism: While Parsons argues that political parties are more interested in remaining in power than advancing the interests of the people, she does not claim that parties are inherently corrupt or always sacrifice their own ideals for pragmatic actions. Additionally, the passage does not mention parties making deals with opposing parties or advancing positions that are at odds with the beliefs of their members.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author opposes entrusting the management of society's affairs to political parties.
Thought:
  The author's opposition to entrusting the management of society's affairs to political parties is due to her belief that human beings will abuse power when they possess it.
  She argues that political parties possess too much power, and they will use this power to silence unpopular opinions and protestations, regardless of their initial fair promises to the people.
  Therefore, she implies that voters cannot trust political parties to manage society in the best interests of all its members.
  Choice A captures the author's argument and supports the claim that political parties are corrupt because human nature is too easily corrupted by power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The author of the passage is discussing her experience with the labor movement and her views on political parties.
  A: The argument is that men will abuse power when they possess it.
  B: The passage does not mention parties making deals with opposing parties.
  C: This argument is not explicitly made in the passage.
  D: The passage does not mention parties advancing positions that are at odds with the beliefs of many of their members.
Thought: 
  The author thinks that political parties should not be trusted to manage the affairs of society.
  She states that power corrupts and that men will abuse power when they possess it.
  Therefore, she does not believe that political parties can be trusted to use their power for the betterment of society.
  The argument that best supports her claim is A: Political parties are inherently corrupt because human nature is too easily corrupted by power.
Criticism: 
  The passage is discussing the author's experience with political parties and her views on Anarchism, but does not make an explicit argument about whether parties can be trusted.
  While the author does state that men will abuse power when they possess it, this argument does not directly relate to the trustworthiness of political parties.
  Overall, the passage does not provide a clear argument that supports any one of the answer choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes Parsons's experience with the labor movement and her disillusionment with the idea that government can be used as a tool to help the oppressed.
  She came to believe that concentrated power wielded by governments can be used to stifle progress and the voice of the protesting minority.
  She argues that political parties cannot be trusted to uphold the interests of the people because they are only interested in maintaining their power.
  Anarchism is the path to the fullest development of individual units in society.
Thought:
  Parsons believes political parties cannot be trusted because they inevitably abuse their power.
  She does not focus on the idea that parties make deals with opposing parties (B) or sacrifice their own ideals (C).
  She argues that parties advance positions that are at odds with the beliefs of many of their members (D) but this is not the main argument she uses to support her claim.
  Instead, she argues that parties are inherently corrupt because human nature is too easily corrupted by power (A).
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the author's experience with political movements and her views on government and political parties.
  A: The passage touches on the idea that human nature can be corrupted by power.
  B: The passage does not mention parties making deals with opposing parties as a reason not to trust them.
  C: The passage touches on the idea that political parties compromise their ideals to maintain power.
  D: The passage does not mention parties advancing positions at odds with their members' beliefs as a reason not to trust them.
Thought:
  From the passage, the author questions the ability and intentions of political parties to lead society.
  She argues that parties are more interested in gaining and maintaining power than in the wellbeing of the people.
  She also believes that concentrated power in the hands of the few leads to the oppression of the many and hinders progress.
  Therefore, it is likely that the author's argument against trusting political parties is that they put their own interests above those of the people.
  Choice C paraphrases this argument, so it is the best option.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Emma Goldman is discussing her views on political parties, and has described her disillusionment with them based on her study of governments and their tendency to use their power to benefit the few at the expense of the many.
  A: This argument suggests that because power corrupts, political parties are inherently corrupt as human nature is too easily corrupted by power.
  B: This argument is not present in the passage.
  C: This argument suggests that political parties always compromise their values for short-term gains, which would not support Goldman’s argument.
  D: This argument suggests that political parties do not truly represent the beliefs of their members, which could support Goldman’s argument that parties cannot be trusted by voters.
Thought:
  Goldman argues that political parties cannot be trusted to advance the interests of the majority. This suggests that parties are more interested in maintaining their own power and advancing the interests of the few than in representing the interests of the many.
  Goldman’s argument suggests that parties cannot be trusted because they do not represent the interests of the people.
  Of the choices given, the argument that best supports Goldman’s stance is that political parties typically advance positions that are at odds with the beliefs of many of their members, making it difficult for voters to trust that parties will advance their interests.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Parties typically advance positions that are at odds with the beliefs of many of their members. 
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Parsons discusses her disillusionment with political parties and her turn towards anarchism.
  A: Parsons does argue that men will abuse power when they possess it.
  B: Parsons does not mention parties making deals with opposing parties.
  C: Parsons does not make this argument.
  D: Parsons does not make this argument either. 
Thought: 
  Parsons argues that political parties should not be trusted because they will abuse their power when they possess it.
  She believes that parties will prioritize staying in power at all costs and will silence voices of opposition by force if necessary.
  Therefore, Parsons supports her claim that political parties should not be trusted because they are inherently corrupt and not interested in the greater good.
  The best answer is A: Political parties are inherently corrupt because human nature is too easily corrupted by power.
Criticism: 
  The above analysis is correct. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the author's experience in the labor reform movement, and ultimately argues that the concentration of power in the hands of government (including political parties) is a mistake. The passage argues that parties in power seek to maintain their own control at the expense of the minority, and therefore the author opposes entrusting any political party with the management of society's affairs. 
  A: The passage does suggest that men will abuse power when they possess it.
  B: The passage does not specifically mention parties making deals with opposing parties.
  C: The passage does suggest that parties act in their own self-interest, but does not say that they always sacrifice their own ideals.
  D: The passage does not discuss parties advancing positions at odds with their members' beliefs.
Thought:
  Parsons believes that entrusting any political party with the management of society's affairs is a mistake.
  She believes that parties in power seek to maintain their own control at the expense of the minority.
  This suggests that Parsons is skeptical of political parties.
  Therefore, she would be likely to use an argument that casts doubt on the trustworthiness of political parties.
  Choice A suggests that political parties are inherently corrupt because of human nature, which could be an argument Parsons would make.
Criticism:
  While the passage suggests that Parsons is skeptical of political parties and their ability to maintain control, it does not necessarily make the claim that parties are inherently corrupt due to human nature. 
  The passage also suggests specific reasons (parties seeking to maintain their own control at the expense of the minority) why the author does not trust political parties to manage society's affairs.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: Parsons is discussing her political perspective and how it has evolved based on her experiences and study. She distinguishes between political socialism and anarchism, and explains why she has turned from the former to the latter.
A: The argument that human nature is too easily corrupted is mentioned in the passage, but it is not clear if this is the main argument used to support the claim about political parties.
B: The argument that parties consolidate power by making deals with opposing parties is not mentioned in the passage.
C: The argument that political parties always sacrifice their own ideals for pragmatic actions is not mentioned in the passage.
D: The argument that parties typically advance positions that are at odds with the beliefs of many of their members is not mentioned in the passage. 
Thought: Parsons mentions the faults, failings, and aspirations of political parties. She indicates that she does not trust parties to manage society's affairs, and argues that parties abuse power when they possess it. Parsons also suggests that parties may use their power to silence opposition and crush dissent.  
Therefore, the argument that seems to be used to support her claim is A: Political parties are inherently corrupt because human nature is too easily corrupted by power.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.
Question: As presented in the passage, Theis and Adler’s research primarily relied on which type of evidence?
Choices:
  A: Direct observation
  B: Historical data
  C: Expert testimony
  D: Random sampling
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Theis and Adler conducted research on Texas gourd vines to determine how to attract pollinators but not attract too many beetles. 
  The research involved planting 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and making half of them more fragrant to determine if extra scent would attract bees while attracting or deterring beetles. 
  The team observed the vines, plucked beetles off of half of the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half of the control flowers to allow the bees to respond with and without interference by beetles. 
  Finally, the team pollinated half of the female flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance and beetles to see if the fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles resulted in reduced pollination.
Thought: 
  The passage states that Theis and Adler conducted research to determine how to attract pollinators while not attracting too many beetles. 
  The research involved planting 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and making half of them more fragrant. 
  The team observed the vines, plucked beetles off of half of the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half of the control flowers to allow the bees to respond with and without interference by beetles. Finally, the team pollinated half of the female flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance and beetles to see if the fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles resulted in reduced pollination.
  Therefore, the primary type of evidence Theis and Adler's research relied on was direct observation.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Theis and Adler conducted research on the Texas gourd plant.
  The research involved testing whether extra floral scent attracted more pollinators or beetles.
  The researchers also wanted to know whether extra beetles would damage flowers and deter bees.
  The researchers planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field.
  The study spanned the August flowering season.
  The researchers made half the plants more fragrant by using dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs.
  The treated flowers emitted about 45 times more fragrance than a normal one.
  The other half of the plants got swabs without fragrance.
  The researchers also plucked all the beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers to allow bees to respond to the blossoms with and without interference by beetles.
Thought: 
  The question is asking what type of evidence did Theis and Adler’s research primarily rely on. 
  From the passage, the researchers planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field.
  Throughout the August flowering season, they made half the plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers. 
  Also, every half hour throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers.
  They observed each flower for two-minute intervals and noted everything down.
  From this, it can be inferred that Theis and Adler's research relied on direct observation.
  Therefore, Answer("A") is the correct choice.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage that suggests that the researchers used random sampling, historical data, or expert testimony.
  Therefore, none of these options can be the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes research conducted by Nina Theis and Lynn Adler on the pollination of Texas gourds.
Thought: 
  The question asks about the type of evidence used in Theis and Adler’s research. 
  The passage describes the research in detail and indicates that the two researchers conducted experiments in an Iowa field in which they manipulated the fragrance levels on Texas gourd vines. 
  Throughout the experiments, the team directly observed the behavior of both pollinators and beetles, and recorded data about seed production and fruit weight.
  Therefore, the primary type of evidence used in Theis and Adler’s research is A: direct observation.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that any other type of evidence was used in the research, such as historical data or expert testimony.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Theis and Adler’s research is described as a recent study about how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles for Texas gourd plants. 
  The research involved manipulating the fragrance of flowers on half of a group of 168 Texas gourd vines to test whether more fragrance would attract more pollinators and/or beetles, and then comparing the pollination success of both groups of flowers.
  The authors gathered data by direct observation and experimentation.
Thought: 
  The passage describes specific details about the methods and observations of Theis and Adler’s research. They planted the Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and made half of the plants more fragrant by tucking swabs treated with 1,4-dimethoxybenzene deep inside their flowers. The researchers plucked all the beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers every half hour throughout the experiments. They also pollinated by hand half of the female flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance and beetles.
  The results of the research show that more fragrance did not attract more pollinators but did attract more beetles. Squash bees were indifferent, and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often than normal ones. Hand-pollinated flowers from fragrance-enhanced plants produced less fruit than those from normal plants due to direct damage from beetles. 
  All of these details suggest that Theis and Adler’s research primarily relied on direct observation and experimentation.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Direct observation.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that Theis and Adler relied on random sampling. The passage describes a carefully designed study in which they manipulated specific conditions in order to gather data.
  There is also no indication that their research relied on historical data or expert testimony. The passage describes the specific methods and results of their research in detail, and it does not rely on external sources of information.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Theis and Adler conducted an experiment to investigate the optimal amount of fragrance that should be provided by Texas gourd flowers.
  The researchers planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and made half the plants more fragrant with 1,4-dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs than the other half.
  Each treated flower emitted about 45 times more fragrance than a normal one.
  The researchers plucked all the beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers.
  Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance and beetles.
Thought: 
  Theis and Adler conducted an experiment to test their hypothesis.
  They observed the behavior of squash bees and honey bees in the presence of flowers with varying levels of fragrance.
  They also manually pollinated flowers to determine fruit development and seed set.
  Therefore, their research primarily relied on direct observation and experimentation.
  The answer is A: Direct observation.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not mention historical data, expert testimony, or random sampling as methods used by Theis and Adler.
  Therefore, A: Direct observation is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Theis and Adler did a study on Texas gourd to attract pollinators without attracting beetles. 
  The study was conducted by planting 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field.
  Half of the plants were made more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers, and the other half was not.
  Each treated flower emitted about 45 times more fragrance than a normal one. 
  They also wanted to know whether extra beetles would impose a double cost by both damaging flowers and deterring bees. 
  So, they plucked all the beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers.
  Finally, they pollinated half of the female flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance and beetles with hand-pollination: this should develop into fruits with the maximum number of seeds.
Thought: 
  The question is asking which type of evidence Theis and Adler primarily relied on in their research.
  Throughout the passage, there is no mention of historical data, expert testimony, or random sampling.
  The researchers conducted direct observations and experiments in their study.
  They observed flowers for two-minute intervals and recorded everything they saw.
  They also conducted experiments where they plucked beetles off of flowers and hand-pollinated the flowers to see whether they develop into fruits with a maximum number of seeds.
  Therefore, Theis and Adler’s research primarily relied on Direct Observation.
  The answer is A: Direct observation.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this question.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.
Question: According to Passage 2, the wild tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed as a result of which factor?
Choices:
  A: Generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete
  B: Limitation to data that are more relevant in certain countries than in others
  C: Reliance on a new experimental tool that has not been thoroughly tested in the field
  D: Assumption of stability in population growth over time that is not supported by data
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a new report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that suggests the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years.
  Passage 2 discusses the methodology used to estimate tiger numbers and range in several countries across Asia, including photographic capture-recapture and large-scale occupancy modeling.
  The WWF and the Global Tiger Forum recently announced to great fanfare that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals.
  But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on flawed methodologies, including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor, according to Passage 2.
Thought: 
  The wild tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed, according to Passage 2.
  The estimate relied on flawed methodologies, including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor, according to the same passage.
  Therefore, the estimate is likely flawed due to relying on weak extrapolations and field counts of spoor as methods of data collection.
  The answer is D: Assumption of stability in population growth over time that is not supported by data.
Criticism: 
  The answer suggested is incorrect.
  While the tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed, it is not because of an assumption of stability in population growth over time that is not supported by data.
  The flawed methodologies used for the estimate, including weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor, are described in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: Passage 2 discusses the flaws in the tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum, including the use of flawed methodologies, such as statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of animal droppings. 
A: Generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete is not specifically mentioned.
B: Limitation to data that are more relevant in certain countries than in others is not specifically mentioned.
C: Reliance on a new experimental tool that has not been thoroughly tested in the field is not mentioned. 
D: Assumption of stability in population growth over time that is not supported by data is also not mentioned.
Thought: The passage specifically discusses the use of flawed methodologies as being responsible for the flaws in the tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum.
Therefore, choice A is the best answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a new report by the WWF suggesting that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been rising over the last several years. If continued surveys prove this to be true, this would mark the first time in more than a century that tiger populations have grown.
  Passage 2 discusses the use of photographic capture-recapture and large-scale occupancy modelling to estimate tiger numbers and range across several countries in Asia. It is suggested that the adoption of these methods by governmental and non-governmental conservation agencies has been slow. A recent example illustrates how reliance on outdated tools can be insidious, and the WWF's tally of the wild tiger population may have relied on flawed methodologies such as extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor. 
Thought:
  Passage 2 discusses how reliance on outdated tools can be detrimental to the accuracy of population assessments in wild tigers. The WWF's tally of the wild tiger population is argued to have relied on flawed methodologies, potentially resulting in inaccurate estimates of the population's size.
  Thus, the answer is A: Generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete.
Criticism:
  The passage suggests that the methodologies used to estimate tiger population size may have been flawed or outdated. However, it is not indicated that this is the sole factor leading to inaccurate estimates. Other factors could include limitations in sample sizes or collection methods used to gather population data.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses the methods used to estimate tiger populations.
  The WWF and the Global Tiger Forum announced that the world’s wild tiger population was at last on the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals.
  The estimates relied on flawed methodologies that included the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor, which were only based on official estimates and were likely incomplete.
Thought:
  Passage 2 claims that the tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may be flawed as a result of generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete.
  The methods used to obtain the estimates may not be rigorous enough, as they include the use of extrapolations and field counts of spoor.
  Additionally, there is uncertainty about the actual population growth of tiger populations over time and in different countries.
  Therefore, it is likely that the wild tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum is flawed due to generalization from incomplete evidence and lack of rigorous methods.
  The answer is A: Generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete.
Criticism:
  You are correct that Passage 2 claims that the tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum is flawed due to generalization from incomplete evidence and lack of rigorous methods.
  However, this applies to the use of extrapolations and counts of spoor, rather than to the limitation of data that are more relevant in certain countries than in others or the reliance on a new experimental tool that has not been thoroughly tested in the field.
  The assumption of stability in population growth over time is also not mentioned as a factor that may contribute to the flawed tiger population estimate.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses how the estimation of wild tiger populations has progressed in recent years. 
  The WWF and the Global Tiger Forum recently announced that wild tiger populations are increasing.
  The methods used to arrive at this conclusion may be flawed. 
Thought:
  Passage 2 suggests that reliance on outdated tools is a factor for the flawed tiger population estimation.
  The methods used by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum may have relied on statistically weak extrapolations and spoor counts. 
  Therefore, the tiger population estimate may be flawed.
  Assuming stability in population growth is not mentioned in the passage, nor is a new experimental tool that has not been thoroughly tested.
  A and B do not seem to accurately describe the flaw discussed in the passage.
Criticism: 
  Answer choice D is close, but it doesn't accurately describe the flawed methodology discussed in passage 2. 
  The answer may be a combination of assumptions of stability and reliance on outdated tools to estimate populations. However, the passage is not conclusive about either of these factors as the primary flaw.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses the flaws in the WWF and Global Tiger Forum's recent estimate of the wild tiger population.
  The estimate of 3,890 wild tigers was based on flawed methodologies and statistically weak extrapolations.
Thought:
  The question is asking about the specific factor that led to the flawed estimate.
  According to Passage 2, the estimate relied on flawed methodologies and statistically weak extrapolations.
  Specifically, the estimate relied on outdated tools and incomplete evidence, rather than the more rigorous techniques now available for estimating tiger populations.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete.
Criticism:
  The answer is accurate based on the information presented in the passages.
  However, it is worth noting that Passage 2 primarily discusses the flaws in the estimate, rather than the factors that led to those flaws.
  While incomplete evidence and outdated tools are mentioned as contributing factors, the passage does not make it explicitly clear that these are the factors that led to the flawed estimate.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:

  The estimate relied on flawed methodologies, such as statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor.
  Based on more rigorous techniques, countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years.
  Therefore, the flawed estimate may have resulted from a limitation of data to certain countries and regions.
  The answer is B: Limitation to data that are more relevant in certain countries than in others.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: Passage 2 discusses the flaws of relying on outdated tools and methodologies to estimate tiger populations. The article mentions that the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum announced that the wild tiger population was on the rise, but the new estimate relied on flawed methodologies and extrapolations. The article suggests that tiger numbers for countries and regions may be speculative and distract from the need to focus on monitoring and growing source populations using the best available science. 

Thought: The question asks about the flaws in the wild tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum. According to Passage 2, the estimate relied on flawed methodologies and extrapolations, suggesting that it may be inaccurate. The article does not mention generalization from incomplete evidence, data relevancy, or untested experimental tools. It does mention an assumption of stability in population growth that is not supported by data, but this does not seem to be the primary factor in the flawed estimate.

Therefore, the best answer is A: Generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete.

Criticism: None.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 2 discusses flaws in the tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out what effect, if any, all that driving around the  labyrinthine streets of London might have oncabbies' brains. When she brought sixteen taxi drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an MRI scanner, she found one surprising and important difference. The right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain known to beinvolved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in the cabbies-a small but very significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of that way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains. The moreyears a cabbie had been on the road, the more pronounced the effect.The brain is a mutable organ, capable-within limits-of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known asneuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons-that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain's basic anatomical structurewas more or less static. Maguire's study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.After her groundbreaking study of London cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to mental athletes. She teamed up with ElizabethValentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic monograph Superior Memory, to study ten individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were-like the Londoncabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners  and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it was possible that they might discover anatomical 45 differences in the brains of the memory champs, evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized themselves in the process of doing all that intensive remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the imaging data, not a single significant structural50 difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects. What's more, on every single test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes' scores came back well within the normal range. The 55 memory champs weren't smarter, and they didn't have special brains.But there was one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects: When the researchers looked at which parts of the 60 brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry. According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be 65 working in overdrive for the mental athletes.Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial70 navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first glance, this wouldn't seem to make any sense. Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in 75 their mind's eye when they were trying to learn three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating like London cabbies when they're supposed to be remembering the shapes of snowflakes?Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes 80 to describe exactly what was going through their minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said they were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, and distributing those images along familiar spatial85 journeys. They weren't doing this automatically, or because it was an inborn talent they'd nurtured since childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural activity that Maguire's fMRIs turned up were the result of training and practice
Question: The passage most strongly suggests that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they
Choices:
  A: exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.
  B: convert information they are trying to memorize into abstract symbols.
  C: organize information into numerical lists prior to memorization.
  D: exercise their brains regularly through puzzles and other mental challenges
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  - In a study of mental athletes, the researchers found that there were no structural differences found between the brains of the mental athletes and control subjects.
  - When memorizing, mental athletes engaged several regions of the brain known to be involved in visual memory and spatial navigation.
  - Mental athletes consciously convert information into images and distribute those images along familiar spatial journeys.
Thought: 
  - Mental athletes are not different from the rest of us in terms of their brain structures.
  - Mental athletes engage several regions of the brain when memorizing information, including regions related to visual memory and spatial navigation.
  - Mental athletes convert information into images and distribute those images along familiar spatial journeys.
  - Therefore, the passage most strongly suggests that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.
  - The answer is A: exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization. 
Criticism: 
  - However, it should be noted that mental athletes might also have regular exercise routines for their brain, which is not mentioned in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses a study of mental athletes who were successful at memorization.
- The researchers found that the mental athletes did not have structurally different brains from control subjects, and their general cognitive ability scores were within the normal range.
- However, when the mental athletes were memorizing information, they activated different regions of the brain compared to the control subjects.
Thought:
- The passage suggests that the mental athletes are successful because they exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization. 
- Specifically, they activate regions of the brain involved in visual memory and spatial navigation, and convert the information they are trying to memorize into images and distribute those images along familiar spatial journeys.
- The mental athletes were not successful because they used abstract symbols or organized information into numerical lists.
- The passage does not mention regular exercise through puzzles or other mental challenges as a factor in the mental athletes' success.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage compares the brains of London cabbies and mental athletes to ordinary individuals through MRI scans and other tests.
  The London cabbies had a larger right posterior hippocampus than normal due to years of spatial navigation in the streets of London.
  Mental athletes appeared to have structurally comparable brains to control subjects, but when memorizing, they engaged different circuitry.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they engage several regions of the brain that are not normally used in routine memorization, such as visual memory and spatial navigation circuits. This is supported by the fMRI imaging data that showed the mental athletes were engaging different circuitry than the control subjects when memorizing.
  The mental athletes also consciously converted the information they were trying to memorize into images and distributed those images along familiar spatial journeys.
  This suggests that mental athletes take advantage of their spatial memory skills to organize and recall information more effectively.
  The passage does not suggest that mental athletes convert information into abstract symbols or organize information into numerical lists prior to memorization, nor does it suggest that they exercise their brains regularly through puzzles and other mental challenges.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- A neuroscientist named Eleanor Maguire studied taxi drivers in London and found that their brains physically altered after navigating through the city's streets.
- The brain is capable of reorganizing and readapting to new kinds of sensory input through neuroplasticity.
- Maguire studied mental athletes to find out if they had structural differences in their brains that allowed them to perform better in memorization tasks. 
- The brains of mental athletes were structurally indistinguishable from those of the control subjects in the study.
- However, mental athletes showed different patterns of neural activity in their brains when memorizing compared to the control subjects.

Thought:
- Mental athletes don't have structural differences in their brains but they use different neural pathways when memorizing compared to the control subjects.
- Mental athletes consciously convert information they want to memorize into images and distribute those images along familiar spatial journeys.
- Mental athletes utilize different parts of the brain in visual memory and spatial navigation, which are not typically used in routine memorization.
- Therefore, the passage most strongly suggests that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.

Answer: A
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a study of mental athletes who excelled in the World Memory Championship.
  The study found that the mental athletes had no significant structural differences in their brains compared to control subjects.
  However, the mental athletes were found to be activating different areas of their brain than the control subjects while memorizing.
  Mental athletes were found to be engaging regions of the brain associated with visual memory and spatial navigation while constructing images to help them memorize information.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the mental athletes are successful at memorization by exploiting parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.
  The mental athletes were found to be engaging regions of the brain associated with visual memory and spatial navigation.
  The mental athletes were consciously converting the information they were trying to memorize into images and distributing those images along familiar spatial journeys.
  This supports the idea that the mental athletes were using their brains in a different way to improve their ability to memorize.
  Therefore, the answer is A: exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the passage describes how mental athletes are successful at memorization by exploiting parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.
  However, the passage does not discuss whether the mental athletes use abstract symbols to memorize or organize information into numerical lists prior to memorization, nor does it mention if they exercise their brains continuously.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The passage discusses a study by Eleanor Maguire, which examined the brains of London taxi drivers and mental athletes. The study found that the posterior hippocampus in taxi drivers was larger than usual, whereas there were no significant size differences in the brains of mental athletes. However, the mental athletes were using different brain regions than control subjects while performing memory tasks, including those related to spatial navigation and visual memory. The mental athletes consciously converted the information they were trying to memorize into images and distributed those images along familiar spatial journeys.
Thought: The passage suggests that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they actively convert information they are trying to memorize into images and distribute these images along familiar spatial journeys. Additionally, they activate certain brain regions related to spatial navigation and visual memory to a greater degree than control subjects do. Therefore, the answer is most likely A: exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.
Criticism: None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses a study that compared the brains of mental athletes and non-mental athletes during memorization tasks.
  The study found that mental athletes activated regions of the brain involved in visual memory and spatial navigation, including the right posterior hippocampus - which was also larger in London cabbies.
Thought: 
  Mental athletes activated different regions of their brains compared to the control group while memorizing.
  Mental athletes consciously converted the information into images along familiar spatial journeys.
  Therefore, mental athletes are successful at memorization because they activate regions of the brain not normally used in routine memorization and use conscious image conversion.
  The answer is A: exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.
Criticism: 
  The study found no anatomical differences in the brains between the mental athletes and the control group, suggesting that it is not simply a matter of structural differences.
  The study did not mention anything about abstract symbols or numerical lists, so options B and C can be ruled out.
  While option D might be a healthy habit, there is no evidence that mental athletes exercise their brains in this way or that it is the reason for their success.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses a study of mental athletes who performed well in the World Memory Championship.
- The researchers found no significant structural differences in the brains of the memory champs compared to a control group.
- However, the mental athletes showed different patterns of neural activity in their brains when memorizing information.
Thought:
- The mental athletes' brains showed increased activation in regions associated with visual memory and spatial navigation when they were memorizing information.
- These regions were less active in the control subjects.
- The mental athletes consciously converted information into images and distributed those images along familiar spatial journeys to aid in memorization.
- Therefore, it seems that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they consciously use parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.
- Option A best reflects this idea.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a study on mental athletes and control subjects to see if their brains are structurally different or just better able to use memory abilities. 
  The researchers used MRI scans to monitor the brain activity of the mental athletes and the control subjects while they were memorizing three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes. 
  The mental athletes described consciously converting the information they were memorizing into images and distributing those images along familiar spatial journeys.
Thought: 
  The mental athletes were found to be engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in visual memory and spatial navigation when memorizing.
  The mental athletes consciously convert the information they are memorizing into images and distribute those images along familiar spatial journeys.
  The passage implies that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization and convert information they are trying to memorize into images.
  Therefore, the answer is A: exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization. 
Criticism: 
  The passage provides evidence that the mental athletes are successful at memorization because of their ability to use visual memory and spatial navigation, as well as their conscious conversion of information into images along familiar spatial journeys. 
  However, while the mental athletes are shown to be using "different circuitry" in the brain than control subjects, the passage does not explicitly state that they are exploiting "parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization."
  Therefore, while A may be the most likely answer, it is not explicitly stated in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes a study that compared the brains of mental athletes to those of control subjects.
  The study found that there were no significant structural differences between the brains of mental athletes and those of control subjects.
  However, when mental athletes were memorizing, they were activating regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects.
  Mental athletes consciously convert information they are trying to memorize into images and distribute those images along familiar spatial journeys.
Thought:
  Mental athletes are successful at memorization because they activate regions of the brain that are less active in the control subjects.
  Mental athletes convert information they are trying to memorize into images and distribute those images along familiar spatial journeys.
  Therefore, the answer is A: exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Large competitors are often viewed as a major.threat for startups and small companies; big.companies have more financial resources and greater.scale, market power and brand awareness than.smaller ones. However, our research finds that a.smaller brand can actually benefit if consumers can.see the competitive threat it faces from a larger.organization..When a U.S.-based ice cream chain with about 1,400 stores moved within 50 steps of a J.P. Licks ice.cream store in Newton, Massachusetts, some people.expected that J.P. Licks, a small, locally owned.company, would be beaten out of the Newton market..But consumers rallied around J.P. Licks, and the.national chain later closed its nearby location. When.the owner of the Los Angeles-based coffee store chain.The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf could not stop a large.coffee shop chain from moving in next door, he was.surprised to see his sales shoot up—so much so that.he started proactively colocating new stores next to.large chain ones..These examples are not anomalies. In six lab and.field studies, we explored the effects of having a large,.dominant competitor and found that highlighting a.large competitor’s size and close proximity can help.smaller brands, instead of harming them. Compared.to when they are in competition with brands that are.similar to them in size or when consumers view them.outside of a competitive context, small brands see.consumer support go up when they are faced with a.competitive threat from large brands. This support.translates into higher purchase intention, more.purchases and more favorable online reviews..As part of our research, we conducted a field study.at an independent bookstore in Cambridge,.Massachusetts. Upon entering the bookstore, 163.prospective shoppers were exposed to one of three.versions of an in-store ad, emphasizing either the.store’s large competitors, small competitors or no.competition. Shoppers who read the “large.competitors” version were told that the store’s main.competitors are large corporations that have the.ability to put small businesses such as this bookstore.out of business. The “small competitors” version.indicated the store’s main competitors are other.locally owned small bookstores in Cambridge. In the.“no competition” version, participants were given no.information about the competitive environment..Shoppers were then given a $5 coupon, coded with.the in-store ad version they read. Analyzing.shoppers’ sales receipts and the number of redeemed.coupons, we found that shoppers were significantly.more likely to make a purchase after reading the.“large competitors” version of the in-store ad,.compared to the “small competitors” version or the.“no competition” version. They also purchased more.items and spent more money at the store, compared.to shoppers reading the “small competitors” or “no.competition” versions. These results suggest that.framing the competitive game and emphasizing a.competitive narrative against a larger company can.help a small establishment—and spur consumers to.make a purchase that supports the smaller.competitor..In subsequent studies, we tested this “framing-.the-game” effect in various contexts and product.categories and further found that support for a large.brand decreases when consumers view it as being in.competition with a smaller brand. In one study, we.asked participants to assess two hypothetical rival tire.shops, “Tire World” and “Tire Planet,” under three.conditions—small vs. large, small vs. small or large.vs. large competitors. While participants indicated no.preference for the small or large shop when it was.competing against a competitor of similar size, the.small vs. large competitive context elicited a strong.preference for the small rather than large shop.
Question: The studies in the passage suggest that if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, a likely result is that the large store would
Choices:
  A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.
  B: gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops.
  C: benefit from people's perception that its competition is now even greater.
  D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the results of several lab and field studies that explored the effects of having a large, dominant competitor. 
  The studies found that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands rather than harming them. 
  In one study, participants who read an in-store ad emphasizing the store's large competitors were significantly more likely to make a purchase, compared to those who read an ad emphasizing small competitors or no competition.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the results of studies highlighting the benefits of emphasizing a large competitor's size and close proximity to a smaller brand. However, the question specifically asks about the effects of giving customers of a large chain bookstore information focusing on the store's small competitors. 
  Based on the studies discussed in the passage, it would seem unlikely that emphasizing small competitors would have a positive effect on the large chain bookstore. Instead, emphasizing small competitors could lead customers to perceive the large chain bookstore as a competitor to the smaller shops and, therefore, lead them to shop elsewhere.
  Therefore, the likely result of customers of a large chain bookstore being given information focusing on the store's small competitors is that the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
  The answer is D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes research suggesting that a smaller brand can benefit if consumers perceive it facing a competitive threat from a larger organization. 
  Six lab and field studies explored the effects of having a large, dominant competitor and found that highlighting a large competitor’s size and proximity can help smaller brands, instead of harming them. 
  Small brands see consumer support go up when they are faced with a competitive threat from large brands. 
  Support translates into higher purchase intention, more purchases, and more favorable online reviews.
Thought:
  The passage describes research that suggests emphasizing a competitive threat from a large competitor can help smaller brands. 
  The article also cites a study of an independent bookstore that found people were more likely to make a purchase when they were told the store's main competitors were large corporations that had the ability to put small businesses out of business.
  Based on this knowledge, if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, a likely result is that the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
  Therefore, the answer is D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
Criticism:
  It is not explicitly stated in the article that customers of a large chain bookstore would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops, but the passage does provide evidence that emphasizing competition with a smaller brand can increase support for the smaller brand.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the effects of large competitors on smaller businesses and conducted several studies to measure the effects.
  The studies suggest that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands.
  In one field study, shoppers who read an in-store ad emphasizing the store's large competitors were significantly more likely to make a purchase and spent more money at the store compared to shoppers who read an ad emphasizing small competitors or no competition.
Thought: 
  The passage provides evidence that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands.
  If customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the small competitors, it is likely that the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
  Therefore, the answer is D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not specifically mention a large chain bookstore, but does mention a U.S.-based ice cream chain and a Los Angeles-based coffee store chain.
  However, the studies show that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands instead of harming them, so it is unlikely that a large chain bookstore would receive more positive reviews or benefit from people's perception that its competition is now even greater.
  It is also unlikely that the large store would gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops, as the studies suggest that support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses research that investigates the impact of large competitors on small brands' sales.
- Six lab and field studies have been conducted in this regard.
- These studies found that smaller brands can benefit if consumers can see the competitive threat they face from larger organizations.
- Consumers are more likely to make a purchase that supports the smaller competitor in such situations.
Thought:
- The question asks about the likely result if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors.
- According to the passage, highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands, instead of harming them. 
- When consumers view large brands in competition with a smaller brand, support for the larger brand decreases. 
- Therefore, if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, a likely result is that the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
- The correct answer is D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
Criticism:
- None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses six lab and field studies that explore the effects of large competitors on smaller brands.
  The studies found that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands rather than harming them.
  Small brands see consumer support go up when they are faced with a competitive threat from large brands.
Thought:
  The studies suggest that if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, the likely result is that the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
  This is because the studies found that small brands benefit when consumers can see the competitive threat they face from a larger organization.
  Therefore, if customers of a large chain bookstore are made aware of the competition from small bookstores, they may choose to support the smaller shops instead of the larger one.
  The answer is D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
Criticism:
  The studies discussed in the passage do not specifically address the reaction of customers of large chain bookstores when given information focusing on small competitors.
  While it is possible that the results of the studies could be applied to this scenario, it is not entirely clear.
  Additionally, the passage does not provide information on how the large chain bookstore would respond to the change in customer perception.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how smaller brands can benefit when their customers see them as facing a competitive threat from a larger organization.
  The research found that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands, instead of harming them.
  The impact of this competitive threat translates into higher purchase intention, more purchases, and more favorable online reviews for smaller brands.
Thought:
  If customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, they would see the store as a large competitor to the small shops.
  The passage suggests that supporting a large brand decrease when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.
  Therefore, if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information about small shops, the bookstore would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
  The answer is D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
Criticism:
  There is no information in the passage that specifically mentions a large chain bookstore.
  The field study mentioned is of an independent bookstore, not a large chain bookstore.
  Although the passage discusses how highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands, it is not clear how this would apply to a large chain bookstore without additional information.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses six lab and field studies exploring the effects of large, dominant competitors on smaller brands. 
  The studies found that smaller brands can benefit when consumers see the competitive threat they face from larger organizations, causing consumer support to increase. This translates into higher purchase intention, more purchases, and more favorable online reviews.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how highlighting a large competitor's size and proximity can actually benefit smaller brands.
  Specifically, a field study was conducted at an independent bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts to see how shoppers' behavior was affected if exposed to different in-store ad versions.
  Analyzing shoppers' sales receipts and the number of redeemed coupons, the team found that shoppers were significantly more likely to make a purchase after reading the "large competitors" version of the in-store ad compared to the "small competitors" version or the "no competition" version.
  Thus, it is likely that if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, a likely result would be that the large store would lose customers who would then see it as a competitor of the smaller shops. 
  The answer is D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops. 
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that the studies found that large competitors actually lose customers when presented with information about smaller competitors, as the studies primarily focused on the effect on smaller brands. 
  However, given the findings of the "framing-the-game" effect, it is reasonable to suggest that customers of a large chain bookstore may indeed be more likely to choose smaller competitors when presented with information emphasizing the smaller stores' competition.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage presents findings of multiple studies that examined the effects of having a large, dominant competitor and found that highlighting a large competitor’s size and close proximity can help smaller brands, instead of harming them.
  The passage also presents a field study conducted in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that found shoppers who read a version of an in-store ad emphasizing the store's large competitors were significantly more likely to make a purchase, purchase more items, and spend more money than shoppers who read a version emphasizing small competitors or no competition.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that highlighting the store's small competitors could help the large chain bookstore. However, the results of the studies focus on the effects of highlighting a large competitor, not small competitors.
  Therefore, it is difficult to draw a conclusion about the likely result of emphasizing the store's small competitors.
  None of the given choices are supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The reading discusses how smaller brands can benefit when consumers perceive the competitive threat they face from larger organizations. 
  Studies showed that highlighting a larger competitor's size and proximity can help smaller brands increase consumer support.
  The study conducted in a bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts, found that shoppers were more likely to make a purchase and spend more money at the store after reading an in-store ad that highlighted the store's large competitors.
Thought:
  The question asks what would happen if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors.
  The studies suggest that smaller brands benefit when consumers perceive a competitive threat from larger organizations.
  Therefore, the large store would likely see a decrease in customer support and sales if customers were given information about smaller competitors.
  Thus, the answer is D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of smaller shops.
Criticism: 
  Your thinking is correct based on the information provided in the passage. 
  However, the passage does not provide any specific information about a large chain bookstore. The passage talks about a study conducted in an independent bookstore in Cambridge. 
  So, answer choice D could be likely if the scenario in the question were to occur, but it is not directly supported by the information in the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses research that found that small brands can benefit from highlighting their large, dominant competitor, which may lead to higher purchase intention, more purchases, and more favorable online reviews.
  The passage also provides an example of a Los Angeles-based coffee chain that saw increased sales after a large competitor moved in next door.
Thought:
  The studies suggest that if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, they might shift their perception of the large store as a competitor of smaller shops, and instead, may be more likely to support the small shops.
  This could lead to a decrease in support for the large chain store and potentially decrease the number of purchases made there.
  The correct answer is D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
Criticism:
  None.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together, to a house divided against itself, and says that it is  contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.When did he learn, and by what authority does he proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased fromfour millions to thirty millions of people; we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population,in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under aConstitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says isin violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government....I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of eachState to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-boundRepublic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire newterritory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just 45 as fast and as far as we need the territory... .\section{Passage 2}In complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship ... he again quotes that portion in which I said that "a house divided 50 against itself cannot stand." Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face55 of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate60 the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the65 house a "house divided against itself." They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?70 Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has75 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
Question: 80 with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now. Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there has been agitation and resistance.... Do you think that the nature of man will be changed, that the same 85 causes that produced agitation at one time will not have the same effect at another? In the first paragraph of Passage 1, the main purpose of Douglas's discussion of the growth of the territory and population of the United States is to
Choices:
  A: provide context for Douglas's defense of continued expansion.
  B: suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
  C: imply that Lincoln is unaware of basic facts concerning the country.
  D: account for the image of the United States as powerful and admirable.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 is a speech by Stephen A. Douglas, a US Senator, about the issue of slavery in the United States.
  Passage 2 is a speech by Abraham Lincoln, a politician and later President of the United States, also about the issue of slavery in the United States.
  A: The passage does not address whether continued expansion is defensible or not.
  B: The passage does address the issue of division into free and slave states, but not specifically to argue whether it endangers the Union or not.
  C: The passage does not imply that Lincoln is unaware of basic facts concerning the country.
  D: The passage provides an account of the growth of the United States in terms of population, territory, and power. 
Thought: 
  Douglas discusses how the United States has grown in population, territory, wealth, and power, presumably to argue that the Union can continue to exist despite the division into free and slave states because of the country's strength. 
  The passage does not directly address whether this growing strength means that continued expansion is defensible, so A is incorrect. 
  While the passage is relevant to the issue of division into free and slave states, this is not the main purpose of Douglas's argument; rather, he is mainly addressing Lincoln's comments about the Union being divided against itself. Thus, B is incorrect.
  The passage does not imply that Lincoln is unaware of basic facts, so C is incorrect. 
  The passage does account for the image of the United States as powerful and admirable, so D is correct.
Criticism: 
  Your understanding of the main purpose of the paragraph is correct.
  There is no significant flaw in your logic or reasoning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 are discussing the issue of slavery in the United States.
  In Passage 1, Senator Douglas argues that the Union can exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as long as each state carries out the principle of State rights and State sovereignty.
  Passage 1 also discusses the growth of the United States in terms of population and territory.
Thought:
  In the first paragraph of Passage 1, Douglas discusses the growth of the United States in terms of population and territory.
  He mentions that the United States has increased in population, wealth, and power beyond any example on earth.
  He argues that the current division into Free and Slave States does not endanger the Union.
  Therefore, the main purpose of Douglas's discussion of the growth of the territory and population of the United States is to suggest that the division into Free and Slave States does not endanger the Union.
  The answer is B: suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
Criticism:
  Your analysis is correct. There is no indication in Passage 1 that Douglas is providing context for a defense of continued expansion, implying that Lincoln is unaware of basic facts concerning the country, or accounting for the image of the United States as powerful and admirable. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is discussing a debate between Douglas and Lincoln about slavery and the Union.
  Passage 1 presents Douglas's argument defending the Union's ability to survive with a divide between free and slave states.
  Passage 2 presents Lincoln's argument against the spread of slavery into new territories.
Thought: 
  In Passage 1, Douglas is discussing the growth of the US population and territory.
  He notes that the US has grown rapidly in population, wealth, and power.
  He attributes this growth to the Constitution and the Union, despite the divide between free and slave states.
  Douglas argues that as long as each state is allowed to govern itself, the Union can continue to expand indefinitely.
  Therefore, the main purpose of this paragraph is to suggest that the divide between free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
  The correct answer is B: suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
Criticism: 
  The growth of the US population and territory is not the main focus of the paragraph.
  The purpose of this paragraph is to defend the Union's ability to survive with a divide between free and slave states, but it is not the only point being made.
  The paragraph also argues that the US can continue to expand and acquire new territories as long as each state can govern itself.
  Therefore, A and D may also seem like plausible answers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 is discussing Douglas's views on the issue of slavery and the Union of states in the United States.
  The passage describes the growth of territory and population in the United States under the Union.
  The passage suggests that the Union can continue to exist if each state carries out the principles of state sovereignty.
Thought: 
  In the first paragraph of Passage 1, Douglas is describing the growth and expansion of the United States.
  He cites an increase in population, territory, wealth, and power as evidence of the success of the Union.
  The purpose of this discussion is to argue that the division of the Union into Free and Slave states does not endanger the Union.
  Douglas believes that the Union can continue to expand as long as each state exercises its right to regulate its own affairs.
  Therefore, the main purpose of Douglas's discussion of the growth of the territory and population of the United States is to suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
  The answer is B: suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage contains a discussion between Douglas and Lincoln concerning the issue of slavery in the United States.
  In Passage 1, Douglas argues that the Union can exist forever, divided into Free and Slave states, as long as each state carries out the principles upon which the institutions were founded.
  He cites the growth of the population, wealth, and power of the United States as evidence that the division between Free and Slave states does not endanger the Union.
Thought: 
  In the first paragraph of Passage 1, Douglas discusses how the United States has increased in population, wealth and power beyond any example on earth under a Constitution and a Union divided into Free and Slave States.
  The purpose of this discussion is to argue that the division of Free and Slave States does not threaten the survival of the Union.
  Therefore, B: suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union, is the main purpose of Douglas's discussion.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 are speeches given by Douglas and Lincoln.
  In Passage 1, Douglas is speaking in defense of slavery and justifying the division of free and slave states.
  In Passage 2, Lincoln is discussing the issue of slavery and the need to prevent its expansion into new territories.
Thought:
  Douglas is recounting the success and growth of the United States, including its acquisition of new territories and increase in population, to support his argument that the Union can continue to exist with free and slave states.
  Therefore, the main purpose of Douglas's discussion is to provide context for his defense of continued expansion.
  The other choices do not accurately reflect the purpose of the passage.
Criticism:
  Your analysis is correct. Douglas's purpose is to justify the division of free and slave states and to argue that the Union can continue to function with this division. He uses the success and growth of the United States as evidence to support his argument. 
  Therefore, the main purpose of the discussion is to provide context for his defense of continued expansion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is a debate between two politicians.
  In Passage 1, Douglas discusses the growth of the United States in size and population.
  In Passage 2, Lincoln responds to Douglas's arguments about slavery.
Thought: 
  In Passage 1, Douglas is arguing that the Union can survive with divided free and slave states if each state is allowed to decide for itself.
  One way Douglas supports this argument is by pointing out the history of the United States, highlighting how the country has grown and prospered despite the division of states into free and slave.
  Therefore, the main purpose of Douglas's discussion of growth is to argue that the divided nature of the Union is not a threat under the principles of state rights.
  Answer: A
Criticism: 
  While it is true that Douglas is arguing for continued expansion and acquisition of new territory, the immediate purpose of his discussion of the growth of the United States is not to provide context for that argument. 
  Instead, his discussion serves to support his argument that the Union can survive divided into free and slave states.
  However, Choice B is a more specific and accurate description of his argument.
  Answer: B
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 is a discussion of Stephen A. Douglas's defense of the idea that each state should regulate its own affairs.
  Passage 2 is about Abraham Lincoln's response to Douglas's defense of the idea that each state should regulate its own affairs.
  A: This choice could be considered too broad and not specific enough to the content of Passage 1.
  B: This choice is a possible answer because Douglas argues that the Union can continue to exist peacefully even if it is divided into free and slave states if each state will carry out the principle of state sovereignty.
  C: This choice is not supported by Passage 1.
  D: This choice is another valid answer, as Douglas lists the growth of population, wealth, and power of the United States to account for its image of being powerful and admirable.
Thought: 
  Douglas mentions the growth of the United States, including the acquisition of new territories, to argue his point on state sovereignty and the continued expansion.
  He believes the Union can exist peacefully even if it is divided into free and slave states if each state will carry out the principle of state sovereignty.
  He seems to justify this argument by listing the growth of the United States.
  Therefore, the main purpose of Douglas's discussion of the growth of the territory and population of the United States is to provide support for his defense of the idea of state sovereignty and the continued expansion of the United States.
  The answer is A: provide context for Douglas's defense of continued expansion.
Criticism: 
  A and D are both valid answers to this question, as the growth of the United States is both an aspect of providing context for Douglas's argument, and an explanation for the image of the United States being powerful and admirable.
  However, A is the better answer because it is more directly supported by the content of the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 are discussing the issue of slavery and the Union in the United States.
  In the first paragraph of Passage 1, Douglas is discussing the growth of the US since its inception.
  A: To "provide context for Douglas's defense of continued expansion" is not an accurate representation of the main purpose of Douglas's discussion.
  B: Douglas does not directly suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
  C: Douglas does not imply that Lincoln is unaware of basic facts concerning the country. 
  D: The last sentence of the first paragraph of Passage 1 does mention the rise in power of the United States, but it is not the main purpose of Douglas's discussion.
Thought:
  The first paragraph of Passage 1 describes the growth of the United States, but the main purpose of Douglas's discussion is not clear.
Criticism:
  Actually, the first paragraph of Passage 1 is part of a larger argument which Douglas makes against Lincoln. 
  In this argument, Douglas seeks to justify the existence of slavery within the constitution of the United States while at the same time preserving the unity of the Union. 
  The purpose of the paragraph thus may be to create a context for that argumentation by drawing attention to the material growth of the United States following its inception, but this does not resonate accurately with any of the options presented by the question.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Douglas is discussing the growth of the territory and population of the United States.
  The passage is part of a debate with Abraham Lincoln.
  The passage takes place during a time when there are free states and slave states in the United States.
Thought:
  Douglas is arguing that the division of free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
  He provides evidence to support this by discussing the growth of the United States.
  He notes that the United States has expanded significantly, acquired new territories, and become more powerful since its founding.
  This suggests that the Union can continue to exist as it is, with free and slave states, without harm.
  Therefore, the main purpose of Douglas's discussion is to suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
  The answer is B: suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
Criticism:
  Your analysis is correct that Douglas is discussing the growth of the United States and using it as evidence that the Union does not need to change in terms of its division of free and slave states.
  However, he is not defending continued expansion overall but rather arguing against changing the status quo of free and slave states.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their  parents. "They jumped up like popcorn," he said, 5 describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. "He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. "I asked 35 him how it went," Ken recalled, "and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' " Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the "aha" moment. "The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively," he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. "It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car," he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)
Question: Which statement best captures Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research?
Choices:
  A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
  B: The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior.
  C: Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest.
  D: Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial designed a project to study how baby game birds learn to fly.
  The project was focused on the Chukar Partridge.
  A rancher advised Ken to give them something to climb on, and Ken realized that ground birds actually prefer to rest on elevated perches.
  Ken discovered that young Chukars used their legs and wings cooperatively to run up inclines, which he called wing-assisted incline running (WAIR).
Thought:
  Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research was that studying how baby game birds learn to fly would shed light on the acquisition of flight in birds' evolutionary ancestors.
  In his experiments, he observed a unique behavior in young Chukars, which led to the discovery of WAIR, a technique that allowed birds to climb vertical surfaces.
  By examining how young birds use WAIR to climb up inclines, Ken could explain the evolution of the flapping flight stroke of birds and the aerodynamic function of half-formed wings.
  Therefore, Ken Dial's research was aimed at finding a viable origin for the evolution of flight in birds, based on the behavior of young birds learning to fly.
  The best statement that captures Ken Dial's central assumption is A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial observed how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds learn to fly by jumping and flapping their wings.
  Rancher in Montana advised that ground birds prefer to rest on ledges or low branches.
  When Ken Dial added hay bales as perches, he observed that baby Chukar Partridges use their legs and wings together to climb.
  Ken Dial used Chukar Partridges as a model species to study how baby game birds learned to fly.
Thought: 
  Ken Dial designed a project to study how baby game birds learn to fly.
  He used Chukar Partridges as a model species.
  He observed that birds prefer to rest on ledges or low branches.
  Therefore, he added hay bales as perches.
  The study found that baby Chukar Partridges use their legs and wings to climb vertical surfaces.
  Ken Dial's central assumption for setting up this research is that understanding how young birds learn to fly provides valuable insights about the acquisition of flight in birds and their evolutionary ancestors.
  The answer is A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention in the context about young birds acquiring flight shedding light on their evolutionary ancestors. 
  However, the context does make clear that Ken Dial's research was designed to study how baby game birds learned to fly, and how understanding animal behavior can provide insight into evolution. 
  So, the most likely answer is A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.

Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial designed a project to study how baby game birds learn to fly.
  The local rancher advised Ken to give the Chukar Partridge hay bales to perch on.
  The Chukar Partridge were observed using their wings and legs cooperatively to scramble up steep inclines.
Thought: 
  Ken Dial's central assumption is not directly stated in the passage, but based on his research and the observations made on the Chukar Partridge experiment, one can infer that Ken assumes:
  The origin of flapping flight stroke of birds was developed using wings to scramble up otherwise impossible slopes which led to the evolution of flapping wings for controlled flight.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide a definitive statement on Ken Dial's central assumption in his research, but rather highlights the discoveries and observations made during his studies on birds.
  While it is stated that the "WAIR" technique developed by Ken may provide an explanation for the origin of the flapping flight stroke of birds, it is not explicitly mentioned that this was his central assumption in setting up his research.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial conducted a research project to study how baby game birds learn to fly by focusing on the Chukar Partridge species. A rancher advised him to add something to climb on to the laboratory setup because ground birds don't like the ground.
  The tendency of young birds to run erratically and flap their wings cooperatively with their legs assisted them to climb vertically.
Thought:
  Ken Dial's central assumption is that young birds' ability to fly could explain the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
  This is because observing young birds in their first hops and flights contributed to understanding young birds' techniques for climbing and how they evolved to fly eventually.
  The climbing technique (WAIR) also gives insight into how half-formed wings were used for aerodynamic purposes.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence to suggest that Ken Dial's central assumption is that "ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel." 
  Furthermore, there is no mention of young birds in a controlled research setting being less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest.
  Option B is somewhat correct as Ken Dial's innovation in method allowed him to debunk the idea that young partridges climb and flap their wings erratically by showing that the behavior was essential for young birds climbing, which helped us understand the evolution of avian flight. However, it doesn't fully capture his central assumption.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Ken Dial studied how baby game birds learn to fly.
- Ken Dial observed how baby ground birds jump and fly.
- Ken Dial's son discovered that baby Chukars could climb thanks to their wings and legs cooperation.
- Dial discovered a new technique called wing-assisted incline running (WAIR).
Thought:
- Ken Dial's research seems to assume that the behavior of baby game birds reflects a natural way of learning to fly, dating back to their evolutionary ancestors.
- The fact that young Chukars could climb vertical surfaces using their wings and legs cooperatively led Dial to discover the WAIR technique and its potential as an explanation for the origin of flapping flight stroke in birds.
- Therefore, Ken Dial's central assumption seems to be that the behavior of young birds in a research setting can provide insights into their evolutionary past.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial designed a project to study how baby game birds learn to fly.
  The rancher supplying Dial with birds suggested to give the birds something to climb on for perching.
  Dial discovered that the birds used wings and legs cooperatively to climb vertical surfaces. He named this technique WAIR.
Thought: 
  Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research was that studying how baby game birds learn to fly would shed light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors. By conducting research that measures their first hops and flights, and their techniques for climbing elevated perches, he would be able to co-relate these observations with theories of avian evolution and the acquisition of flight.
  Therefore, A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors best captures Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage that Dial designed his project to shed light on the acquisition of flight in the evolutionary ancestors of birds. His project was focused on discovering clues on how baby game birds learned to fly by measuring their first hops and flights and techniques for climbing elevated perches in a controlled research setting.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial designed a project to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.
  The cowboy recommended that the birds be given something to climb on.
  Ken Dial observed that all of the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. 
Thought:
  Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research might be that baby game birds acquire flight through a cooperative use of their wings and legs.
  In the wild, all of the species of ground birds that he observed preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators, which suggests that providing artificial perches is necessary to simulate natural conditions.
  Therefore, the use of perches might be important to the ability of young ground birds to learn to fly.
  Option B is incorrect because it is not mentioned in the text that this behavior is recent.
  Option D is incorrect because it suggests that bird ancestors evolved from both ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors, which is not mentioned in the text.
Criticism:
  There could be other possible assumptions that Ken Dial made when designing his research project.
  It is not clear from the text that Ken Dial thought perches are absolutely necessary for young birds to learn to fly.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
Ken Dial set up a project to investigate how baby game birds learn to fly.
He noticed that young ground birds preferred to rest on ledges or low branches.
The local rancher suggested giving the birds something to climb on which led to the discovery of WAIR (Wing-Assisted Incline Running).
WAIR is a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds.
Thought:
Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research was that studying how baby game birds learn how to fly would help shed light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
This assumption seems to be supported by his discovery of WAIR, which provides an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings.
Option A captures this assumption the best.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial studied the mechanics of how baby game birds learn to fly. 
  He settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species and observed that young birds preferred to rest on ledges and low branches. 
  They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. 
  The notion of providing a perch to young Chukar Partridges was suggested by a local rancher in Montana.  
Thought:
  Ken Dial assumed that the addition of perch-like structures would be beneficial to the Chukar Partridges' flight development. 
  He believed that offering an elevated structure would allow their natural instincts to rest on a perch to take over. 
  This might enable them to use their wings and legs cooperatively in their first hops and flights. 
  Therefore, his central assumption was that perch-like structures were fundamental to the development of fledgling birds’ muscles and feathers. 
  The local rancher's input was helpful in Ken Dial’s experiment.
  Therefore, the answer is that Ken Dial believed adding perches would help the birds develop their ability to fly. 
  The closest answer is C: Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest, which is incorrect. 
  The correct answer is: A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
Criticism:
  While Ken Dial's assumption about the efficacy of perches was important to his experiment, the passage emphasizes that his biggest contribution was to the debate around the evolution of flight. 
  Dial demonstrated an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings and came up with a viable explanation for the flapping flight stroke of birds. 
  Therefore, answer choice A is more correct than any other answer choice.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Ken Dial studied the development of flight in young ground birds such as pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other such birds.
  Ken Dial's study revealed that these young ground birds use their wings and legs cooperatively to climb up vertical surfaces, a technique that Dial called "wing-assisted incline running" or WAIR.
  Dial's discovery of WAIR helped in explaining the development of flapping flight stroke of birds and demonstrated an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings.
Thought: 
  In setting up the research, Ken Dial's central assumption was that a pattern he observed in how young ground birds learned to fly would shed new light on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate of how bird flight might have evolved.
  Based on his observation that young ground birds preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators, Dial reasoned that his experiment might be better if he gave them something to perch on instead of having them on the ground.
  After introducing hay bales for the Chukar Partridges to perch on and leaving his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went on a short trip, Ken Dial realized from his son's observation that the young Chukar Partridges were using their wings and legs cooperatively to climb up the hay bales. This single observation opened up a world of possibilities and gave Ken Dial a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds and an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings. 
  Therefore, Ken Dial's central assumption was crucial to his research and provided a viable solution to the ground-up-tree-down debate.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a land whose coast lines would enclose half the  countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between 5 the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people that $\mathrm{He}$ has planted on this soil; a people sprung from the most masterful blood of history; a people perpetually revitalized by the virile ... working-folk10 of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes-the propagandists and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a15 history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future; a history of statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands ... a history of soldiers, who carried the flag20 across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a history of a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century ... a history divinely logical, in the process of whose tremendous 25 reasoning we find ourselves to-day....Think of the thousands of Americans who will pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the Republic's laws cover those islands with justice and safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans30 who will invade ... the Philippines when a liberal government ... shall establish order and equity there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who will build a . . civilization of energy and industry in Cuba, when a government of law35 replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!think of the prosperous millions that Empress of Islands will support when, obedient to the law of political gravitation, her people ask for the highest honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the40 Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great Republic!\section{Passage 2}If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the45 Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability.The Filipinos do not need any encouragement 50 from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated tomake the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, "Give me liberty or give me death," he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.60 Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.$65 \mathrm{Or}$, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are 70 forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or 75 spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so80 low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also85 calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being
Choices:
  A: unrealistic, since most Americans would be unwilling to relocate to distant islands.
  B: deceptive, since economic domination would be the true goal of the American government.
  C: impractical, since the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources.
  D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes a vision for American expansionism and imperialism.
  Passage 2 presents a critique of imperialism and promotes the principle of self-government for all nations.
Thought:
  Passage 2 is critical of American imperialism and argues that imposing foreign domination over other countries is wrong.
  Passage 1 describes an imperialist vision for America, which includes annexing other countries and territories.
  Therefore, it can most reasonably be inferred that Bryan would disagree with the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being naive, since it does not consider the rights of the islanders and promotes imperialism as a means of expanding American power.
  The answer is D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.  
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct. The answer is D. There are no flaws in your facts or logic regarding the problem. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 advocates for an American empire, where the US governs other lands and establishes liberty and law there.
  Passage 2 criticizes American imperialism and advocates for self-government.
Thought: 
  The question asks what Bryan, the author of Passage 2, thinks of Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories.
  In Passage 2, Bryan criticizes those who hold the view of imperialism--those who believe in governing others without their consent.
  In Passage 1, Beveridge argues that America should govern other lands and establish liberty and order there.
  Therefore, Bryan would criticize Beveridge's vision as an example of imperialism.
  The answer is D: naive since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.
Criticism: 
  There is no reason to believe that Bryan would criticize Beveridge's vision for any of the other reasons listed.
  Furthermore, there is no evidence in either passage to suggest that the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 asserts American imperial superiority in colonizing various territories, such as Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippines, through just and liberal governance. It celebrates the past successes of the United States in expanding its influence and wealth in different parts of the world.  
  Passage 2 argues for the principles of self-government as embodied in the Declaration of Independence, opposes imperialism, and supports the anti-imperialist struggles of the Filipinos.
Thought:
  Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 because he opposes imperialism and supports the right to self-government of the Filipinos. 
  Passage 2 suggests that instead of imposing American governance on the Filipinos and other subject races, the United States should respect their rights to liberty and choose self-government, which aligns with Bryan's position of anti-imperialism.
  Therefore, Bryan would criticize Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories for being naive, since Beveridge implies that the American governance would be just and beneficial to the islanders.
  The answer is D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.
Criticism:
  Your thought process and the answer are correct given the information provided in the passages.
  However, it is important to note that the passages do not explicitly refer to the islanders objecting to American governance or suggest who else might be against the vision of American governance of island territories in Passage 1. Nevertheless, Bryan's opposition to imperialism and support for the principle of self-government imply that he would be against the view that the United States can impose its governance on other peoples in a just and noble way as expressed in Passage 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses America's potential to govern other territories like the Philippines, Hawaii, Cuba, and Porto Rico.
  Passage 2 discusses the idea of American imperialism, and argues that it is contrary to the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence.
Thought:
  The question asks about Bryan's likely opinion of the vision of American governance that Beveridge presents in Passage 1.
  Beveridge argues that America should expand its governance to overseas territories.
  Bryan argues that imperialism is contrary to American principles.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Bryan would criticize Beveridge's vision as being naive and contrary to American principles.
  Answer: D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.
Criticism:
  None.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes the nobility of America as a land and the power of its people. It also mentions the potential for America to expand its reach beyond its current borders.
  Passage 2 argues that if the United States wants to govern the Philippines and other territories indefinitely, it needs to defend that policy. It also argues that America's history of fighting for liberty runs counter to imperialism.
Thought: 
  Both passages discuss the relationship between the United States and the territories it could control. However, they present different perspectives on that relationship.
  Passage 1 argues that America has a noble destiny that includes governing territories across the world.
  Passage 2 argues that America's history is one of opposing foreign domination, and that history should inform its future policies.
  Bryan criticizes the idea of American governance of the Philippines in Passage 2, so it is reasonable to infer that he would criticize the vision Beveridge presents in Passage 1.
  Based on Bryan's criticism, it can be inferred that he would argue that Beveridge's vision is naive because the people of the territories would object to being governed by Americans.
  Therefore, the answer is D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans. 
Criticism: 
  It is possible that Bryan would object to American governance of the territories for reasons beyond the objection of the islanders. However, given the content of Passage 2, it seems unlikely that he would criticize Beveridge's vision for other reasons.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 presents a view of American imperialism and its benefits.
  In Passage 2, Bryan is criticizing the Republican Party's plans for American governance of island territories.
Thought: 
  Bryan believes that the Republican Party's plans for American governance of island territories go against the principles of the Declaration of Independence and self-government.
  He notes that the Filipinos do not want foreign domination, and that the principle of self-government is important in the U.S.
  Therefore, he would criticize Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories as being naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.
  The answer is D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 advocates for American governance of various territories including Hawaii, Porto Rico, the Philippines and Cuba and presents an imperialistic vision of American destiny.
  Passage 2 expresses disagreement with the idea of American imperialism and asserts that the Filipinos have the right to resist any foreign domination.
Thought:
  Passage 2 is critical of the idea of American governance of territories like the Philippines that is being advocated in Passage 1.
  Passage 2 states that any policy of American domination would be resisted by the subject races to the extent of their ability.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories presented in Passage 1 as being naive since the subject races would object to being governed by Americans.
  The answer is D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.
Criticism:
  The answer D is correct based on the information given in the passages.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 argues that the United States has a duty to govern its overseas territories and spread American institutions.
  Passage 2 argues that if the United States adopts an imperialist policy, subject peoples will resist and the American commitment to self-government will be weakened.
  A: This answer is not supported by either passage.  
  B: This is not the main argument of Passage 2, which is about the effects of colonialism and the importance of self-government. 
  C: This is not the main argument of Passage 2, which does not mention resource distribution on different islands.
  D: This answer is supported by Passage 2, which suggests that if the United States tries to "hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies," the subject peoples will resist.
Thought:
  Passage 2 directly comments on the argument Beveridge makes in Passage 1.
  Passage 2 argues that if Beveridge's vision of American governance were put into effect, the subject peoples would resist.
  Passage 2 implies that Beveridge is naive to think that the United States can successfully govern overseas territories without facing resistance.
  Therefore, the answer is D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.
Criticism: 
  The answer is a reasonable inference from the text. 
  However, it is important to note that Passage 2 only specifically refers to Beveridge's views on governing the Philippines, not other territories or countries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: Passage 1 praises the United States as a "greater England with nobler destiny" that should colonize and govern other territories, including Puerto Rico and the Philippines. In Passage 2, Bryan criticizes the Republican Party's support for American imperialism and condemns the idea of American governance of colonies and territories. 
Thought: Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being imperialist and against the principles of self-government and liberty. He argues that the Filipinos and other subject people desire self-government and that colonialism would be harmful to both the colonized and to American democratic governance at home. 
Therefore, the answer is D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 describes the United States as a "greater England with a nobler destiny," with a "mighty people" planted on a "mighty" land, and highlights the potential of American expansion to bring liberty to far-off territories.
  Passage 2 argues that taking on territories like the Philippines as American colonies would violate the principles of self-government outlined in the Declaration of Independence, and that the legacy of this kind of imperialism would be one of "perpetual hatred."
Thought: 
  Passage 2 is critiquing the idea presented in Passage 1 that the United States should govern colonies like the Philippines; it argues that this would contradict American values and inspire hatred towards the US.
  Therefore, Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories presented in Passage 1 for being naive, as the display of American power abroad would only inspire hatred. Choice D is correct.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.
Question: One central theme of the passage is that
Choices:
  A: expanding legal rights of citizens will not necessarily improve national health outcomes.
  B: human rights initiatives should generally receive more funding than health initiatives do.
  C: human rights should be used as a framework for government policy on indigenous issues.
  D: focusing on indigenous peoples’ rights detracts from the more practical concerns of indigenous communities.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the flaws in the approach of considering a focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' rights as taking away from addressing their disadvantage.
- The passage argues that poverty, health, education, and employment are human rights issues.
- The passage criticizes the previous government's emphasis on "record levels of expenditure" without explaining what has been achieved.
- The author argues that a practical approach to issues has lacked accountability and advocates redefining and understanding issues as human rights issues.
- The passage cites a statement of intent signed by governmental and non-governmental organizations committing to close the gap in health inequality and addressing the social determinants that impact achieving health equality.
Thoughts:
- The central theme of the passage appears to be advocating for the use of a human rights perspective as a framework for government policy on indigenous issues.
- This is supported by the discussion of poverty, health, education, and employment as human rights issues and the argument that a practical approach has lacked accountability.
- The passage cites the example of the statement of intent as a template for the type of approach needed across all areas of poverty, marginalization, and disadvantage experienced by Indigenous peoples.
Conclusion: 
The answer is C: human rights should be used as a framework for government policy on indigenous issues. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that a focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' rights is necessary to address their disadvantage.
  The author critiques the "practical measures" approach to addressing Indigenous issues.
  The author supports using human rights as a framework for government policy on Indigenous issues.
Thought: 
  The author presents a critique of the "practical measures" approach to addressing Indigenous issues and instead advocates for the use of human rights as a framework for government policy. 
  Specifically, the author argues that framing these issues as human rights issues allows Indigenous peoples to express their legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and protections under the law, providing a standard for the government to measure up to and holding the government accountable. 
  The passage discusses the recent commitments made by the Australian government to close the gap in Indigenous health inequality using a human rights-based approach as a template for other areas of disadvantage experienced by Indigenous peoples.
  Therefore, one central theme of the passage is that human rights should be used as a framework for government policy on Indigenous issues.
  The answer is C: human rights should be used as a framework for government policy on Indigenous issues.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that focusing on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights and addressing their disadvantage are not mutually exclusive. In fact, human rights can help address issues related to health, housing, education, and unemployment while holding government accountable. The author critiques the previous government's focus on "record levels of expenditure" and "practical measures" for Indigenous issues, which lacked accountability and did not engage Indigenous peoples. The author advocates for a shift towards a human rights framework to address poverty, marginalization, and disadvantage experienced by Indigenous peoples. 
Thought: 
  The main theme of the passage is that human rights should be used as a framework for government policy on Indigenous issues. The author argues that practical measures without accountability and engagement with Indigenous peoples have not been effective in addressing longstanding issues of poverty and marginalization. The author suggests that a focus on human rights can provide a means for Indigenous peoples to express legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and protections of the law, as well as hold governments accountable. 
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence to support option A. The author does not mention legal rights independently improving national health outcomes. There is no mention of option B, funding, in the passage either. Option D is partially true as the author critiques focusing solely on practical measures, but the passage suggests that focusing on human rights can lead to more effective policy development and progress. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the flaws of previously adopted 'practical measures' approach to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage and suggests that human rights should be adopted as a framework for developing government policies that will adequately address these issues. The passage also highlights that commitments to close the gap in health inequality have been made and that this should serve as a template for a more comprehensive approach to addressing poverty, marginalisation, and disadvantage experienced by Indigenous peoples.
Thought: The passage argues that a focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights is necessary for addressing their disadvantage and that human rights should be used as a framework for developing government policies that will address issues related to poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced by Indigenous peoples. Therefore, the central theme of the passage is that human rights should be used as a framework for government policy on Indigenous issues.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.

Choices:
  A: contrast the tool-using behavior of wild and captive-raised woodpecker finches.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.The brains of humans are conspicuously larger than the.brains of other apes, but the human-specific genetic.factors responsible for the uniquely large human.neocortex remain obscure. Since humans split from.chimps, which have brains roughly a third of human size,.the human genome has undergone roughly 15 million.changes. Which of these genetic tweaks could have led to.big brains?.About six years ago, scientists in David Haussler’s lab at.Howard Hughes Medical Institute discovered a gene called.NOTCH2NL. It’s a relative of NOTCH2, a gene that.scientists knew was central to early brain development..NOTCH2 controls vital decisions regarding when and how.many neurons to make..When the Haussler team looked in the official version.of the human genome at that time^1 —version 37—.NOTCH2NL appeared to be located in chromosome 1.near a region linked to abnormal brain size. Delete a hunk.of the region, and brains tend to shrink. Duplicate part of.it, and brains tend to overgrow..“We thought, ‘Oh, this is incredible,’” Haussler said..NOTCH2NL seemed to check all the boxes for a key role.in human brain development. But when the team mapped.NOTCH2NL’s precise location in the genome, they.discovered the gene wasn’t actually in the relevant.chromosomal region after all; the once-promising.candidate seemed to be a dud..“We were downhearted,” Haussler recalled. That all.changed with the next official version of the human.genome—version 38. In this iteration, NOTCH2NL was.located in the crucial region. “And there were three.versions of it,” Haussler exclaimed. Over the last three.million years, his team calculated, NOTCH2NL was.repeatedly copy-pasted into the genome, what he calls “a.series of genetic accidents.”.Genetic analysis of several primate species revealed that.the three genes exist only in humans and their recent.relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, not in.chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. What’s more, the.timing of these genes’ emergence matches up with the.period in the fossil record when our ancestors’ craniums.began to enlarge, Haussler points out. Together, the results.suggest that NOTCH2NL genes played a role in beefing.up human brain size..Passage 2.Modern humans have brains that are more than three.times larger than our closest living relatives,.chimpanzees and bonobos. Scientists don’t agree on.when and how this dramatic increase took place, but.new analysis of 94 hominin fossils shows that average.brain size increased gradually and consistently over the.past three million years..The research, published in The Proceedings of the.Royal Society B, shows that the trend was caused.primarily by evolution of larger brains within.populations of individual species, but the introduction of.new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones also played a part..“Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that.makes us human. It’s related to cultural complexity,.language, tool making and all these other things that.make us unique,” said Andrew Du, PhD, a postdoctoral.scholar at the University of Chicago and first author of.the study. “The earliest hominins had brain sizes like.chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since.then. So, it’s important to understand how we got here.”.Du and his colleagues compared published research.data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13.different species, beginning with the earliest.unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3.2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including.Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size.began to overlap with that of modern-day humans..The researchers saw that when the species were.counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a.common ancestor, the average brain size increased.gradually over three million years. Looking more closely,.the increase was driven by three different factors,.primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within.individual species populations, but also by the addition.of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones..The study quantifies for the first time when and by.how much each of these factors contributes to the clade-.level pattern. Du said he likens it to how a football coach.might build a roster of bigger, strong players. One way.would be to make all the players hit the weight room to.bulk up. But the coach could also recruit new, larger.players and cut the smallest ones..(^1) The reference version of the human genome goes through updates to.more completely map out each chromosomal sequence.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
Both passages focus on the evolution of the human brain size.
Passage 1 states that the brains of humans are larger than other apes such as chimps since humans split from chimps, and NOTCH2NL genes could have played a role in beefing up human brain size.
Passage 2 also talks about the modern human brain size larger than other apes, and the brain size increased gradually and consistently over the past three million years within populations of individual species of hominins.
A: Bonobos are mentioned in Passage 2, but it is not stated that their brains are three times smaller than humans.
B: Chimpanzees are mentioned in both passages as humans' closest living relatives with brains roughly a third of human size. Thus, human brains are about three times larger than chimp brains.
C: Early hominins are mentioned in Passage 2 as having brain sizes like chimpanzees, and brain size increases gradually over three million years until modern humans. Therefore, early hominins had smaller brains than modern humans.
D: Neanderthals are mentioned in Passage 1 as having NOTCH2NL genes in their genome. Still, there is no mention of the size of their brains in comparison to modern humans.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.
Question: It can reasonably be inferred from the passages that their authors would both agree that wild tiger population sizes are
Choices:
  A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
  B: beginning to return to the levels recorded in 2010.
  C: responding predictably to aggressive conservation attempts.
  D: declining steadily despite continual human intervention.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses a new report by the World Wildlife Fund that suggests the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years. The study suggests that the commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. However, while the global number of wild tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country analysis is more sobering. Some countries, including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia may have gone up in recent years, while others have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 acknowledges that although the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has not, whether because of a lack of understanding of or comfort with the new methods or because the old methods cast a more flattering light on their efforts. The authors argue that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be the top priority: guarding and growing the source populations.
Thought: 
  Both passages acknowledge that the global population of wild tigers appears to be increasing, but caution that a country-by-country analysis shows that recovery has been uneven. Conservation efforts in some countries have contributed to overall growth, but some countries have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss. The authors of both passages suggest that it's important to guard and grow the source populations in order to effectively conserve tigers. They would agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
  The answer is A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses a new study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that suggests the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years, and that the commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. However, they also note that counting wild tigers is difficult, and while the global number of wild tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country analysis is more sobering, as some countries have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss. 
  Passage 2 is critical of the methodology used by the WWF and Global Tiger Forum to estimate the number of wild tigers, as it relies on flawed methodologies and weak extrapolations. The author argues that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be the top priority: guarding and growing the source populations.
Thought:
  Both passages acknowledge that counting wild tigers is difficult and unreliable.
  Passage 1 suggests that the overall global tiger population could be slowly rising due to conservation efforts, although a country-by-country analysis is more sobering.
  Passage 2 is critical of the methodology used by the WWF and Global Tiger Forum to estimate the number of wild tigers, and argues that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine conservation efforts.
  Given this information, it can be reasonably inferred that the authors of both passages would agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
  The correct answer is A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passages discuss the wild tiger population and conservation efforts in Asia.
  Passage 1 reports a study that found indication of a slowly rising tiger population.
  Passage 2 criticizes the methods of estimating tiger populations and points out limitations in making claims about global tiger populations.
Thought:
  The passages suggest that tiger populations are not uniformly recovering across all countries.
  While some countries like India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia have seen increases in tiger populations, others like Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have seen their tiger populations decline.
  Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
  The passages also suggest that making claims about global tiger populations is difficult due to factors like the difficulty of tracking elusive tigers and limitations in estimation methods.
  Therefore, it cannot be reasonably inferred that wild tiger population sizes are responding predictably to aggressive conservation attempts.
  There is no mention in the passages that the population is declining steadily despite continual human intervention.
  There is no information to suggest that tiger populations are beginning to return to the levels recorded in 2010.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passages discuss the recent population trends in wild tigers.
  According to the first passage, the population of wild tigers is rising overall, but some countries have seen populations decline.
  The second passage criticizes outdated and flawed methods used to estimate tiger populations.
Thought:
  The first passage suggests that the population of wild tigers may be slowly rising overall.
  However, certain countries have seen some decrease in their tiger populations due to poaching and habitat loss.
  The second passage argues that the methodology used to measure tiger populations is flawed and that more rigorous techniques should be employed.
  Therefore, it can reasonably be inferred that wild tiger population sizes are not responding predictably to conservation attempts and are not declining steadily despite continual human intervention.
  Option A is partially correct, but it doesn't clearly express the fact that some countries have seen population increases while others have seen declines.
  Option B is incorrect since the number of wild tigers reported in 2022 (3,890) is greater than in 2010 (3,200).
  Option C is incorrect as the passages do not suggest that the tiger populations are responding predictably to conservation attempts.
  Option D is also incorrect since the first passage suggests that at least some tiger populations have been growing over the last few years.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 talks about a new study by the World Wildlife Fund that suggests the number of tigers living in the wild has increased over the past several years, which would mark the first time in more than a century that tiger populations have grown. The success of conservation programs in some countries may have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. However, the increased numbers may reflect better surveying methods, and country-by-country analysis shows that some countries have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 discusses how the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, but its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has been slow due to a lack of understanding or comfort with new methods. The author argues that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from monitoring source populations and developing suitable strategies.
Thought: 
  Both passages discuss the need to protect wild tigers and the challenges in accurately assessing their populations. 
  Passage 1 suggests that the tiger populations in the wild have increased over the past several years thanks to conservation programs, while Passage 2 argues that the adoption of new methods for population assessment has been slow and that some estimates, including the official estimates cited by the World Wildlife Fund, may be flawed. 
  Therefore, it can reasonably be inferred that the authors of both passages would agree that wild tiger population sizes are not recovering predictably or uniformly.
  The answer is A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
Criticism: 
  This answer is the most accurate based on the information provided in the passages. 
  However, it is not explicitly stated in either passage that wild tiger population sizes are "recovering," as both passages acknowledge the challenges in accurately assessing the populations. 
  Therefore, another possible answer is "none of the above," but A is the most likely choice. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 describes a new study suggesting that the number of wild tigers may be on the rise due to conservation programs.
  Passage 2 critiques the methodology and goals of some tiger population estimations, and emphasizes the importance of monitoring source populations using sound science.
Thought:
  Passage 1 indicates that conservation programs have been successful in contributing to the overall growth of tiger populations.
  Passage 2, however, suggests that estimates of tiger populations may be flawed and that population growth may not necessarily be occurring in all countries.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
  The answer is A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 talks about a new study by the World Wildlife Fund which suggests that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years. The study suggests that the commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. Passage 2, on the other hand, discusses the flaws in the methodologies used in estimating the wild tiger population.
Thought:
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 have different opinions on wild tiger population sizes.
  Passage 1 suggests that there has been a considerable increase in the global tiger population due to the success of conservation programs in some countries.
  Passage 2, however, argues that the estimates of tiger population sizes based on official methodologies are unreliable and unrealistic. There are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors would agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
  The answer is A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 reports on a new study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) indicating that the number of wild tigers may have been slowly rising.
  The number of wild tigers might have seen a considerable increase to 3,890 from 3,200 in 2010.
  Counting the actual numbers of wild tigers is difficult due to their elusive behavior and scattered habitats.
  While the tiger populations might have grown globally, certain countries have seen declines in their tiger populations due to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 claims that estimating tiger numbers using photo-capture techniques can be flawed and may even undermine conservation efforts.
Thought:
  The authors of both passages seem to suggest that:
  The wild tiger populations are recovering more fully in certain countries, but not uniformly across the globe.
  Although tiger populations might have grown overall, different countries show different results.
  Estimating tiger numbers using photo-capture techniques may have flaws and should be carefully examined.
  The global tiger population number by itself should not be the focus. The focus should be guarding and growing source populations, which requires using the best science available to track tiger numbers.
  Therefore, the answer is A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 provides information about the recent growth of tiger populations across Asia and some of the challenges involved in tracking and monitoring them.
  Passage 2 discusses some of the methodologies used to estimate tiger populations, and expresses skepticism about the accuracy of some of the official population counts.
Thought:
  Passage 1 suggests that tiger populations have shown signs of growth in recent years, but that the situation varies from one country to another. Some countries have seen increases, while others have experienced losses.
  Passage 2 provides reasons for questioning the reliability of official estimates of wild tiger populations. The authors suggest that the focus should be on monitoring source populations rather than trying to establish a global population count.
  Based on these passages, it seems reasonable to infer that the authors would agree that wild tiger population sizes are not recovering predictably across all countries.
  So, the answer is A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 talks about how the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years, which would mark the first time in more than a century that tiger populations have grown.
  Passage 2 criticizes the methodology used by some agencies to estimate tiger numbers, and argues that the focus should be on monitoring source populations using the best science available.
Thought:
  Passage 1 and Passage 2 both indicate that tiger populations have been in decline for years, and that conservation efforts may have recently contributed to a slow rise in their numbers.
  Passage 2 suggests that not all methods used to estimate tiger numbers should be trusted.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
  The answer is A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society
Question: According to the passage, Parsons’s support for anarchism is based on the idea that anarchism
Choices:
  A: distributes wealth and property more equally among the population.
  B: is indifferent to the social status of its adherents.
  C: creates a situation that allows individuals to flourish.
  D: allows people to create an organizational structure whose leaders will champion the rights of the oppressed.

Therefore, the answer is correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how the author, Parsons, became interested in the "Labor Question" during the great railroad strike of 1877. 
  Parsons believed that government could be made an instrument to alleviate oppression but came to understand that governments used their concentrated power to silence opposition and maintain the rule of the few. 
  Parsons believed that concentrated power could always be wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many. 
  Government never leads; it follows progress. Progress moves on only when the voice of the protesting minority cannot be silenced any longer. 
  Parsons believed that political parties, once established in control of society, only sought to remain in power and build a powerful machine to crush opposition and silence murmurs of discontent. 
  Thus, Parsons turned from political socialism to anarchism, believing that in its philosophy, he could find the proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society.
Thought:
  Parsons's support for anarchism is based on the idea that anarchism creates a situation that allows individuals to flourish. 
  He believes that the concentration of power can never be wielded in a way that benefits the many, but rather at the expense of the many. 
  By embracing anarchism, Parsons feels that each individual can be given the space to flourish.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar. In 1789,.the French formed a new governmental body known as the.National Assembly, ushering in the tumultuous period of.political and social change known as the French Revolution..To make a government requires no great.prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach obedience,.and the work is done. To give freedom is still more.easy. It is not necessary to guide; it only requires to.let go the rein. But to form a free government, that is,.to temper together these opposite elements of liberty.and restraint in one consistent work, requires much.thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and.combining mind. This I do not find in those who.take the lead in the National Assembly. Perhaps they.are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather.believe it. It would put them below the common level.of human understanding. But when the leaders.choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of.popularity, their talents, in the construction of the.state, will be of no service. They will become.flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not.the guides, of the people. If any of them should.happen to propose a scheme of liberty, soberly.limited and defined with proper qualifications, he.will be immediately outbid by his competitors who.will produce something more splendidly popular..Suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause..Moderation will be stigmatized as the virtue of.cowards, and compromise as the prudence of.traitors, until, in hopes of preserving the credit which.may enable him to temper and moderate, on some.occasions, the popular leader is obliged to become.active in propagating doctrines and establishing.powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose.at which he ultimately might have aimed..But am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all.that deserves commendation in the indefatigable.labors of this Assembly? I do not deny that, among.an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, some.good may have been done. They who destroy.everything certainly will remove some grievance..They who make everything new have a chance that.they may establish something beneficial. To give.them credit for what they have done in virtue of the.authority they have usurped, or which can excuse.them in the crimes by which that authority has been.acquired, it must appear that the same things could.not have been accomplished without producing such.a revolution. Most assuredly they might....Some.usages have been abolished on just grounds, but.they were such that if they had stood as they were to.all eternity, they would little detract from the.happiness and prosperity of any state. The.improvements of the National Assembly are.superficial, their errors fundamental..Whatever they are, I wish my countrymen rather.to recommend to our neighbors the example of the.British constitution than to take models from them.for the improvement of our own. In the former, they.have got an invaluable treasure. They are not, I think,.without some causes of apprehension and complaint,.but these they do not owe to their constitution but to.their own conduct. I think our happy situation owing.to our constitution, but owing to the whole of it, and.not to any part singly, owing in a great measure to.what we have left standing in our several reviews and.reformations as well as to what we have altered or.superadded. Our people will find employment.enough for a truly patriotic, free, and independent.spirit in guarding what they possess from violation. I.would not exclude alteration neither, but even when.I changed, it should be to preserve. I should be led to.my remedy by a great grievance. In what I did, I.should follow the example of our ancestors. I would.make the reparation as nearly as possible in the style.of the building. A politic caution, a guarded.circumspection, a moral rather than a complexional.timidity were among the ruling principles of our.forefathers in their most decided conduct. Not being.illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of.France tell us they have got so abundant a share, they.acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and.fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus.fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct.attended to their nature. Let us imitate their caution.if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their.bequests. Let us add, if we please, but let us preserve.what they have left; and, standing on the firm ground.of the British constitution, let us be satisfied to.admire rather than attempt to follow in their.desperate flights the aeronauts of France.

Choices:
  A: limit the king’s power.
  B: expand the size of the government.
  C: seek the approval of the public.
  D: ignore the advice of former leaders.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar.
  The National Assembly was formed in France in 1789, ushering in the period of the French Revolution.
  The formation of a government is relatively easy, but forming a free government that balances the elements of liberty and restraint requires deep reflection and a powerful and combining mind.
  Burke does not believe that the leaders of the National Assembly have the necessary qualities to form a free government.
Thought: 
  Burke believes that forming a free government requires much thought, deep reflection, a powerful, sagacious, and combining mind.
  He suggests that the leaders of the National Assembly lack the qualities necessary to form a free government.
  He also implies that their actions may not produce anything beneficial, and that their improvements are superficial while their errors are fundamental.
  It can be inferred from this that Burke is upset with the National Assembly for attempting to form a free government without the necessary qualities.
  Therefore, based on this reasoning, the correct inference is that Burke is upset with the National Assembly’s decision to expand the size of the government.
  Hence, the answer is B: expand the size of the government.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that Burke is upset with the National Assembly's decision to expand the size of the government.
  The passage implies that Burke does not believe that the leaders of the National Assembly have the necessary qualities to form a free government, and that their improvements are superficial while their errors are fundamental.
  It is possible that Burke is upset with the National Assembly for seeking approval from the public instead of relying on their own judgment.
Action: Answer("C")

  Burke doubts the ability of those who take the lead in the National Assembly to form a free government.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Burke is critical of the National Assembly and does not think they are capable of forming a free government.
  Burke thinks that the leaders of the National Assembly are more interested in popularity and flattery than in effective legislative action.
  Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to overemphasize popularity and ignore the need for sober, careful governance.
  The National Assembly's tendency to indulge in more popular schemes and ignore moderate, thoughtful proposals may ultimately defeat the purpose of establishing a free government.
  Because of this, it can reasonably be inferred that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to seek the approval of the public.
  Therefore, the answer is C: seek the approval of the public.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:

  In 1789, the French formed a new governmental body known as the National Assembly, ushering in the tumultuous period of political and social change known as the French Revolution.
  According to Burke, forming a free government requires much thought, deep reflection, and a sagacious, powerful, and combining mind.
  Burke believes that the leaders of the National Assembly lack the skills and qualities necessary to form a free government and are more interested in bidding for popularity than in governing.
Thought: 
  Burke is critical of the leaders of the National Assembly for making themselves bidders at an auction of popularity instead of being statesmen and making difficult decisions that may not be popular.
  Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that Burke is upset with the National Assembly's decision to seek the approval of the public.
  The other choices are not mentioned as specific grievances of Burke.
  Therefore, the answer is C: seek the approval of the public.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct according to the passage.
  I have no criticism to make.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:

  He criticizes the National Assembly's leaders for bidding on popularity and making themselves flatterers instead of lawmakers.

Thought:
  Burke is critical of the National Assembly's leaders and their efforts to promote popularity over good governance.

  Therefore, it can be inferred that Burke is upset with the National Assembly's decision to expand the size of government, as this fits with his criticism of their efforts to promote popularity over good governance.
  The answer is B: expand the size of the government.
Criticism:
  The passage does not explicitly state that the National Assembly
  expanded the size of the government.
  Although Burke criticizes the National Assembly's efforts to promote popularity over good governance, it is not clear that he is specifically upset with their decision to expand the size of the government.
  However, Burke does imply that the National Assembly's efforts at reform are superficial and flawed, suggesting that he might have broader concerns with their governance.
  The answer of B: expand the size of the government is not conclusively supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar.
  In 1789, the French formed a new governmental body known as the National Assembly, ushering in the tumultuous period of political and social change known as the French Revolution.
  Burke believes that forming a government is easy and that giving freedom is even easier.
  Burke thinks that forming a free government which combines the elements of liberty and restraint alongside each other consistently is difficult and requires a powerful, sagacious, and combining mind.
  Burke criticizes the leaders of the National Assembly for wanting to be popular rather than enacting real change that could benefit the country.
Thought: 
  Burke does not explicitly state which particular decision of the National Assembly he is most upset about, but from the passage, we can infer that Burke is disappointed with the National Assembly for preferring popularity over the serious work of governing and for their failure to establish a consistent system of governance that balances liberty and restraint.
  None of the choices listed represent the decision that most clearly upsets Burke.
  Therefore, I must select the most likely answer which is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar.
  The French formed a new governmental body known as the National Assembly in 1789.
  Burke is critical of the National Assembly in relation to the French Revolution.
  Burke suggests that to form a free government requires a balancing of liberty and restraint.
Thought:
  Burke is critical of the leaders of the National Assembly.
  Burke suggests that the leaders are more concerned with popularity than constructing a free government.
  Burke suggests that the leaders are more concerned with producing new and popular schemes of liberty rather than implementing sober and limited schemes that could prove beneficial.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to seek popularity through promoting new and popular schemes of liberty instead of prudently limiting liberty to form a stable and free government.
  This is most closely aligned with choice C: seek the approval of the public.
Criticism:
  The passage does not provide clear evidence that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly seeking the approval of the public.
  The passage instead suggests that Burke is critical of the leaders pursuing new, but flawed schemes of liberty instead of implementing sober and limited schemes that could be more beneficial to forming a stable and free government.
  Therefore, the inference made in the thought section is a possible interpretation, but it cannot be confirmed from the passage with complete certainty.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:

  Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to expand the size of the government.
  The answer is B: expand the size of the government. 
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide any direct evidence that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to expand the size of the government.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")

  Burke believes the leaders of the National Assembly are more concerned with popularity than governing effectively.
Thought:

  He mentions that "to temper together these opposite elements of liberty and restraint" requires "much thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and combining mind".
  However, he does not see these qualities in the leaders of the National Assembly.
  This implies that the National Assembly made decisions without enough thought and reflection to form a free government.
  A, B, C, and D are all options that could be a part of a free government or a decision made by the National Assembly.

  He is upset that the leaders choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of popularity and become flatterers instead of legislators.
  They are the instruments, not the guides, of the people.
  He believes that moderate proposals for limited freedom will be outbid by more splendidly popular proposals, and leaders will be obliged to propagate doctrines and establish powers that will ultimately defeat any sober purpose.
  Most of the improvements of the National Assembly are superficial, and their errors are fundamental.
  Burke is critical of the leadership in the National Assembly for their conduct, crimes, and authority.
  He wishes his countrymen to recommend the example of the British constitution rather than take models from the National Assembly for the improvement of their own country.

  He suggests that alterations should be made to preserve, not to destroy, and they should be led by a great grievance.
  The ruling principles of our forefathers were politick caution, guarded circumspection, and moral rather than complexional timidity.
  They acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and fallibility of mankind.
  Burke suggests imitating their caution, adding to what they have left and standing on the firm ground of the British constitution.
  He recommends being satisfied to admire rather than attempt to follow in France's desperate flights.
  There is no specific mention of any decision related to limiting the king's power, expanding the size of the government, seeking the approval of the public, or ignoring the advice of former leaders.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: “I’ve come to inquire if you have work for me. That is, if.my performance pleased you before.” A deliberate prompt. I.didn’t want to be hired because of my need or his kindness. I.wanted my talent to be the reason he wanted me back..“Indeed” was all he offered..What now to fill the suspended moment? His new.projects. I asked. His eyebrows leapt up in symmetrical.curves..“A Byzantine chapel for the World’s Columbian.Exposition in Chicago next year. Four times bigger than the.Paris Exposition Universelle. It will be the greatest assembly.of artists since the fifteenth century.” He counted on his.fingers and then drummed them on the desk. “Only fifteen.months away. In 1893 the name of Louis Comfort Tiffany.will be on the lips of millions!” He stood up and swung open.his arms wide enough to embrace the whole world..I sensed his open palm somewhere in the air behind the.small of my back, ushering me to his massive, carved.mahogany exhibit table to see his sketches and watercolors..“Two round windows, The Infancy of Christ and Botticelli’s.Madonna and Child, will be set off by a dozen scenic side.windows.”.A huge undertaking. How richly fortunate. Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

  Therefore, the answer is A: showing a series of plans for stained glass windows he intends to construct.
Criticism:
  The answer is not B, presenting several finished stained glass windows and describing them in detail. The excerpt describes Tiffany showing the narrator sketches and watercolors of the project, not finished stained glass windows.
  The answer is not C, asking her opinion of the watercolor paintings he plans to exhibit in Chicago. The excerpt describes Tiffany telling the narrator about the Byzantine chapel project he plans to exhibit in Chicago, not about watercolor paintings.
  The answer is not D, displaying a chart that shows the placement of the artworks he plans to exhibit in Chicago. The excerpt describes Tiffany showing the narrator sketches and watercolors of the project, not a chart of artwork placement.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Tiffany is mentioned as an artist who undertook a huge project of creating Byzantine-style stained glass windows for an upcoming exhibition. 
  The narrator, who is seeking employment, is shown watercolor paintings depicting what the windows will look like.
  The passage mentions no other art forms or mediums aside from these stained glass windows.
Thought: 
  Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that Tiffany informs the narrator of his new projects by showing the narrator watercolor paintings of the stained glass windows he intends to construct. 
  Therefore, the answer is A: Showing a series of plans for stained glass windows he intends to construct.
Criticism: 
  No other possible medium of art is mentioned in this passage except stained glass windows, so it seems unlikely that Tiffany would be showing the narrator plans for any other type of artwork.
  It is also possible that B: presenting several finished stained glass windows and describing them in detail could be another possible answer.
  However, the passage specifically mentions watercolor paintings as the medium used to show the narrator what the windows will look like, rather than actual finished stained glass windows.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.
Question: According to Calma, the government’s failure tolink its expenditures on indigenous health initiativesto specific health outcomes is harmful because it
Choices:
  A: reinforces negative attitudes about the government’s financial fitness.
  B: undermines efforts to standardize practices across all departments of the government.
  C: perpetuates the pattern of government officials abusing their authority.
  D: allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Calma argues that focusing on "practical measures," such as government expenditures on Indigenous issues, fails to address the human rights issues facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. He suggests that using human rights as a framework will provide greater accountability and opportunities for Indigenous peoples to voice their concerns and legitimate claims to equal services and protection under the law. 
  The previous federal government emphasized their record expenditures on Indigenous issues, but failed to explain how these expenditures translated into specific health outcomes for Indigenous peoples. 

Thought:
  Calma argues that the government's emphasis on "record levels of expenditure" was flawed, as it failed to explain the specific health outcomes that these expenditures were meant to achieve. 
  This lack of explanation and focus on output rather than outcome allowed the government to avoid accountability for its policies. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies.

Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct. Calma suggests that the focus on expenditures without specific outcome targets allows the government to avoid accountability. 
  However, it is important to note that Calma does not say that linking expenditures to outcomes is harmful. He argues that failing to do so is harmful. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: The passage discusses a focus on practical measures versus a focus on human rights in addressing Indigenous peoples’ disadvantage and emphasizes the need for government accountability. Calma criticizes the previous federal government’s emphasis on the “record levels of expenditure” on Indigenous issues without explaining outcomes, accountability, or engagement with Indigenous peoples. He argues that a focus on human rights will support Indigenous peoples’ legitimate claims and government accountability. He praises the Statement of Intent signed by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous Affairs, and others, which commits to addressing Indigenous health inequality based on need, evidence, participation, and human rights. 
Thought: 
  According to Calma, the government’s failure to link its expenditures on indigenous health initiatives to specific health outcomes is harmful because it undermines accountability and “limits the accountability and responsibilities of government.” He also argues that the previous government’s emphasis on “record levels of expenditure” had no accountability, and therefore, lacked any accountability whatsoever. He emphasizes the need for human rights to support Indigenous peoples’ legitimate claims and government accountability. 
  Therefore, Calma would suggest that the government’s failure to link expenditures to outcomes allows the government to evade accountability for its policies. 
  The answer is D: allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to consider in this response. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The author argues that the government's emphasis on "record levels of expenditure" is flawed.
- The author questions why the government focuses on the size of the input, rather than the effectiveness of the output.
- The author argues that accountability is limited when outcomes are not tied to specific expenditures.
Thought:
- The focus on "record levels of expenditure" is problematic because it doesn't guarantee positive outcomes or hold the government accountable for achieving specific goals.
- Because there is no clear link between expenditures and outcomes, the government is able to avoid accountability for poor results.
- Therefore, the answer is D: allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies.
Criticism:
- Your response accurately reflects the author's arguments, so there is no criticism to make.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Calma is discussing government policies and programs related to Indigenous peoples.
  The focus on 'practical measures' has emphasized the record levels of expenditure.
  Calma questions the efficacy of this approach and argues that human rights are a better means for expressing legitimate claims and holding government accountable.
  Calma criticizes the government's failure to link expenditures on Indigenous health initiatives to specific health outcomes.
Thought: 
  Calma argues that the government's emphasis on 'practical measures' fails to hold the government accountable for its policies.
  Linking expenditures to specific outcomes would create accountability.
  Therefore, the government's failure to do so allows it to evade its responsibilities and is harmful.
  The answer is D: allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.
  The answer is supported by Calma's argument in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Calma believes that the emphasis on "record levels of expenditure" without linking the expenditures to specific health outcomes undermines accountability and responsibility of the government.
Thought: 
  According to Calma, the government’s failure to link its expenditures on indigenous health initiatives to specific health outcomes is harmful because it allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies.
  Therefore, the answer is D: allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism of this answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Calma argues that the government's emphasis on "record levels of expenditure" on Indigenous issues lacks accountability and never clearly identifies the intended outcomes of the spending. He notes that the practical approach to issues has allowed the government to devise policies without engaging with Indigenous peoples in a meaningful way. 
  A: Calma does not mention anything about negative attitudes toward government financial fitness.
  B: Calma does not mention anything about standardizing practices across departments.
  C: Calma does not mention anything about government officials abusing their authority.
  D: Calma suggests that the government's failure to link expenditures to outcomes limits accountability and evades responsibility for its policies. 
Thought: 
  Calma argues that the government's approach to expenditures lacks accountability because it does not identify specific outcomes. 
  He questions the emphasis on expenditure and highlights the need for accountability and engagement with Indigenous peoples.
  Therefore, the answer is D: allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies. 
Criticism: 
  You are correct that Calma argues that the government's approach lacks accountability and avoids answering for its policies.
  However, it is important to note that Calma does not suggest that the emphasis on expenditure is harmful in and of itself. Rather, the issue is that the government has not linked the expenditures to specific outcomes and has not engaged with Indigenous peoples in a meaningful way. 
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

Criticism: 
  You are correct that Miss Spivey came to Threestep to bring democracy and education to the poorest parts of the country.
  However, there is no mention in the passage that Miss Spivey talked with a woman at the WPA directly resulted in her arrival in Threestep. 
  It is only mentioned that two years after her coffee with Dewey, she expressed her desire to bring democracy and education to the poorest parts of the country to the WPA, who sent her to Threestep.

- She wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote, and forgotten corner of America.
Thought:
- The passage clearly mentions that it was the WPA who sent her to Threestep in Georgia.
- Miss Spivey's desire to bring democracy and education to remote parts of the USA suggests that she may have applied to organizations like the WPA to be sent to such places.
- There is no mention of her friendship with Janet Miller, attending college in New York City, or Miss Chandler's retirement being the direct cause of her ending up in Threestep.
- Therefore, the most likely answer is that she ended up in Threestep as a direct result of talking with a woman at the WPA.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Miss Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia to become a new schoolteacher.
  She had traveled extensively, and attended boarding schools and Barnard College in New York City.
  She was inspired to become a teacher after attending a lecture by John Dewey at Columbia University.
Thought: 
  Miss Spivey was hired by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to bring democracy and education to America's poorest area.
  She went to Threestep, Georgia as a result of her work with the WPA.
  She did not end up in Threestep due to her friendship with Janet Miller or Miss Chandler's retirement. Attending college in New York City inspired her to become a teacher, but was not the direct reason for her being in Threestep.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: talking with a woman at the WPA.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that Miss Spivey went to Threestep as a result of being hired by the WPA.
  However, the passage does not explicitly mention her talking to a woman at the WPA. Rather, it says that two years after attending the lecture by John Dewey, she expressed her desire to bring democracy and education to the poorest area of America to someone from the WPA, and was subsequently sent to Threestep. 
  So, a more accurate answer might be expressing her desire to the WPA, rather than talking with a woman at the WPA.

  She talked to someone about this idea, which led to her being sent to Threestep, Georgia as a new schoolteacher in August 1938.
  Among the choices given, the best one that closely matches the information given is C: talking with a woman at the WPA.
Criticism: 
  While the text does mention that Miss Spivey talked with someone about bringing democracy and education to remote and forgotten corners of America, there isn't any direct reference to that person being from the WPA.
  However, the passage does state that Miss Spivey had talked to someone from the WPA two years after she attended a lecture by John Dewey at Barnard College in New York City.
  Considering the timing and context, it can be inferred that it was through the connection with the WPA that Miss Spivey ended up teaching in Threestep, Georgia.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, a significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it
Choices:
  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap springs its trap closed only when the trapped insect touches two hairs within a period of 20 seconds that triggers the electric charge. 
  A: The passage doesn't talk about how flytrap identifies the species of its prey. 
  B: The flytrap needs a relatively high concentration of calcium to close that is induced by opening of calcium channels in the trap. In this way, the flytrap stores information in the electric charge of its leaf. 
  C: By springing its trap shut only after triggered by multiple hairs, flytrap ensures that it is not consuming too much of its energy and losing trap closure energy needlessly. 
  D: The passage mentions that a signal of two hair triggers the Venus flytrap into action. It ensures that the trap closes only when proper prey is crawling across its leaves.
Thought: 
  The Venus flytrap needs to be sure that the prey visiting is large enough so that the trap's closure is worth expending energy. 
  The flytrap requires only a relatively high concentration of calcium to close, which is induced by opening of calcium channels in the trap. 
  Thus, the flytrap stores information about the first trigger hair in the high calcium concentration and remembers the touch of the first hair in order to react upon the second that raises calcium concentration over the threshold to induce trap closure.
  Therefore, the significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect is large enough to be worth its time.
  The Venus flytrap uses its black hair to feel its prey, and it acts as triggers to shut the trap.
  If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against the next hair.
  Touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap induces calcium channels to open in the trap and causes a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.
  A single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach a high enough concentration of calcium to close the trap.
  A second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
Thought:
  The Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers (touching two hairs within 20 seconds) ensures that the calcium concentration is high enough to close the trap, conserves the plant's calcium reserves, and prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
  Therefore, the significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
  The answer is D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the passage that the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  While the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers may conserve the plant's calcium reserves in some way, the passage does not provide supporting evidence for this.
  While the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers may safeguard the plant's energy supply in some way, the passage does not provide supporting evidence for this.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap only springs into action when it is sure that the prey is worth the energy it will expend.
  The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to feel their prey. They act as triggers that spring the trap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap.
  If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
Thought:
  The Venus flytrap requires multiple triggers before closing its trap. This is advantageous because multiple triggers ensure that the insect is large enough to be worth the Venus flytrap's energy expenditure.
  A: There is no related information that suggests the Venus flytrap's multiple triggers enable it to identify the species of its prey. So, this choice is incorrect.
  B: The passage highlights one theory that demonstrates how Venus flytrap stores the memory of the touch in terms of calcium ions. However, the passage doesn't state that multiple triggers save calcium reserves for the plant.
  C: The choice "safeguards the plant's energy supply" seems relevant because it refers to the benefits of avoiding false or smaller prey. We can assume that the Venus flytrap would waste a significant amount of energy for a prey smaller than it could handle. Therefore, safeguarding the plant's energy supply seems like a promising option.
  D: It is mentioned that Venus flytrap only wants to spring with the prey worth its time. However, it doesn't mention how multiple triggers could prevent the trap from closing before capturing its prey. Therefore, choice D is incorrect.
  Based on this analysis, the answer is C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the visiting insect is large enough to be worth its time.
  The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the trap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap.
  If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against the next hair. 
Thought:
  The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed on a prey that is worth its effort.
  It needs at least two triggers to make sure it captures its prey; otherwise, it would waste energy on a smaller prey.
  This mechanism prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
  Therefore, the significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
  The answer is D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct and supported by the passage.
  There is no evidence in the passage to support choices A, B, or C.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: The Venus flytrap needs to know the size of its prey before it can catch it and it uses electric charge and calcium levels to store the memory of the prey encounter. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, so the Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The Venus flytrap stores the information on how many hairs it has touched in the electric charge of its leaf and requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close. 
Thought: The Venus flytrap requires multiple triggers to accumulate enough electric charge and calcium concentration to close, so this must prevent the plant from closing before capturing its prey. If the plant only required one trigger, it would close too often and waste energy on small prey. Since the calcium levels dissipate over time, multiple triggers ensure that the second touch occurs quickly enough for the plant to close and save its energy. 
The answer is D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Criticism: None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap requires multiple hair triggers to close its trap.
  Closing and reopening the trap requires a significant amount of energy for the Venus flytrap.
  The Venus flytrap stores short-term memory of the touch patterns of its prey.
Thought:
  The Venus flytrap wants to ensure that it captures a big enough prey since closing and reopening the trap requires a lot of energy.
  The trap requires two hairs to be touched in order to accumulate enough electric charge to close its trap.
  This means that a small insect won't spring the trap until a larger insect touches two hairs within a 20-second timeframe.
  Therefore, the Venus flytrap conservatively chooses its prey to conserve its energy supply.
  The answer is C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
Criticism:
  There is no mention of the Venus flytrap's ability to identify the species of its prey in the passage.
  In addition, the passage does not provide information on the conservation of the plant's calcium reserves.
  Although the Venus flytrap's multiple trigger requirement does prevent the premature closing of the trap, there is no mention of it in this context.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger to close.
  Closing the trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours.
  The Venus flytrap uses electric charge and calcium concentration to determine when to close the trap.
Thought:
  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger to close.
  This system helps conserve the plant's energy supply because it ensures that the trap only closes when it captures a large enough insect worth the energy cost.
  The conservation of energy by requiring multiple triggers is a significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's system.
  Therefore, the answer is C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap stores information when its hairs get touched.
  It needs to be touched in two hairs within about twenty seconds in order to react.
  The trigger hair causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
  A second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.
Thought: 
  The Venus flytrap needs a second hair to be stimulated to push the calcium level over the threshold and spring the trap.
  Therefore, the plant does not waste energy closing before capturing its prey.
  So, the significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is to prevent the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
  The answer is D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Criticism:
  The passage does not provide sufficient information to support the idea that the plant requires multiple triggers to conserve calcium reserves or safeguard its energy supply.
  Therefore, options B and C are not relevant alternatives to option D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap needs to ensure that its prey is large enough to be worth catching before closing.
  Closing the trap requires a lot of energy and reopening it takes a while.
  The hairs on the trap are used as triggers for the trap to close.
Thought: 
  The Venus flytrap needs to conserve its energy by not closing if the prey is not worth it. 
  Requiring the second hair trigger ensures that a large enough prey is present, saving energy for the plant.
  Therefore, a significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  The answer is C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to support the idea that requiring multiple triggers allows the flytrap to identify the species of its prey.
  While needing multiple triggers may help to conserve calcium, this advantage is not mentioned or discussed in the passage. 
  The Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers does help to prevent the plant from closing before capturing its prey, but this is not the main advantage discussed in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The Venus flytrap closes its trap only when it is sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.
  It only springs closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap, that too when 2 hairs are triggered within 20 seconds.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold. 
Thought: 
  The Venus flytrap needs two trigger hairs to be touched within 20 seconds to provoke it to close its trap.
  This requirement ensures that the plant doesn't close its trap before capturing the prey.
  Therefore, the significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
  The answer is D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.

Choices:
  A: regularly observe other members of their species using tools.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the acquisition of tool use in woodpecker finches compared to primates and New Caledonian crows. 
  It highlights the genetic component of tool use acquisition in woodpecker finches compared to social learning in primates. 
  The social system of primates is not described in detail, but previous studies on primates suggest social learning plays an important role in tool use.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that previous studies found that several forms of tool use in primates develop via social learning.
  It is implied that primates have a social system where young animals regularly observe other members of their species using tools, making it easier for them to acquire the knowledge.
  Therefore, the social system of primates allows for young animals to regularly observe other members of their species using tools.
  The answer is A: regularly observe other members of their species using tools.
Criticism: 
  There is no direct information in the passage about the social system of primates. 
  The passage only mentions that previous studies have found that several forms of tool use in primates develop via social learning.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their  parents. "They jumped up like popcorn," he said, 5 describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. "He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. "I asked 35 him how it went," Ken recalled, "and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' " Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the "aha" moment. "The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively," he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. "It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car," he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)
Question: What can reasonably be inferred about gliding animals from the passage?
Choices:
  A: Their young tend to hop along beside their parents instead of flying beside them.
  B: Their method of locomotion is similar to that of ground birds.
  C: They use the ground for feeding more often than for perching.
  D: They do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses ground birds and their method of locomotion, particularly the Chukar Partridge.
  The passage also discusses wing-assisted incline running (WAIR), where ground birds use flapping to aid in climbing slopes.
  
Thought:
  The question asks what can be inferred about gliding animals.
  The passage does not provide much information about gliding animals, except to mention that they do not perform a flapping stroke, which is a shortcoming of one of the theories discussed (the tree-down theory) regarding the origin of flapping flight stroke in birds.
  Nothing is mentioned about whether their young tend to hop along beside them, their method of locomotion being similar to ground birds, or their preference for feeding versus perching.
  
Criticism:
  The passage does not provide any clear inferences about gliding animals.
  None of the answer choices are supported by the passage.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a study on the Chukar Partridge and their method of locomotion called WAIR (wing-assisted incline running).
Thought:
  The passage does not provide information about whether gliding animals' young hop along or not.
  It also does not imply or explicitly state that gliding animals' method of locomotion is similar to that of ground birds.
  There is no information provided about whether gliding animals prefer the ground for feeding or perching.
  The passage states that gliding animals do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes but there is no indication about that in the passage. 
  Therefore, none of the above can be selected as a reasonably inferred statement from the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage compares the locomotion of ground birds and gliding animals.
  Gliding animals are not specifically defined, but they are implied to be animals that use gliding as a means of locomotion.
  There is no direct information provided about how young gliding animals move.
  The passage does not mention whether gliding animals use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes.
Thought: 
  The passage does not provide any specific information about how young gliding animals move, so it is not reasonable to make any inferences in this regard.
  The passage does compare the locomotion of ground birds and gliding animals, but it does not state that their methods of locomotion are similar.
  The passage mentions that ground birds prefer to rest on ledges or low branches but use the ground for feeding and traveling, implying that gliding animals may be similar in this regard, but this is not a direct statement.
  The passage does not say whether or not gliding animals use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes, so we cannot reasonably infer anything about this.
  None of the answer choices can be reasonably inferred from the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the behavior of ground birds, particularly the Chukar Partridge.
  The passage also discusses a discovery made by Ken Dial about how Chukar Partridges climb slopes, using a technique called WAIR, or wing-assisted incline running.
  Gliding animals are mentioned briefly in the passage, but not much information is given about them.
Thought: 
  There is not much information given in the passage about gliding animals.
  The passage only indicates that gliding animals do not perform the flapping flight stroke that birds do, which is used in the wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) technique.
  Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that gliding animals may not use the WAIR technique when climbing slopes, but no other conclusions can be made about their behavior.
  The answer is D: They do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is sound and supported by the information given in the passage.
  However, it should be noted that the passage does not provide any information about how gliding animals climb slopes in general, only that they do not use the wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) technique that birds do.
  Therefore, while it is reasonable to infer that gliding animals may not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes, it is not necessarily true that they do not use any other techniques.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses ground birds' method of locomotion known as wing-assisted incline running (WAIR).
  Ground birds prefer to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they are safe from predators.
  The passage does not provide any information about gliding animals.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the preference of ground birds to rest on elevated perches.
  There is no mention of gliding animals in the passage.
  Therefore, we cannot reasonably infer anything about gliding animals from the passage.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct; the passage does not provide any information about gliding animals, but "None of the Above" is not a valid answer choice. 
  Based on the available answer choices, the closest alternative is D, as the passage mentions how the birds use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes, but it does not give any information about gliding animals.
Action: Answer("D")

Thought:
  The passage does not provide any information about whether gliding animals' young tend to hop or fly beside them.
  The passage does not suggest that the method of locomotion of gliding animals is similar or dissimilar to that of ground birds.
  There is no information about how often gliding animals use the ground for perching or feeding.
  The passage does state that gliding animals do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes.
  Therefore, the answer is D: They do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes.
Criticism:
  There is no information in the passage to suggest that a comparison is being made between the methods of locomotion of gliding animals and ground birds.
  It is possible that other information about ground birds or gliding animals exists, but it is not present in this passage.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of a technique called "wing-assisted incline running" (WAIR) used by certain ground bird species to help them climb slopes. 
  WAIR is an energy-efficient alternative to flying that is used by both young birds learning to fly and adults. 
Thought: 
  The passage mentions gliding animals as a point of comparison to birds. 
  The passage notes that flying animals have evolved a flapping stroke that gliding animals do not exhibit. 
  Based on that comparison and the lack of additional information about gliding animals, it can be inferred that gliding animals do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes - the opposite of what birds do with WAIR.
  Therefore, the answer is D: They do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes.
Criticism: 
  None.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis," says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. "Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth," Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. "We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment," Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 "standard of care treatment." That's going to take five years and $\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.
Question: In the last sentence of Passage 2, the author uses the phrase "five years and $\pounds 500$ million" primarily to
Choices:
  A: emphasize the scale of the effort needed to make teixobactin available for consumer use.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author refers to the timeline and cost associated with clinical trials for teixobactin in the last sentence of Passage 2.
  A: Choice A does not capture the author's intent, as the sentence is not focused on the effort needed to make the drug available for consumer use. 
  B: The author does not criticize government funding in the given sentence.
  C: Choice C is somewhat accurate, as the author is emphasizing the amount of time and money required throughout the development cycle. However, it misses the sense of urgency conveyed by the sentence.
  D: The sentence is focused on the clinical trial timeline and cost, not a comparison of teixobactin to other drugs.
Thought: 
  The author indicates that clinical trials to bring the drug to market will take five years and $\pounds 500$ million.
  This amount of time and money is significant and suggests that bringing a drug to market involves a lengthy and expensive process.
  It is possible that the sentence is meant to communicate the need for greater investment in drug development to combat the growing health crisis.
  Therefore, the main purpose of the sentence is to highlight the lengthy and costly nature of the drug development process and, by implication, the need for action to staunch the spread of antibiotic resistance.
  The answer is not A, B, or D; the answer is C.
Criticism: 
  The author is not emphasizing the amount of time and money spent so far on researching teixobactin.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

  The passage does not suggest that the narrator is Miss Spivey's predecessor, so answer choice B is not supported by the text.
  While it is true that the narrator is not identified by name or personal details, the use of "we" and other community-based language implies that the narrator is not entirely anonymous.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: “I’ve come to inquire if you have work for me. That is, if.my performance pleased you before.” A deliberate prompt. I.didn’t want to be hired because of my need or his kindness. I.wanted my talent to be the reason he wanted me back..“Indeed” was all he offered..What now to fill the suspended moment? His new.projects. I asked. His eyebrows leapt up in symmetrical.curves..“A Byzantine chapel for the World’s Columbian.Exposition in Chicago next year. Four times bigger than the.Paris Exposition Universelle. It will be the greatest assembly.of artists since the fifteenth century.” He counted on his.fingers and then drummed them on the desk. “Only fifteen.months away. In 1893 the name of Louis Comfort Tiffany.will be on the lips of millions!” He stood up and swung open.his arms wide enough to embrace the whole world..I sensed his open palm somewhere in the air behind the.small of my back, ushering me to his massive, carved.mahogany exhibit table to see his sketches and watercolors..“Two round windows, The Infancy of Christ and Botticelli’s.Madonna and Child, will be set off by a dozen scenic side.windows.”.A huge undertaking. How richly fortunate. Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

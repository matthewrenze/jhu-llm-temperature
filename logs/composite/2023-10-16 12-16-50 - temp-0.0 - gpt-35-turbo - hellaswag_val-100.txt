Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to wear leggings in summer [title] Choose a breathable material like cotton to avoid overheating. [step] You want something with good ventilation for hotter days, and your best options will be a cotton or lycra blend, or even bamboo. [substeps] Some legging styles also have mesh stripes or bands, which can increase breathability as well.
Choices:
  A: These have a sporty look that will go well with oversized t-shirts and jerseys. [title] Try leggings on before buying them to make sure they look and feel good.
  B: Look for leggings that are without padding or at least cling to your legs. These are thin cotton pieces with small straps and attached sleeves, around the top of your legs and neck.
  C: [title] Choose solid neutrals to avoid color schemes. [step] Since these garments are designed and created to create patterns on the basis of contrasting colors, you want to avoid anything off of these colors.
  D: It's easiest to make sure that your fabric is breathable when wearing leggings in the summer, though, particularly in colder months. If you're just getting started, you probably won't need to invest in underwear.

Topic: Health
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to fix bent glasses [title] Grab a pair of plastic-tipped pliers. [step] Pliers will allow you to make micro-adjustments to the bent frames more safely than trying to force them into shape by hand. If possible, equip yourself with a pair that has a soft plastic coating on the tips.
Choices:
  A: Ordinary metal pliers may scratch or even snap thin wire frames. [substeps] If you don't have a suitable set of pliers on hand, a plastic hand clamp or pair of forceps will also get the job done.
  B: Otherwise, you can simply hold the pair of pliers in your hand and allow them to slip out of place. [title] Lift the lens with the tips of the pliers.
  C: [substeps] Metal cases are among the cheapest materials available, but they'll make this much more difficult. If you can't find plastic-tip pliers, your dentist will probably opt for glass cases instead.
  D: Soft plastic can be better than hard plastic. [substeps] The purpose behind the plastic is to enhance the appearance of the lenses, while making them easier to clean and replace.

Topic: Family Life
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need Â½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

  A: Talks about using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat. This is not related to the topic of the text.
  B: Suggests giving the child lots of milk throughout the day. This is not a good idea as too much milk can lead to anemia and iron deficiency in children.
  C: Suggests starting the day with one cup of milk. This is not a good idea as it is too much milk for a child to consume at once.
  D: Suggests starting with a small amount of milk, such as 1 to 3 oz, and gradually increasing the amount. This is a good suggestion as it allows the child to get used to the taste of milk without overwhelming them.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Family Life
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

  B: These remedies will help the child to avoid bites during the day and can reduce stress and anxiety levels while also raising their immune system. Find a wide range of medications available to help children with insect bites.
  C: These will be covered in the following steps. [title] Keep your child from scratching the bite, regardless of what insect bit him.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make a homemade ear cleaner [title] Get a small bottle. [step] You can either get an ear dropper bottle or a small (1 oz) brown bottle with an eye-dropper cap. [title] Fill the bottle with your chosen oil.
Choices:
  A: [step] Make sure that the bottle is small enough to hold all of the oil you'll be adding to it. [substeps] Oil from your choice of product may not soften your ear canal to the point where it won't fit over a toothbrush.
  B: [step] Use either mineral oil or olive oil. [substeps] Oil-based cleaners have the advantage of lubricating the ear canal.
  C: [step] Add distilled water to make the bottle easier to clean. Test the ear cleaner on a small, hidden area of your ear while it is still in the bottle.
  D: [step] You can use any type of oil, but don't add more than 10 drops if you want to replicate this scent. Keep dilufying the oil between 5-10 drops.

  B: The woman on the back of the camel starts knee to knee with the woman on the front. This is possible, but it is not clear what this means or why it is significant.
  C: The woman on the back of the camel waves at the camera. This is possible, but it is not clear why the camera is there or why the woman is waving.
  D: The woman on the back of the camel is running and with other people walking alongside it. This is unlikely as it is not safe to run with a camel and it is not clear why other people would be walking alongside it.
Thought: 
  The text does not provide enough information to determine the most likely completion.
  However, option B seems to be the most plausible as it describes a possible position of the woman on the back of the camel.
  Therefore, the answer is B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
Criticism: 
  While option B is possible, it is not clear what it means or why it is significant.
  It is also possible that none of the options are correct as the text does not provide enough information to determine the most likely completion.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to get oil out of hair [title] Shampoo your hair several times. [step] Use your regular shampoo to wash your hair in the shower. Really work the shampoo into your scalp using your fingers and rinse it out thoroughly with lukewarm water.
Choices:
  A: Rinse your hair as soon as possible after it is done, as prolonged washing can hurt the scalp. [title] Dry your hair as soon as possible.
  B: Have a good conditioner available on hand for long-term use. [substeps] Because oil can build up if you're not getting it regular, don't rinse it out very often, as this may clog or unbalance the hair follicles.
  C: Repeat the process one or two more times, as needed. [substeps] After you finish shampooing, add some conditioner to your hair and let it sit for 5 minutes before rinsing out.
  D: [substeps] You can use a hairdryer, a microfiber cloth, or a shower cap to gently detangle your hair to avoid spreading the oil or holding your hair in. [title] Squeeze a dime-sized amount of shampoo from a bottle.

Topic: Health
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to dry shoes quickly [title] Look at the construction of your shoes. [step] If they are synthetic or cotton, without hard or gelled soles, they can go into the dryer. Leather, gel-core athletic shoes, clogs and gore-tex should not go into the washer or dryer.
Choices:
  A: [title] Wash them first if they are caked with mud. [step] Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle.
  B: Shoes could be permanently damaged if dirt and debris are not removed with the help of microbes. Typical finishes of shoes should be white and reasonably soft.
  C: Of course, if they aren't synthetic, place them into the washing machine with the proper temperature. [substeps] Avoid using steel wool or other aggressively abrasive laers, as these can damage the rubber soles of a properly-made pair of shoes.
  D: Synthetic synthetic shoes do not absorb as well as polyester/plastic soft shoes, so in most cases you will need to replace them later. [substeps] Steamers and other lubricants are best, but any dry pair of shoes should be fine.

  C: [substeps] People with a warm complexion typically have warmer undertones than people with a neutral complexion. Choose a foundation that's somewhere between a warm and neutral shade.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to ripen a cantaloupe [title] Check the cantaloupe once the color changes. [step] Never harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green, since these melons are undoubtedly unripe. Once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, though, it is probably ripe.
Choices:
  A: [title] Place the cantaloupe in a container for ripeness. [step] Placing your cantaloupe on its side will produce ripeness.
  B: [substeps] If the cantaloupe has very dark spots, blackheads, or dark spots, it is ripe. If the spots appear darker, or have a splotchy look to them, it may be ripe.
  C: If the cantaloupe turns a light brown after you slice it, or stays green, it is ripe. [title] Place the cantaloupe on the cutting board with its skin facing down.
  D: [substeps] Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?

Choices:
  A: [substeps] Baggy and ill-fitting clothes will only make you look frumpy, and will do nothing to lengthen your legs. Avoid buying clothes that don't fit you perfectly.
  B: This is a fine location for height-conscious people to look, but avoid gaudy clothes that show interest in the female genitalia. [title] Accentuate the things that help you look.
  C: [substeps] For instance, if you weigh 13, you should accentuate your body's inner thighs by wearing items high enough so that your thighs are above your hips. If you don't particularly want to highlight your curves, pick short skirts or dresses that fall nicely and that hug your waist without drapes.
  D: Your wardrobe should also remind you that a bit of your figure is confined in all different ways and only when clothing accentuates or constricts these curves you can look the part. [substeps] Wear vertical stripes to make your legs look shorter.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make your hair grow faster [title] Include protein in your daily diet. [step] Your hair and nails are primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.
  B: Lycra is the natural hair that grows throughout a person's legs, shoulders, and calves. You need to eat at least four servings of lycra per day, and have from three meals.
  C: The number and duration of all three processes in a daily cycle will vary based on your personal styling style. Consult your hair stylist as they can help you with specific on-the-job textures and techniques.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to talk to a child about a bad grade [title] Explain the problem to the child how they would understand it. [step] Tell them that without good grades, many people won't be interested in hiring them for a job when they grow up. [title] Avoid negativity.
Choices:
  A: [step] This doesn't help children with adhd find employment. Make sure your concern regarding a problem goes beyond what adults would actually say.
  B: [step] It's fine to be upset with your child, but calling him/her a " failure " or commenting on his/her " stupidity " will only cause a decrease in self esteem. Degrading remarks can hurt more than you know.
  C: [step] Studies show that most people actually want to work, even before they reach 3 years old. [title] Tell the child why they need a job.
  D: [step] Since preschool age children cannot achieve success in school and some teachers are no longer motivated to work with them, they may feel incomplete or powerless to make their students feel successful. Stay calm and upbeat that the child is competent and capable of making good grades.

Topic: Home and Garden
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to edge a lawn without an edger [title] Make a straight line with 2 wooden sticks and string. [step] Set 2 wooden sticks into the ground 1-2 inches (2.5-5.1 cm) from the edge of your flower bed or walkway. Then, tie a piece of string to each stick to form a straight line that will become the edge.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Any stand-apart string will suffice. It can consist of any age and material, but white, black, or even red is the standard.
  B: There should not be any loops or gaps between the sticks. [substeps] Tie the string to the stick to secure it to the height you desire in your garden bed as the bow points outwards.
  C: Make sure to leave at least 3 feet (1.9 m) of spare string running between your 3 sticks. [substeps] Make sure to use equal lengths of long string and cut it so that the entire surface of the flower bed is packed with string.
  D: [substeps] Setting the line before you start edging the lawn will keep your work neater. You can also try to edge by eye, but it may look sloppy.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to look good on a rainy day [title] Wear a fitted trench coat with a hood. [step] The trench coat is a classic piece that works well for nearly any woman's wardrobe. A coat with a hood will provide you with added protection from the rain, but even a trench coat without a hood can work if you plan on carrying an umbrella.
Choices:
  A: Consider a standard beige trench, a sophisticated burgundy trench, or a vibrant red trench, depending on your personality. [title] Look for a coat that flatters your figure.
  B: [substeps] Check to see if your trench coat has shoulder straps. Invest in a trench coat that measures as closely to your body as possible for optimal coverage of your body.
  C: [substeps] Look for a trench coat with a rounded brim to help give you some extra height. Trench coats that are higher on your body will make it easier to cross a puddle, and will be less prone to splashing.
  D: [substeps] A trench coat has a tailored neckline with small , 2-person sleeves running from the collar to the curve of the shoulder. This is one of the most classic attire for women who prefer not to wear coats with hoods.

  C: The completion suggests that the singer continues to play the piano running out to the end and stopping for a while to talk to the audience. This is unlikely as the text only mentions the singer standing on the piano, not playing it.

  A: This will help you provide a good, continuous record of his up-to-the-minute habits. [substeps] You might record breakfast, lunch, and snack times.
  B: [substeps] For instance, if your child wakes up about an hour before naptime, have them break out his ready-made lunch so they can have enough time to eat before naptime. If your child usually wakes up hours before naptime, try a more gradual recording of their wake time.
  C: Note what time your child goes to bed, what time they wake up, and any naps they take during the day. You should try to identify any patterns in your child's sleep, and if noise, hunger, light or too many naps during the day are causing the early wake time.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to apply eyeliner to small round eyes [title] Apply a light-colored eyeliner to your waterline. [step] Use a white or nude colored eyeliner for the best results. Light colors will open and brighten your eyes so they look bigger.
Choices:
  A: You will need to apply the eyeliner in this color to begin with. Then, move on to your waterline and then your eyelid.
  B: Focus on your waterline when working with eyeliner. [substeps] For more precise eye work, get a small eye brush (such as a toothpick, eyebrow brush, or electric wand), and water that goes with eyeliner on smaller, streaky areas.
  C: [substeps] Apply a softer line of eyeliner on your waterline for a more natural look. Avoid applying eyeliner all the way across your waterline if you have close-set eyes, as this will make them appear closer together.
  D: [substeps] Only use white eyeliner for brown eyes. Otherwise, the eyeliner won't pop as much and will sink into your eyebrows and make your eyes look round.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

  B: [substeps] Wear a haircut you think suits your style. A dash haircut gives you a medium cut that will leave little to no split ends in your hair.
  C: When you're not shampooing your hair, spend some time conditioning and conditioning it, giving it time to dry out before buying new ones. This is especially important if you're considering a dyed hair color that you're worried someone might dye your hair.

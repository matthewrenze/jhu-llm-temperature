Topic: Health
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to fix bent glasses [title] Grab a pair of plastic-tipped pliers. [step] Pliers will allow you to make micro-adjustments to the bent frames more safely than trying to force them into shape by hand. If possible, equip yourself with a pair that has a soft plastic coating on the tips.
Choices:
  A: Ordinary metal pliers may scratch or even snap thin wire frames. [substeps] If you don't have a suitable set of pliers on hand, a plastic hand clamp or pair of forceps will also get the job done.
  B: Otherwise, you can simply hold the pair of pliers in your hand and allow them to slip out of place. [title] Lift the lens with the tips of the pliers.
  C: [substeps] Metal cases are among the cheapest materials available, but they'll make this much more difficult. If you can't find plastic-tip pliers, your dentist will probably opt for glass cases instead.
  D: Soft plastic can be better than hard plastic. [substeps] The purpose behind the plastic is to enhance the appearance of the lenses, while making them easier to clean and replace.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
Knowledge:
- The text is about fixing bent glasses.
- The text suggests using plastic-tipped pliers to make micro-adjustments to the bent frames.

Topic: Family Life
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Family Life
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite for warmth, cooking, and/or recreation.
  Campfires are typically built in a fire pit or ring.
  Fires can be started using various methods such as matches, lighters, or fire starters.
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The fire is not described as growing in size or rapidly spreading across the ground.
  The text suggests that people are watching the fire, which implies that it is dancing or flickering in some way.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Criticism: 
  There is no definitive answer to this question, as the text is open to interpretation.
  It is possible that the fire is not dancing or flickering, and that people are simply sitting around it.
  Additionally, the text does not provide enough information to determine whether the fire was lit from the inside up or put out behind an iron grill.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite, used for warmth, cooking, and/or recreation.
  A campfire is typically started with small pieces of dry wood and kindling.
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Criticism: 
  There are other possible completions to the text, such as describing the sound of the fire crackling or the smell of the smoke.
  However, given the context of the text, A is the most likely completion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire that is lit outdoors, usually in a campsite or wilderness area.
  Campfires are often used for cooking, warmth, and socializing.
Thought: 
  The sentence "A campfire burns brightly in the night" suggests that the fire is already burning.
  The phrase "the fire" implies that we are continuing to describe the fire that was previously mentioned.
  The phrase "burns brightly" suggests that the fire is already large and bright.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence is A: "dances and people watch it flame."
Criticism: 
  There are other possible ways to complete the sentence, such as "crackles and pops as the wood burns" or "casts flickering shadows on the trees."
  However, these options are less likely because they do not directly follow from the previous sentence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite, used for warmth, cooking, and/or recreation.
  A: This option describes the fire as dancing and people watching it flame, which is a common activity around a campfire.
  B: This option describes the fire slowly growing in size, which is possible as more wood is added to the fire.
  C: This option describes the process of lighting a fire from the inside up and putting it out behind an iron grill, which is not a common method for starting or extinguishing a campfire.
  D: This option describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not a desirable outcome for a campfire.
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The most likely completion to the text would describe a common activity or characteristic of a campfire.
  Option A describes people watching the fire and the fire dancing, which is a common activity around a campfire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Criticism: 
  Option B is also a possible completion to the text, as a campfire can slowly grow in size as more wood is added to it.
  However, the text specifically mentions the fire burning brightly, which suggests that it is already a significant size.
  Option C is not a common method for starting or extinguishing a campfire, so it is unlikely to be the correct completion to the text.
  Option D describes a dangerous situation where the fire is spreading rapidly, which is not a desirable outcome for a campfire.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite for warmth, cooking, and/or entertainment.
  A campfire is usually started with small pieces of dry wood and kindling.
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The fire is not being started, so options C and D can be eliminated.
  The text suggests that people are watching the fire, so option A is a possibility.
  However, the text does not provide any information about the fire's movement, so option B is also a possibility.
  Option B seems more likely because the fire is described as "burning brightly", which suggests that it is already a decent size.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:

  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite for warmth, cooking, and/or entertainment.
  A campfire is usually started with small pieces of dry wood and kindling.
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is an action that describes what the fire is doing or what people are doing around the fire.
  Option A: "dances and people watch it flame" is a likely completion because it describes the movement of the fire and the people's attention to it.
  Option B: "slowly grows in size" is less likely because the text already states that the fire is burning brightly, which implies that it is already a decent size.
  Option C: "is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill" is less likely because it describes a process for starting and extinguishing a fire, but the text already implies that the fire is already burning.
  Option D: "rapidly spreads across the ground" is unlikely because it describes a dangerous situation that is not consistent with the safe and controlled environment of a campfire.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: "dances and people watch it flame."
Action: Answer("A")

  The phrase "dances and people watch it flame" is the most likely completion, as it suggests that the fire is flickering and moving, and that people are gathered around it watching it.
  The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite, used for warmth, cooking, and/or recreation.
  A campfire is typically built in a fire pit or ring, and should be surrounded by a clear area free of flammable materials.

  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The fire is not described as growing in size or rapidly spreading across the ground, which would be dangerous and undesirable.
  The fire is not described as being lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill, which is a specific method of building and extinguishing a fire.

Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make your hair grow faster [title] Include protein in your daily diet. [step] Your hair and nails are primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Each phasema has a 5 to 10 percent impact on hair quality. In general, the more protein you consume, the faster your hair growth will begin.
  B: [substeps] Protein is important, both for building and maintaining hair's growth-and making it thinner by increasing the amount of protein your body burns. This will help support your hair's growth.
  C: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.
  D: They are not differentiated from hair that is entirely corn. [substeps] High protein foods should be added to your diet to ensure optimal hair-growth.

Topic: Health
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to dry shoes quickly [title] Look at the construction of your shoes. [step] If they are synthetic or cotton, without hard or gelled soles, they can go into the dryer. Leather, gel-core athletic shoes, clogs and gore-tex should not go into the washer or dryer.
Choices:
  A: [title] Wash them first if they are caked with mud. [step] Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle.
  B: Shoes could be permanently damaged if dirt and debris are not removed with the help of microbes. Typical finishes of shoes should be white and reasonably soft.
  C: Of course, if they aren't synthetic, place them into the washing machine with the proper temperature. [substeps] Avoid using steel wool or other aggressively abrasive laers, as these can damage the rubber soles of a properly-made pair of shoes.
  D: Synthetic synthetic shoes do not absorb as well as polyester/plastic soft shoes, so in most cases you will need to replace them later. [substeps] Steamers and other lubricants are best, but any dry pair of shoes should be fine.

If you don't particularly want to highlight your curves, pick short skirts or dresses that fall nicely and that hug your waist without drapes.

  Option B talks about using the length of a long broom to measure rosemary, but this seems like an unusual method and is not commonly used.
  Option C talks about the length of rosemary plants, but it does not provide information on how to identify the plant.
  Option D talks about using a measuring tape to measure rosemary, but it is not clear where to start the measurement from.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to thin hair [title] Purchase a pair of thinning shears. [step] Thinning shears are often used by stylists in salons, and look like scissors with a thick, serrated edge. They are designed to cut about 15% of the hair, resulting in hair that still holds its shape and style but has less volume and density.
Choices:
  A: Use the scissors to clip back specific length of the hair at the roots when needed. [substeps] Thinning shears can be purchased at most hardware stores.
  B: [substeps] You can buy the shears from beauty supply stores or the hair care section of most department stores. [title] Begin working with clean, dry hair.
  C: They tend to be thicker than straight-ended scissors, but should also be less dense with their blades. [title] Buy extra-long (thicker) growth shears to grow stubble.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

  A: You will need to apply the eyeliner in this color to begin with. Then, move on to your waterline and then your eyelid.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

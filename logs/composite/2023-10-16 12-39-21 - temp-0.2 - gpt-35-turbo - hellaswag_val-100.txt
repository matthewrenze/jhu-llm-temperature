Choices:
  A: These have a sporty look that will go well with oversized t-shirts and jerseys. [title] Try leggings on before buying them to make sure they look and feel good.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to fix bent glasses [title] Grab a pair of plastic-tipped pliers. [step] Pliers will allow you to make micro-adjustments to the bent frames more safely than trying to force them into shape by hand. If possible, equip yourself with a pair that has a soft plastic coating on the tips.
Choices:
  A: Ordinary metal pliers may scratch or even snap thin wire frames. [substeps] If you don't have a suitable set of pliers on hand, a plastic hand clamp or pair of forceps will also get the job done.
  B: Otherwise, you can simply hold the pair of pliers in your hand and allow them to slip out of place. [title] Lift the lens with the tips of the pliers.
  C: [substeps] Metal cases are among the cheapest materials available, but they'll make this much more difficult. If you can't find plastic-tip pliers, your dentist will probably opt for glass cases instead.

[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

  The completion that talks about massaging the lemon juice into the face with gentle circular motions is a possible step in making a lemon face cleanser.
  The completion that talks about straining out the seeds and pulp if using fresh lemon juice and adding plain yogurt is also a possible step in making a lemon face cleanser.
  The completion that talks about blending the lemon with water does not match the previous text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is either B or C.
Criticism: 
  Both B and C are possible completions, but it is difficult to determine which one is more likely without additional information about the recipe.
Action: Answer("B or C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The text is about making a lemon face cleanser.
  A: The completion involves adding lemon essential oil and honey to the bowl. This is not mentioned in the initial text.
  B: The completion involves massaging the lemon juice into the face with gentle circular motions. This is a possible step in the process, but it is not the most likely completion to the text.
  C: The completion involves straining out the seeds and pulp from the fresh lemon juice and adding plain yogurt. This is a possible step in the process, but it is not the most likely completion to the text.
  D: The completion involves blending the lemon with water. This is not mentioned in the initial text.
Thought: 
  The initial text provides one step for making the lemon face cleanser, which is to pour 1 teaspoon of lemon juice into a small bowl.
  The text also mentions that fresh lemon juice is best, but bottled may also work.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text would be another step that involves adding another ingredient to the bowl.
  Option A involves adding lemon essential oil and honey, which is not mentioned in the initial text.
  Option B involves massaging the lemon juice into the face, which is a possible step, but it is not the most likely completion to the text.
  Option C involves straining out the seeds and pulp from the fresh lemon juice and adding plain yogurt, which is a possible step, but it is not the most likely completion to the text.
  Option D involves blending the lemon with water, which is not mentioned in the initial text.
  Therefore, none of the options are the most likely completion to the text.
  The most likely completion would be to add another step that involves mixing the lemon juice with another ingredient, such as water or baking soda.
  However, since "None of the Above" is not an option, the most likely answer would be option C.
Criticism: 
  Option C is a possible completion to the text, but it is not the most likely completion.
  The text mentions that fresh lemon juice is best, but bottled may also work. It does not mention anything about straining out the seeds and pulp from the fresh lemon juice.
  Therefore, the correct answer cannot be determined from the given options.

Criticism: 
  You are correct that the text provides the first step of the process, which is to pour 1 teaspoon of lemon juice into a small bowl.
  However, the most likely completion is not necessarily B.
  The text does not provide enough information to determine the next step in the process.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Family Life
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

Topic: Starting a campfire
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
A camp fire burns brightly in the night. the fire
Choices:
  A: dances and people watch it flame.
  B: slowly grows in size.
  C: is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill.
  D: rapidly spreads across the ground.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite for warmth, cooking, and enjoyment.
  Campfires are usually built in a fire pit or ring to prevent the fire from spreading.
  A: The fire dancing and people watching it flame is a possible activity around a campfire, but it does not complete the sentence.
  B: As the fire burns, it consumes more fuel and grows in size, so this is a possible completion to the sentence.
  C: Lighting a fire from the inside up and putting it out behind an iron grill is a specific method of building and extinguishing a fire, but it does not complete the sentence.
  D: A campfire that rapidly spreads across the ground is dangerous and not desirable, so this is an unlikely completion to the sentence.
Thought: 
  The sentence describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The fire is already burning, so it is unlikely that it slowly grows in size.
  The sentence does not mention a specific method of building or extinguishing the fire, so C is unlikely.
  A campfire that rapidly spreads across the ground is dangerous and not desirable, so D is unlikely.
  A fire that dances and people watch it flame is a possible activity around a campfire, so A is possible.
  However, the most likely completion to the sentence is B, as the fire consumes more fuel and grows in size as it burns.
  Therefore, the answer is B: slowly grows in size.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is sound and your conclusion is correct.
  However, it is possible that the sentence is describing a fire that is already at its maximum size and brightness, so B is not the only possible completion.
  A is also a possible completion, as it describes a common activity around a campfire.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite, used for warmth, cooking, and/or recreation.
  A campfire is typically started with kindling and/or fire starters, and then built up with larger pieces of wood.
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The fire is not being started or built up, so options B and C are unlikely.
  Option D is also unlikely, as a rapidly spreading fire would be dangerous and not desirable in a campsite.
  Option A is the most likely completion, as it describes the fire dancing and people watching it flame, which is a common activity around a campfire.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite for warmth, cooking, and enjoyment.
  Campfires are typically started with kindling and small pieces of wood, which are gradually built up into a larger fire.
Thought: 
  The sentence "A campfire burns brightly in the night" suggests that the fire is already burning.
  The phrase "the fire" implies that the sentence is continuing to describe the fire that has already been introduced.
  The phrase "burns brightly" suggests that the fire is already well-established and producing a lot of light.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence is A: "dances and people watch it flame."
Criticism: 
  There are other possible ways to complete the sentence, such as "crackles and pops as the wood burns" or "casts flickering shadows on the trees."
  However, these options are less likely than A, given that the sentence already establishes that the fire is burning brightly and in the night.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire that is lit outdoors, usually in a campsite or wilderness area.
  Campfires are typically used for warmth, cooking, and socializing.
Thought: 
  The sentence "A campfire burns brightly in the night" suggests that the fire is already burning.

  Option A suggests that the fire is dancing and people are watching it, which is a common activity around a campfire.
  Option B suggests that the fire is slowly growing in size, which is possible but not necessarily the most likely completion.
  Option C suggests that the fire is being lit in a specific way and put out behind an iron grill, which is not relevant to the sentence.
  Option D suggests that the fire is rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not only unlikely but also dangerous.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite, usually in the evening or at night.
  Campfires are typically used for warmth, cooking, and socializing.
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The fire is already burning, so it is unlikely that it will slowly grow in size or rapidly spread across the ground.
  The text mentions people watching the fire, so it is likely that the fire is dancing.
  The text does not mention an iron grill or lighting the fire from the inside up, so options C and D are unlikely.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is sound.
  However, it is possible that the fire could slowly grow in size if more wood is added to it.
  Also, while it is likely that people are watching the fire, it is not necessarily true that the fire is dancing.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite for warmth, cooking, and/or recreation.
  Campfires are typically contained within a fire pit or ring.
  Fires should be properly extinguished before leaving the campsite.
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence should describe what is happening with the fire.
  Option A suggests that the fire is dancing and people are watching it flame, which is a likely scenario.
  Option B suggests that the fire is slowly growing in size, which is possible but not necessarily the most likely scenario.
  Option C suggests that the fire is being lit from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill, which does not make sense given the context of the text.
  Option D suggests that the fire is rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not a likely scenario for a contained campfire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  A campfire is a fire that is lit outdoors, usually in a designated fire pit or ring.
  Campfires are often used for warmth, cooking, and socializing.
Thought:
  The sentence "A campfire burns brightly in the night" implies that the fire is already burning.

  Option A describes the fire "dancing" and people watching it, which is a common activity around a campfire.
  Option B suggests that the fire is growing in size, which is possible but not necessarily the most likely completion.
  Option C describes a specific method of lighting and extinguishing a fire, but it is not clear from the sentence that this is what is happening.
  Option D suggests that the fire is spreading uncontrollably, which is not consistent with the idea of a campfire in a designated fire pit or ring.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire that is lit outdoors, usually in a fire pit or on the ground.

  C: This option describes the process of lighting a fire from the inside up and putting it out behind an iron grill, which is not a common practice for starting a campfire.
  D: This option describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is dangerous and not a desirable outcome for a campfire.
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The most likely completion to the text would describe a common activity or characteristic of a campfire.
  Option A describes people watching the fire flame, which is a common activity around a campfire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.
  Option A is the most likely completion to the text as it describes a common activity around a campfire.
  However, it is possible that other options could also be correct depending on the context of the situation.

Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make your hair grow faster [title] Include protein in your daily diet. [step] Your hair and nails are primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Each phasema has a 5 to 10 percent impact on hair quality. In general, the more protein you consume, the faster your hair growth will begin.
  B: [substeps] Protein is important, both for building and maintaining hair's growth-and making it thinner by increasing the amount of protein your body burns. This will help support your hair's growth.
  C: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.
  D: They are not differentiated from hair that is entirely corn. [substeps] High protein foods should be added to your diet to ensure optimal hair-growth.

  A: This is the correct completion of the text. After lifting the weight to the shoulders, the lifter jumps their feet apart and lifts the weight above their head to complete the clean and jerk.
  B: This is not a likely completion of the text, as the lifter has just lifted the weight and is not likely to drop it down and relax.
  C: This is not a likely completion of the text, as the lifter has not yet completed the lift and is not likely to slam the weight against the wall.
  D: This is not a likely completion of the text, as the lifter has not yet completed the lift and is not likely to sit back up without attempting to lift the weight again.
Thought:

Choices:
  A: looks at her phone while the two women hold the camel down.
  B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
  C: waves at the camera.
  D: is running and with other people walking alongside it.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  When riding a camel, it is common for one person to sit in front and one person to sit in back.
Thought:
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  The woman on the back of the camel is not described as doing anything.
  Therefore, it is impossible to determine what she is doing.
  None of the options seem to be the most likely completion to the text.
  However, option C seems to be the most neutral and plausible option.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: waves at the camera.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  A: The woman on the back of the camel looks at her phone while the two women hold the camel down. This is unlikely as it is not safe to use a phone while riding a camel and it is unclear why the two women would need to hold the camel down.
  B: The woman on the back starts knee to knee with the woman on the front. This is a possible completion to the text as it describes a common way to sit on a small camel.
  C: The woman on the back waves at the camera. This is possible, but it is not clear if there is a camera present or why the woman would be waving.
  D: The woman on the back is running and with other people walking alongside it. This is unlikely as it is not safe to run with a camel and it is unclear why other people would be walking alongside it.
Thought: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  The most likely completion to the text is that the woman on the back starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
  This is a common way to sit on a small camel and makes the most sense given the context.
  Therefore, the answer is B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  However, it is possible that the woman on the back could be doing something else, such as holding onto the woman in front or adjusting her position.
  So, while B is the most likely completion, it is not the only possible one.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  When riding a camel, the person on the front is usually called the "lead" or "front" rider, while the person on the back is called the "rear" or "back" rider.
Thought:
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  It mentions the woman on the back of the camel, but does not mention what she is doing.
  The options are all possibilities, but without more information, it is impossible to know for sure which one is the most likely.
  However, option A seems unlikely because it suggests that the two women are holding the camel down, which is not necessary when riding a camel.
  Option B is a possibility, but there is no indication in the text that the women are sitting knee to knee.
  Option C is also a possibility, but there is no mention of a camera in the text.
  Option D seems unlikely because it suggests that the camel is running, which would be difficult to do with two people on its back.
  Therefore, based on the information given, it is impossible to determine the most likely completion to the text.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  A: The woman on the back of the camel looks at her phone while the two women hold the camel down. This is unlikely as it is not safe to use a phone while riding a camel and it is unclear why the two women would need to hold the camel down.
  B: The woman on the back starts knee to knee with the woman on the front. This is possible, but it is not clear what this means or why it is significant.
  C: The woman on the back waves at the camera. This is possible and could be a common pose for a photo while riding a camel.
  D: The woman on the back is running and with other people walking alongside it. This is unlikely as it is not safe to run while riding a camel and it is unclear why other people would be walking alongside the camel.
Thought: 
  The most likely completion to the text is C: The woman on the back waves at the camera. This is a common pose for a photo while riding a camel and is a safe and reasonable action to take.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  A: The woman on the back of the camel is looking at her phone while the two women hold the camel down. This is unlikely because it is dangerous to use a phone while riding a camel and it is unclear why the two women would need to hold the camel down.
  B: The woman on the back of the camel starts knee to knee with the woman on the front. This is possible, but it is unclear what this means or why it is significant.
  C: The woman on the back of the camel waves at the camera. This is possible, but it is unclear why the camera is there or who is taking the picture.
  D: The woman on the back of the camel is running and with other people walking alongside it. This is unlikely because it is dangerous to run with a camel and it is unclear why other people would be walking alongside it.
Thought: 
  The text does not provide enough information to determine the most likely completion.
  However, option B seems to be the most plausible because it describes a possible position of the woman on the back of the camel.
  Option C is also possible, but it is unclear why the camera is there or who is taking the picture.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the text does not provide enough information to determine the most likely completion.
  However, option B is not necessarily the most plausible because it is unclear what it means or why it is significant.
  Option C is also possible, but it is unclear why the camera is there or who is taking the picture.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.

  B: The woman on the back starts knee to knee with the woman on the front. This is possible, but it is not clear what this means or why it is significant.
  C: The woman on the back waves at the camera. This is possible and could be a common pose for a photo on a camel ride.
  D: The woman on the back is running and with other people walking alongside it. This is unlikely because it is not safe to run while riding a camel and it is not clear why other people would be walking alongside the camel.
Thought: 
  The most likely completion to the text is C: The woman on the back waves at the camera. This is a common pose for a photo on a camel ride and is a safe and easy action to take while riding a camel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  When riding a camel, the person in the front is usually seated with their legs crossed and the person in the back sits behind them with their legs on either side of the camel.
Thought:
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  The woman on the back of the camel is mentioned, but there is no mention of her moving or doing anything.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the woman on the back of the camel is simply sitting there.
  The only answer choice that describes the woman on the back of the camel doing nothing is A: looks at her phone while the two women hold the camel down.
Criticism:
  Answer A is not a very likely completion to the text because it suggests that the two women are struggling to hold the camel down, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Answer C is a more likely completion because it is common for people to wave at cameras when taking pictures.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  A: The woman on the back of the camel is looking at her phone while the two women hold the camel down. This is unlikely as it is dangerous to use a phone while riding a camel and it is not mentioned that the camel is out of control.
  B: The woman on the back of the camel starts knee to knee with the woman on the front. This is unlikely as it is not clear what is meant by "starts knee to knee" and it is not mentioned that the women are changing positions.
  C: The woman on the back of the camel waves at the camera. This is possible as it is a common pose for taking pictures while riding a camel.
  D: The woman on the back of the camel is running and with other people walking alongside it. This is unlikely as it is not mentioned that the camel is running and it is not clear why the woman would be running alongside the camel.
Thought: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  It is not mentioned that the camel is out of control or that the women are changing positions.
  The most likely completion to the text is that the woman on the back of the camel is waving at the camera.
  Therefore, the answer is C: waves at the camera.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is sound and the answer is likely correct.
  However, it is possible that the woman on the back of the camel is doing something else that is not mentioned in the text.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  A: The woman on the back of the camel looks at her phone while the two women hold the camel down. This option does not make sense as it is unlikely that the women would need to hold the camel down.
  B: The woman on the back of the camel starts knee to knee with the woman on the front. This option does not make sense as the text does not mention any movement.
  C: The woman on the back of the camel waves at the camera. This option is possible as it is common for people to take pictures while riding a camel.
  D: The woman on the back of the camel is running and with other people walking alongside it. This option does not make sense as it is unlikely that the camel would be running with people walking alongside it.
Thought: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  It is common for people to take pictures while riding a camel.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the woman on the back of the camel waves at the camera.
  The answer is C: waves at the camera.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of a camera in the text, so it is possible that the woman on the back of the camel is doing something else.
  However, waving at the camera is a common activity while riding a camel, so it is still the most likely completion to the text.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  A: The woman on the back of the camel is looking at her phone while the two women hold the camel down is unlikely because it is not safe to use a phone while riding a camel, and it is not clear why the two women would need to hold the camel down.
  B: The woman on the back starting knee to knee with the woman on the front is unlikely because it is not clear what this means and it is not a common practice in camel riding.
  C: The woman on the back waving at the camera is possible because it is common to take pictures while riding a camel.
  D: The woman on the back running with other people walking alongside it is unlikely because it is not clear why the woman would be running and it is not common to run while riding a camel.
Thought: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  It is common to take pictures while riding a camel.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the woman on the back of the camel is waving at the camera.
  The answer is C: waves at the camera.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is sound and the answer is plausible.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

  The objective of the game is to score by shooting the ball into the opponent's goal.
Thought: 
  A player from the blue team aggressively chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal.
  This means that the player is attempting to score a goal for his team.
  The next sentence starts with "his team member", which suggests that the player is passing the ball to his teammate.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the player passes to another teammate who then scores a goal.
  The correct answer is A: passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of a "sumo" in the text, so answer A is not correct.

  Option C seems like a possible completion, and it is likely that the player would try to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
  Option D seems like an unlikely completion, as it is not common to call a player a loser for failing to score a goal.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct. 
  However, it is important to note that the player may also try to pass the ball to a teammate or take a shot on goal, rather than just trying to keep the ball away from the opponent.
Action: Answer("C")

[header] How to dry shoes quickly [title] Look at the construction of your shoes. [step] If they are synthetic or cotton, without hard or gelled soles, they can go into the dryer. Leather, gel-core athletic shoes, clogs and gore-tex should not go into the washer or dryer.
Choices:
  A: [title] Wash them first if they are caked with mud. [step] Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle.
  B: Shoes could be permanently damaged if dirt and debris are not removed with the help of microbes. Typical finishes of shoes should be white and reasonably soft.
  C: Of course, if they aren't synthetic, place them into the washing machine with the proper temperature. [substeps] Avoid using steel wool or other aggressively abrasive laers, as these can damage the rubber soles of a properly-made pair of shoes.
  D: Synthetic synthetic shoes do not absorb as well as polyester/plastic soft shoes, so in most cases you will need to replace them later. [substeps] Steamers and other lubricants are best, but any dry pair of shoes should be fine.

  The text mentions that the man picks up weight and lifts it over his head.
Thought: 
  The text mentions that the man "sometimes he" and then there are two options:
  A: "lifts so far he is dragged to the ground." This is unlikely because it is not a safe or effective way to lift weights.
  B: "put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it." This is also unlikely because it does not describe the man actually lifting the weight.
  C: "lowers his arms and his hands up." This is not a logical completion to the sentence and does not make sense in the context of weightlifting.
  D: "fails, other times he is successful." This is the most likely completion to the sentence because it is common for weightlifters to fail at lifting a weight and then succeed on a subsequent attempt.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct and the answer is likely D.
Action: Answer("D")

  The text says that the man picks up weight and lifts it over his head.
  The text does not provide any information that suggests that the man is dragged to the ground or that he puts the weight down to raise it above his head.

  The text describes a man training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The man picks up weight and lifts it over his head several times.
Thought: 
  The text describes the man lifting weight over his head several times.
  The text also says "sometimes he" which implies that the next sentence will describe something that happens occasionally.
  Option A, "lifts so far he is dragged to the ground," seems unlikely because it is not safe to lift weights beyond one's capacity.
  Option B, "put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it," is possible, but it does not describe the man's lifting technique or ability.
  Option C, "lowers his arms and his hands up," does not make sense because it is not a complete sentence and it is unclear what it means.
  Option D, "fails, other times he is successful," seems like the most likely completion because weightlifting is a difficult sport and even experienced athletes may not succeed every time they attempt a lift.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Criticism: 
  None.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to ripen a cantaloupe [title] Check the cantaloupe once the color changes. [step] Never harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green, since these melons are undoubtedly unripe. Once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, though, it is probably ripe.
Choices:
  A: [title] Place the cantaloupe in a container for ripeness. [step] Placing your cantaloupe on its side will produce ripeness.
  B: [substeps] If the cantaloupe has very dark spots, blackheads, or dark spots, it is ripe. If the spots appear darker, or have a splotchy look to them, it may be ripe.
  C: If the cantaloupe turns a light brown after you slice it, or stays green, it is ripe. [title] Place the cantaloupe on the cutting board with its skin facing down.
  D: [substeps] Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.

  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: Baggy and ill-fitting clothes will only make you look frumpy, and will do nothing to lengthen your legs. Avoid buying clothes that don't fit you perfectly.
Criticism: 
  Option A is actually the opposite of what the text is trying to achieve. The text is about how to make short legs look longer, and Option A talks about how baggy and ill-fitting clothes will make you look frumpy, which is not helpful advice for achieving the goal of the text.
  Option C talks about accentuating your body's inner thighs and picking short skirts or dresses that fall nicely and hug your waist without drapes, which is helpful advice for achieving the goal of the text.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: For instance, if you weigh 13, you should accentuate your body's inner thighs by wearing items high enough so that your thighs are above your hips. If you don't particularly want to highlight your curves, pick short skirts or dresses that fall nicely and that hug your waist without drapes.

  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is to provide enough shelter for the barn owls to nest in.
  Option B talks about stumbling into something on the way home from a trip to town, which is not relevant to the topic.
  Option C talks about putting a bird box on a pole, which is a good idea, but it is not related to the shed.
  Option D talks about purchasing an owl-repellent, which is the opposite of what the text is trying to achieve.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Provide enough shelter.
Criticism:
  The text suggests that clearing out the shed and leaving the door open is enough to attract barn owls.
  However, it does not mention anything about providing shelter.
  So, the best answer may be C: Put a bird box on a pole, about 2 and a half metres off the ground, as this would provide a suitable nesting site for the barn owls.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:

  The first step is to clear out the shed and leave the door open.
  This suggests that barn owls are likely to nest in the shed if given the opportunity.
  The substeps suggest leaving the door open to allow the barn owls to enter.
  The most likely completion to the text would be advice on how to provide additional shelter or nesting opportunities for the barn owls.
  Choice C suggests putting up a bird box on a pole, which is a common method for attracting barn owls.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: "Put a bird box on a pole, about 2 and a half metres off the ground."
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
  Choice C is the most likely completion to the text, as it provides advice on how to provide additional shelter or nesting opportunities for the barn owls.

  Choice D is not a real solution, as there is no such thing as an owl-repellent.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:

  A: Wooden wading poles are not a good way to keep barn owls out of a shed, as they can fly over them.
  B: Providing shelter is important for barn owls, but stumbling into something on the way home from a trip to town is not a reliable way to attract them.
  C: Putting up a bird box on a pole is a good way to attract barn owls, as they will use it as a nesting site.
  D: Owl-repellents are not a good way to keep barn owls away from a shed, as they are not effective and may harm the birds.

Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. Putting up a bird box on a pole is a good way to attract barn owls. 
  However, it is worth noting that leaving the shed open is not the only way to attract barn owls, and there may be other factors to consider, such as the location of the shed and the availability of prey.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

Thought: 
  The text describes a singer standing on a piano on a large stage while a drummer plays in the background.
  The completion that suggests the singer continues playing the piano is unlikely because the text does not mention the singer playing the piano.
  The completion that suggests the drummer begins to play a tune is also unlikely because the text mentions the drummer already playing in the background.
  The completion that suggests the singer continues singing followed by jumping off the piano and dancing around the stage is possible, but it is not the most likely completion because the text only mentions the singer talking into the mic.
  The completion that suggests the singer continues to play the piano running out to the end and stopping for a while to talk to the audience is also possible, but it is not the most likely completion because the text only mentions the singer talking into the mic and not playing the piano.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is None of the Above.

  Option A, B, and C do not mention anything related to the drummer.
  Option D mentions a close up of the piano, but it does not mention anything related to the singer or the drummer.
  Therefore, none of the options seem to be the most likely completion to the text.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct that none of the options seem to be the most likely completion to the text.
  However, it is possible that the text is incomplete or missing information that would make one of the options a likely completion.
  So, the most likely answer would be the option that is the closest to the text, which would be A: continues playing the piano and ends by shaking hands and walking off stage.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

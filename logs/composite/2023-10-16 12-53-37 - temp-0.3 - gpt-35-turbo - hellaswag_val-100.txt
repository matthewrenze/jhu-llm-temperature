Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to fix bent glasses [title] Grab a pair of plastic-tipped pliers. [step] Pliers will allow you to make micro-adjustments to the bent frames more safely than trying to force them into shape by hand. If possible, equip yourself with a pair that has a soft plastic coating on the tips.
Choices:
  A: Ordinary metal pliers may scratch or even snap thin wire frames. [substeps] If you don't have a suitable set of pliers on hand, a plastic hand clamp or pair of forceps will also get the job done.
  B: Otherwise, you can simply hold the pair of pliers in your hand and allow them to slip out of place. [title] Lift the lens with the tips of the pliers.
  C: [substeps] Metal cases are among the cheapest materials available, but they'll make this much more difficult. If you can't find plastic-tip pliers, your dentist will probably opt for glass cases instead.
  D: Soft plastic can be better than hard plastic. [substeps] The purpose behind the plastic is to enhance the appearance of the lenses, while making them easier to clean and replace.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Family Life
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

  Option C describes a process for starting and putting out a fire, which is not relevant to the text.

  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.
  Option A is the most likely completion to the text, as it describes a common activity around a campfire.
  There is no indication in the text that the fire is being started or put out, so options C and D are not relevant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  A campfire is a fire that is lit outdoors, typically in a designated fire pit or ring.
  A campfire is usually used for cooking, warmth, and socializing.
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The fire is already burning, so it is unlikely that it will slowly grow in size or rapidly spread across the ground.
  The text suggests that people are watching the fire, so it is likely that the fire is dancing and flickering.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite for warmth, cooking, and/or recreation.
  Campfires are typically built in a fire pit or ring.
  Campfires should be monitored and properly extinguished before leaving the site.
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  It does not mention anything about the fire growing in size or spreading rapidly across the ground.
  It also does not mention an iron grill or lighting the fire from the inside up.
  The most likely completion to the text is that the fire is providing entertainment for people who are watching it.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Criticism:
  The answer is subjective and could vary depending on the context of the campfire.
  While it is common for people to watch a campfire and enjoy the flames, it is also possible that the fire is being used for cooking or warmth and people are not necessarily watching it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:

  A campfire is usually used for cooking, warmth, and light.
  A campfire should be built in a safe location and properly extinguished when finished.
Thought: 
  The sentence says "A campfire burns brightly in the night." This implies that the fire is already burning.
  The next sentence says "the fire" which implies that the sentence will describe what the fire is doing.
  "dances and people watch it flame" is a likely completion because it describes the fire in a way that makes it seem alive and entertaining.
  "slowly grows in size" is a possible completion, but it doesn't fit as well because it doesn't describe the fire's movement or behavior.
  "is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill" is not a likely completion because it describes how to light and extinguish a fire, not what the fire is currently doing.
  "rapidly spreads across the ground" is not a likely completion because it describes a dangerous and uncontrolled fire, not a campfire.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Criticism: 
  The completion "slowly grows in size" is also a possible answer because it describes the fire's behavior and movement.
  However, "dances and people watch it flame" is a more likely completion because it is more descriptive and fits better with the imagery of a campfire.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  A campfire is a fire that is lit outdoors, usually in a campsite or wilderness area.
  Campfires are often used for warmth, cooking, and socializing.
Thought:
  The sentence "A campfire burns brightly in the night" suggests that the fire is already burning.
  The phrase "the fire" implies that we are continuing to describe the fire that was previously mentioned.
  Option A seems like a likely completion, as it describes the fire "dancing" and people watching it.
  Option B is less likely, as it suggests the fire is still growing in size, which may not be the case if it is already burning brightly.
  Option C seems less likely, as it describes a specific method for lighting and putting out the fire that may not be relevant to the context.
  Option D is unlikely, as it suggests the fire is spreading uncontrollably, which is not a desirable outcome for a campfire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is A: "dances and people watch it flame."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite for warmth, cooking, and/or entertainment.
  Campfires are typically contained within a fire pit or ring.
Thought: 
  The sentence "A campfire burns brightly in the night" suggests that the fire is already burning.
  The phrase "the fire" implies that we are continuing to talk about the same fire that was just mentioned.
  The options "slowly grows in size" and "rapidly spreads across the ground" both suggest that the fire is changing in size or location, but there is no indication in the text that this is happening.
  The option "is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill" suggests a specific method for starting and extinguishing a fire, but there is no indication in the text that this is how the fire was started or will be put out.
  The option "dances and people watch it flame" suggests that people are present and enjoying the fire, which is consistent with the idea of a campfire being used for entertainment.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: "dances and people watch it flame."
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct based on the information given in the text.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  A campfire is a fire that is lit outdoors for warmth, cooking, and/or recreation.
  It is important to safely start, maintain, and extinguish a campfire.
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The fire is already burning, so it is not likely that it will slowly grow in size or rapidly spread across the ground.
  It is also not likely that the fire will be lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill, as this is not a common method for starting or extinguishing a campfire.
  Option A, "dances and people watch it flame," is the most likely completion to the text, as it describes a common activity around a campfire.
Criticism:
  Option A is a bit subjective, as there could be many different ways to describe how a campfire looks or behaves.
  However, it is still the most likely completion to the text based on common activities and behaviors around a campfire.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite for warmth, cooking, and aesthetic purposes.
  A campfire is usually built in a fire pit or a fire ring.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make your hair grow faster [title] Include protein in your daily diet. [step] Your hair and nails are primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Each phasema has a 5 to 10 percent impact on hair quality. In general, the more protein you consume, the faster your hair growth will begin.
  B: [substeps] Protein is important, both for building and maintaining hair's growth-and making it thinner by increasing the amount of protein your body burns. This will help support your hair's growth.
  C: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.

  A: The woman on the back of the camel is looking at her phone while the two women hold the camel down is unlikely to be the completion of the text as it does not make sense.
  B: The completion of the text could be that the woman on the back of the camel starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
  C: The completion of the text could be that the woman on the back of the camel waves at the camera.
  D: The completion of the text is unlikely to be that the woman on the back of the camel is running and with other people walking alongside it as it does not make sense.
Thought:
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  The woman on the back of the camel is mentioned.
  The most likely completion of the text is that the woman on the back of the camel is doing something.
  Option B and C both seem plausible.
  However, option C seems more likely as it is a common pose for people taking photos on a camel ride.
  Therefore, the most likely completion of the text is that the woman on the back of the camel waves at the camera.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  When riding a camel, the person on the back usually sits behind the person on the front.
Thought:
  The text says that two women are sitting on a small camel.
  It also says that the woman on the back of the camel is being described next.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  A: The woman on the back of the camel looks at her phone while the two women hold the camel down. This is unlikely because the two women are already sitting on the camel, so they would not need to hold it down.

  C: This option is possible, but there is no mention of a camera in the text.
  D: This option is unlikely, as it describes a different scenario than the one presented in the text.
Thought: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  The woman on the back of the camel is mentioned specifically.
  The most likely completion to the text would describe something related to the woman on the back of the camel.
  Option A is unlikely, as holding the camel down while it's already in motion is dangerous.
  Option B is the most likely completion, as it describes the typical seating arrangement on a camel.

Thought: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  The woman on the back of the camel is mentioned.
  The completion should describe what the woman on the back of the camel is doing.
  The most likely completion is that the woman on the back of the camel starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
  Therefore, the answer is B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct. 
  However, it is possible that the woman on the back of the camel could be doing something else, such as holding onto the woman in front of her or looking around at the scenery.
  So, while B is the most likely completion, it is not the only possible answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: [title] Next, gently brush out tangles, starting at the ends and slowly working your way to the roots. [title] Section your hair into two parts-the top half and the bottom half. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:

[header] How to get oil out of hair [title] Shampoo your hair several times. [step] Use your regular shampoo to wash your hair in the shower. Really work the shampoo into your scalp using your fingers and rinse it out thoroughly with lukewarm water.
Choices:
  A: Rinse your hair as soon as possible after it is done, as prolonged washing can hurt the scalp. [title] Dry your hair as soon as possible.

  C: Repeat the process one or two more times, as needed. [substeps] After you finish shampooing, add some conditioner to your hair and let it sit for 5 minutes before rinsing out.
  D: [substeps] You can use a hairdryer, a microfiber cloth, or a shower cap to gently detangle your hair to avoid spreading the oil or holding your hair in. [title] Squeeze a dime-sized amount of shampoo from a bottle.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

Thought: 
  The text describes a player from the blue team chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The most likely completion to the text would be an action that follows this description.
  Option A is unlikely because it mentions a sumo, which is not relevant to the text.
  Option B is unlikely because it mentions the player spinning and missing the goal, but the text does not mention this.
  Option C is likely because it mentions the player trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is relevant to the text.
  Option D is unlikely because it mentions the player being called a loser, which is not relevant to the text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  In lacrosse, players use a stick to pass and shoot a ball into the opponent's goal.

Thought:
  The blue team player is trying to hit a goal, so he is likely to shoot the ball towards the opponent's goal.
  The text mentions "his team member", so it is likely that the blue team player passes the ball to his teammate.
  Option A describes a scenario where the teammate scores a goal and the blue team celebrates, which seems like a likely completion to the text.
  Option B describes the blue team player missing the goal, which is possible but not the most likely completion based on the aggressive chase described in the text.
  Option C describes the blue team player trying to keep the ball away from the opponent, which is not a likely completion based on the blue team player's aggressive chase towards the goal.
  Option D describes the blue team player being called a loser, which is not a likely completion based on the information given in the text.

  A player from the blue team is chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to score a goal.
Thought: 
  The player from the blue team is trying to score a goal, so it is unlikely that he would pass the ball to another teammate.
  The player is described as "aggressively" chasing the ball, so it is unlikely that he would spin quickly to evade the ball.
  The player is also described as trying to hit a goal, so it is unlikely that he would try to keep the ball away from the opponent team player.
  It is also unlikely that the player would be called a loser for failing to score a goal.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the player shoots the ball towards the goal, but the outcome is unknown.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is sound, and it is true that the outcome of the player's attempt to score a goal is unknown.
  However, the question asks for the "most likely" completion to the text, and "None of the Above" is not a likely completion.
  Based on the information given, it is more likely that the player will either score a goal or miss the goal.

Thought: 
  A player from the blue team aggressively chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal.
  The sentence suggests that the blue team player is attempting to score a goal.
  The next sentence starts with "his team member", which implies that the blue team player passes the ball to his teammate.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the blue team player passes to another teammate.
  Option A suggests that the teammate scores a goal, which is a possible outcome.
  Option B suggests that the blue team player misses the goal, which is also a possible outcome.
  Option C suggests that the blue team player tries to keep the ball away from the opponent team player, which is not a likely outcome based on the information provided.
  Option D suggests that the blue team player fails and is called a loser, which is not a likely or appropriate outcome.
  Therefore, the best completion to the text is A: passes to another teammate, the teammate makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.

  The text mentions that the player is trying to hit a goal, which means he is attempting to score.
  The next sentence starts with "his team member", which suggests that the player is passing the ball to his teammate.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the player passes to another teammate who then scores a goal.
  The answer is A: passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
Criticism: 
  The completion "spins quickly to evade the ball and missed the goal by two feet" is possible, but it does not fit with the fact that the player is aggressively chasing the ball and trying to hit a goal.
  The completion "tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player" is also possible, but it does not fit with the fact that the player is trying to score.
  The completion "fails the first time and he is called a loser" is not likely, as it is not common to insult players who fail to score.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  In lacrosse, players use their sticks to carry, pass, and shoot the ball into the opponent's goal.
  The blue team player is chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
Thought: 
  The blue team player is trying to hit a goal, so he is likely shooting the ball.
  The text mentions "his team member", so it is likely that the blue team player passes the ball to his teammate.
  The blue team player is described as "aggressively" chasing the ball, so it is likely that he is successful in getting the ball.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the blue team player passes to another teammate, who then makes a goal and the blue team celebrates.
  The answer is A: passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of a "sumo" in the text, so answer A is not correct.
  Answer C is also a possibility, as the blue team player could be trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")

Thought: 
  A player from the blue team aggressively chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal.
  The sentence ends with "his team member."
  It is likely that the player's team member will be involved in the next action.
  Option A is incorrect because it mentions a "sumo," which is not a term used in lacrosse.
  Option B is incorrect because it suggests that the player missed the goal.
  Option D is incorrect because it suggests that the player is called a loser, which is not a likely or appropriate response in lacrosse.
  Option C is the most likely completion because it suggests that the player tries to keep the ball away from the opponent team player, which is a common strategy in lacrosse.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Lacrosse is a team sport played with a ball and a long-handled stick called a crosse.

Thought: 
  A player from the blue team aggressively chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal. 
  The sentence ends with "his team member".
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence is that "his team member" does something related to the ball and the goal.
  Option A talks about a sumo making a goal, which is not related to the sentence.
  Option B talks about the player missing the goal, which is possible but not necessarily related to the team member mentioned in the sentence.
  Option C talks about the player trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is possible but not necessarily related to the team member mentioned in the sentence.
  Option D talks about the player failing and being called a loser, which is not related to the team member mentioned in the sentence.

  The objective of the game is to score goals by shooting the ball into the opponent's net.
Thought: 
  A player from the blue team aggressively chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal.
  This means the player is attempting to shoot the ball into the opponent's net.
  The next sentence starts with "his team member", which implies that the player is going to pass the ball to a teammate.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the player passes to another teammate who then scores a goal.
  The correct answer is A: passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of a "sumo" in the text, so it is unlikely that this is the correct answer.
  Additionally, the option D is inappropriate and does not make sense in the context of the text.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to dry shoes quickly [title] Look at the construction of your shoes. [step] If they are synthetic or cotton, without hard or gelled soles, they can go into the dryer. Leather, gel-core athletic shoes, clogs and gore-tex should not go into the washer or dryer.
Choices:
  A: [title] Wash them first if they are caked with mud. [step] Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle.
  B: Shoes could be permanently damaged if dirt and debris are not removed with the help of microbes. Typical finishes of shoes should be white and reasonably soft.
  C: Of course, if they aren't synthetic, place them into the washing machine with the proper temperature. [substeps] Avoid using steel wool or other aggressively abrasive laers, as these can damage the rubber soles of a properly-made pair of shoes.
  D: Synthetic synthetic shoes do not absorb as well as polyester/plastic soft shoes, so in most cases you will need to replace them later. [substeps] Steamers and other lubricants are best, but any dry pair of shoes should be fine.

  Option C is also unlikely because it suggests that the man lowers his arms and hands up after lifting the weight, which is not a common technique in weightlifting.
  Option D is the most likely because it suggests that the man sometimes fails to lift the weight over his head, while other times he is successful, which is a common experience in weightlifting.

  This is because the bodybuilder is likely taking a break to recover and then will continue lifting.
  Option B does not make sense because there is no mention of a beam and it is unclear what is being dropped near the floor.
  Option C is unlikely because it suggests that the bodybuilder will continue lifting until he drops the weight and the other bodybuilders fall, which is not a safe or realistic scenario.
  Option D is also unlikely because it suggests that the bodybuilder will run towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down, which is not a safe or realistic scenario.
  Therefore, the answer is A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
Action: Answer("A")

  The exercise involves lifting a barbell from the ground to the shoulders and then lifting it above the head.
Thought: 
  The text describes a weightlifter lifting a barbell up to his chest.
  The next logical step in the exercise is to lift the barbell above his head.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is "then lifts it over his head."
  The answer is A: then lifts it over his head.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.
  However, it is important to note that the clean and jerk involves two distinct movements: the clean and the jerk.
  The lifter first lifts the barbell to his shoulders in the clean, and then lifts it above his head in the jerk.
  So, a more accurate completion to the text would be "then performs the jerk to lift it above his head."
  The answer is C: lifts it above his head.
Action: Answer("C")

Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct.
  However, the text does not explicitly mention the clean and jerk exercise.
  It is possible that the weightlifter is performing a different exercise.
  Therefore, the answer is the most likely completion based on the information given.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The clean and jerk is a weightlifting movement that consists of two main parts: the clean and the jerk.
  During the clean, the lifter lifts the barbell from the floor to the shoulders.
  During the jerk, the lifter lifts the barbell from the shoulders to above the head.
Thought: 
  The text describes a weightlifter lifting a barbell up to his chest.
  This is likely the clean portion of the clean and jerk.

  The answer is C: lifts it above his head.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the text that the lifter is performing the clean and jerk.

  Option A mentions mixing ingredients in a bowl, which is a common step in baking cookies.
  Option B mentions mixing flour and water together, but does not mention any other ingredients or cookies specifically.
  Option C mentions pouring into a pot with a pan and putting in ice, which does not seem related to baking cookies.
  Option D mentions putting mashed potatoes in the oven, which is not related to baking cookies.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: then mix ingredients in a bowl.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The text describes a scene in a kitchen with ingredients on a counter and two boys present.
Thought: 
  Based on the information given, the most likely completion to the text is that the boys then mix the ingredients in a bowl.
  This is the most logical next step in the baking process, given the presence of ingredients on the counter and the fact that the boys are in the kitchen.

  A, B, C, and D are all possible completions to the text, but only one is the most likely.
Thought: 
  The text mentions that the woman is still holding the white paper as she talks.
  This suggests that the woman is the focus of the scene and the flashing words are likely related to her or what she is saying.
  Option A suggests that the flashing words appear as the woman speaks again, which makes sense.
  Option B suggests that the flashing words appear after the woman is talking and continue to the end, which is also possible but less likely.
  Option C does not make sense in the context of the text.
  Option D is completely unrelated to the text and does not make sense.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: flashing words appear on the screen announcing it is time to start as the woman speaks again.
Criticism: 
  There is no clear indication in the text that it is time to start anything, so option A may not be the most likely completion.
  Option B is also possible and could make sense if the flashing words are related to what the woman is saying.
  However, options C and D do not make sense in the context of the text.

Topic: Personal Care and Style
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

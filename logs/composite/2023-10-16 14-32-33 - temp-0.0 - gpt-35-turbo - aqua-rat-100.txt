### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  75% of the employees take a winter vacation.
  40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.
Thought:
  Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
  75 employees take a winter vacation.
  40 employees take both a winter and a summer vacation.
  20 employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.
  Therefore, 100 - 20 = 80 employees take at least one vacation.
  Let x be the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Then, the number of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation is 40 - x.
  The number of employees who take only a winter vacation is 75 - (40 - x) = 35 + x.
  The number of employees who take only a summer vacation is x.
  Therefore, the total number of employees who take a summer vacation is x + (40 - x) = 40.
  The number of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation is 20.
  Therefore, the total number of employees in the company is 100.
  We can now set up an equation to solve for x:
  x + 35 + x + 20 + 40 = 100
  2x + 95 = 100
  2x = 5
  x = 2.5
  Therefore, Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 2.5%.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?
Choices:
  A:  13.3542
  B:  15.8113
  C:  18.3451
  D:  19.5667
  E:  20.8888
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  A rectangular solid is a 3D shape with six faces, where each face is a rectangle.
  The dimensions of the rectangular solid are 3 x 4 x 15.
  The diameter of a sphere is twice the radius of the sphere.
Thought:
  The sphere circumscribes the rectangular solid, so the diameter of the sphere is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
  The diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
  The diagonal of the rectangular solid is sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(250).
  The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius of the sphere, which is equal to half the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
  Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2 * sqrt(250) / 2 = sqrt(250).
  Simplifying sqrt(250) = sqrt(25 * 10) = 5 * sqrt(10).
Criticism:
  The answer is not one of the given choices.
  However, the closest answer is B: 15.8113, which is approximately equal to 5 * sqrt(10).

Knowledge:
  A rectangular solid is a 3D shape with six faces, where each face is a rectangle.
  The dimensions of the rectangular solid are 3 x 4 x 15.
  The diameter of a sphere is twice the radius of the sphere.
Thought:
  The sphere circumscribes the rectangular solid, so the diameter of the sphere is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
  The diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
  The diagonal of the rectangular solid is sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(250).
  The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius of the sphere, which is equal to half the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
  Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2 * sqrt(250) / 2 = sqrt(250).
  Simplifying sqrt(250) = sqrt(25 * 10) = 5 * sqrt(10).

Topic: Math
Question: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ?
Choices:
  A: 43 seconds
  B: 39 seconds
  C: 20 seconds
  D: 33 seconds
  E: 55 seconds
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The train takes 3 seconds to enter the 1-mile long tunnel.
  - The train is traveling at a speed of 120 miles per hour.
Thought:
  - The train travels 1 mile in 1/120 hours (or 1/120 * 60 * 60 seconds).
  - The train's length is the distance it travels during the time it takes to completely pass through the tunnel.
  - The train enters the tunnel and then completely passes through it, so the total time it spends in the tunnel is 3 seconds plus the time it takes to completely pass through the tunnel.
  - Let's call the length of the train "L". The train travels a distance of L to completely pass through the tunnel.
  - The total distance the train travels to completely pass through the tunnel is 1 mile + L.
  - We know that the train travels at a speed of 120 miles per hour, so we can set up the equation:
    (1 mile + L)/(120 miles/hour) = (3 seconds + x)
  - We need to convert the units of the time to be consistent, so we'll convert 3 seconds to hours:
    3 seconds = 3/60/60 hours = 0.00083 hours
  - Substituting in the values, we get:
    (1 mile + L)/(120 miles/hour) = (0.00083 hours + x)
  - Solving for L, we get:
    L = (120 miles/hour) * (0.00083 hours + x) - 1 mile
    L = 0.1 miles + 120x - 1 mile
    L = 119x - 0.9 miles
  - We know that L is the length of the train, which is a positive value, so we can set up the inequality:
    L > 0
    119x - 0.9 miles > 0
    119x > 0.9 miles
    x > 0.0076 hours
  - We need to convert the time back to seconds:
    x > 0.0076 hours * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute
    x > 27.36 seconds
  - Therefore, it will take more than 27.36 seconds for the train to completely pass through the tunnel.
  - The only answer choice that is greater than 27.36 seconds is D: 33 seconds.

Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
Choices:
  A: 1,879
  B: 1,875
  C: 1,876
  D: 1,872
  E: 1,800
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Profit = (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price * 100%
  Discount = (Discount Amount / Marked Price) * 100%
Thought:
  Let's assume the marked price is x.
  The cost price is Rs. 1200/-
  Karan wants to make a 20% profit even after offering a 20% discount.
  So, the selling price after the discount would be 0.8x.
  And, the profit Karan wants to make is 20% of the cost price, which is 0.2 * 1200 = Rs. 240/-
  Therefore, the selling price before the discount would be 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440/-
  Now, we can use the formula for discount to find the marked price:
  20 = (x - 0.8x) / x * 100%
  20 = 0.2x / x * 100%
  20 = 20%
  So, the marked price is x = Rs. 1800/-
  Therefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800/-.
  But, he should offer a 20% discount on the marked price to sell it at a selling price of Rs. 1440/- and make a 20% profit.
  So, the selling price after the discount would be 0.8 * 1800 = Rs. 1440/-

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
Choices:
  A: 4,000
  B: 4,200
  C: 4,500
  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective.
  2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.
  72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected.
Thought:
  Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers on Monday.
  The number of defective staplers produced on Monday is 10% of x, which is 0.1x.
  The number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday is 90% of x, which is 0.9x.
  2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, which is 0.02 * 0.9x = 0.018x.
  The total number of staplers rejected is the sum of defective and non-defective staplers rejected, which is 0.1x + 0.018x = 0.118x.
  We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so 0.018x = 72.
  Solving for x, we get x = 4000.
  Therefore, the number of staplers produced on Monday is 4000.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: My wall contains 8 red colour ties, 13 violet colour ties,10 blue colour ties, 5 pink colour ties, 4 green colour ties. If electricity is gone and I want at least two ties of same colour then how many ties I should take out from my rack?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
  E: 6
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  To ensure that at least two ties are of the same color, we need to apply the Pigeonhole Principle.
  The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are n items to be placed into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.
Thought:
  We need to find the minimum number of ties we need to take out to ensure that at least two ties are of the same color.
  The worst-case scenario is that we take out one tie of each color, which gives us a total of 8+13+10+5+4 = 40 ties.
  If we take out one more tie, then we will have at least two ties of the same color.
  Therefore, we need to take out 5+1 = 6 ties to ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color.
  The answer is E: 6.
Criticism:
  There is no flaw in the logic or reasoning.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  If two events A and B are independent, then the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).
  The probability of at least one of two events occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of both events occurring: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).
Thought:
  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
  We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96.
  We need to find P(B).
  We can rearrange the formula for P(A or B) to solve for P(B):
  P(B) = (P(A or B) - P(A)) / (1 - P(A and B))
  Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6 * P(B).
  Substituting the values we know:
  P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6 * P(B))
  Simplifying:
  0.4 + 0.6 * P(B) = 0.96
  0.6 * P(B) = 0.56
  P(B) = 0.56 / 0.6
  P(B) = 0.9333 (rounded to four decimal places)
  The closest answer choice is E: 0.9.

Topic: Math
Question: The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100%
Choices:
  A: 41.86%
  B: 42.86%
  C: 43.86%
  D: 44.86%
  E: 45.86%
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  When the price of a product is reduced by x%, the new price is (100-x)% of the original price.
  To find the percentage increase to make the new price 100%, we need to find the percentage increase from the new price to the original price.
Thought:
  If the price of a product is reduced by 30%, the new price is 70% of the original price.
  To make the new price 100%, we need to increase it by (100-70)% = 30% of the new price.
  Let P be the original price, then the new price is 0.7P.
  To make the new price 100%, we need to increase it by 0.3(0.7P) = 0.21P.
  The percentage increase is (0.21P/P) x 100% = 21%.
  Therefore, the answer is not one of the given choices.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again?
Choices:
  A: 1 hour and 31 minutes
  B: 2 hour and 31 minutes
  C: 3 hour and 31 minutes
  D: 4 hour and 31 minutes
  E: 5 hour and 31 minutes
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The time it takes for a ball to make one full rotation is the period of rotation.
  - The period of rotation is the inverse of the frequency of rotation.
  - The frequency of rotation is the number of full rotations per unit time.
  - The balls will meet again at the starting point when they have made the same number of full rotations.
Thought:
  - Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so its frequency of rotation is 2/26 = 1/13 rotations per minute.
  - Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so its frequency of rotation is 5/35 = 1/7 rotations per minute.
  - The two balls will meet again at the starting point when they have made the same number of full rotations.
  - The time it takes for the two balls to make the same number of full rotations is the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of rotation.
  - The period of rotation of ball A is 1/frequency of rotation of ball A = 13 minutes.
  - The period of rotation of ball B is 1/frequency of rotation of ball B = 7 minutes.
  - The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91.
  - Therefore, the two balls will meet again at the starting point after 91 minutes.
  - This is equivalent to 1 hour and 31 minutes.

Topic: Math
Question: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
Choices:
  A: 58
  B: 62
  C: 66
  D: 70
  E: 74
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.
  - Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced.
  - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.
Thought:
  - Let's assume that the length of the rectangular yard is l and the width is w.
  - We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we can write the equation: l * w = 240.
  - We also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the perimeter of the yard is P = 2l + w + 10.
  - We can substitute the value of w from the first equation into the second equation to get: P = 2l + 240/l + 10.
  - We want to find the value of P, which is the amount of fencing Alice needs. To do this, we need to find the value of l that minimizes the value of P.
  - We can take the derivative of P with respect to l and set it equal to zero to find the minimum value of P. The derivative is: dP/dl = 2 - 240/l^2.
  - Setting this equal to zero and solving for l, we get: l = sqrt(120).
  - Substituting this value of l back into the equation for P, we get: P = 2sqrt(120) + 20sqrt(6) ≈ 62.1.
  - Therefore, Alice needs approximately 62 meters of fencing.
  - The answer is B: 62.
Criticism:
  - The thought process and calculations are correct.
  - However, the answer is an approximation, so it may not match exactly with any of the given choices.
  - The closest choice is B: 62, so that is the best answer.

  - We also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. This means that the perimeter of the yard is P = 2l + w + 10.
  - We can substitute the value of w from the first equation into the second equation to get: P = 2l + 240/l + 10.
  - We want to find the value of P, which is the amount of fencing Alice needs. To do this, we need to find the value of l that minimizes the value of P.
  - We can take the derivative of P with respect to l and set it equal to zero to find the minimum value of P. The derivative is: dP/dl = 2 - 240/l^2.
  - Setting this equal to zero and solving for l, we get: l = sqrt(120).
  - Substituting this value of l back into the equation for P, we get: P = 2sqrt(120) + 20sqrt(6) ≈ 62.1.
  - Therefore, Alice needs approximately 62 meters of fencing.
  - The answer is B: 62.
Criticism:
  - The thought process and calculations are correct.
  - However, the answer is an approximation, so it may not match exactly with any of the given choices.
  - The closest choice is B: 62, so that is the best answer.

  The answer is none of the above.
Criticism:
  The answer is not one of the given choices.
  The closest answer is A: 126, which is not correct.
  Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Let's assume the train fare for one person is x.
  The bus fare for two persons is 4/3 times the train fare for one person.
  The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512.
Thought:
  Let's assume the bus fare for two persons is y.
  Then, y = (4/3)x
  The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 3y.
  The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8x.
  According to the question, 3y + 8x = 1512.
  Substituting y = (4/3)x, we get 3(4/3)x + 8x = 1512.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 16x = 1512.
  Therefore, x = 94.5.
  Hence, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs.94.5.
  The answer is none of the above.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
Choices:
  A: 20%
  B: 25%
  C: 30%
  D: 35%
  E: 40%
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Jim's dog ate once an hour, starting at 8:00 am and ending at noon, which is a total of 4 hours.
  - At each feeding session, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining food in the bowl.
Thought:
  - Let's assume that the original amount of dog food in the bowl was 100 units (this is an arbitrary number, but it will make the calculations easier).
  - At the first feeding session (9:00 am), the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 100 units, which is 1/3 * 100 = 33.33 units. This leaves 66.67 units of food in the bowl.
  - At the second feeding session (10:00 am), the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 66.67 units, which is 1/3 * 66.67 = 22.22 units. This leaves 44.45 units of food in the bowl.
  - At the third feeding session (11:00 am), the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 44.45 units, which is 1/3 * 44.45 = 14.82 units. This leaves 29.63 units of food in the bowl.
  - At the fourth and final feeding session (12:00 pm), the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 29.63 units, which is 1/3 * 29.63 = 9.88 units. This leaves 19.75 units of food in the bowl.
  - Therefore, right before the dog began to eat at noon, there were 19.75 units of food in the bowl.
  - To find the percentage of the original food that was in the bowl, we can divide the remaining amount of food (19.75 units) by the original amount of food (100 units) and multiply by 100%: (19.75/100) * 100% = 19.75%
  - So, approximately 19.75% of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon.
  - This is closest to answer A: 20%
Criticism:
  - The calculation is correct, but it is important to note that the assumption of the original amount of dog food being 100 units was arbitrary and may not be accurate.
  - Additionally, the question asks for an approximate percentage, so answer A: 20% may also be a reasonable choice.

  A: $8
  B: $10
  C: $13.6
  D: $22.9
  E: $40
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  1. Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%.
  2. We need to find the new selling price of each article.
Thought:
  1. Let the original price of each article be x.
  2. After the price of each article decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is (100% - 15%) * x = 0.85x.
  3. Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles is now $300 + $5x.
  4. We can set up an equation: $300 + $5x = 0.85x * (5 + x).
  5. Solving for x, we get x = $13.6.
  6. Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 0.85 * $13.6 = $11.56.

Question: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope?
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 8.9
  C: 9.9
  D: 11.5
  E: 11.7
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The total length of the rope is 20 meters.
  One piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the other.
Thought:
  Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?
Choices:
  A: 20%
  B: 28%
  C: 36%
  D: 40%
  E: 42%
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance is x.
  The original retail price of the appliance is 60% more than the wholesale cost, which means it is 1.6x.
  The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which means it was sold for 0.8(1.6x) = 1.28x.
Thought:
  The difference between the selling price and the wholesale cost is (1.28x - x) = 0.28x.
  To find the percentage more than the wholesale cost, we need to divide the difference by the wholesale cost and multiply by 100.
  So, the percentage more than the wholesale cost is (0.28x/x) * 100 = 28%.
  Therefore, the answer is B: 28%.

  To find the percentage more than the wholesale cost, we need to divide the difference by the wholesale cost and multiply by 100.
  So, the percentage more than the wholesale cost is (0.28x/x) * 100 = 28%.
  Therefore, the answer is B: 28%.

  Let's assume the wholesale cost of the appliance is x.
  The original retail price of the appliance is 60% more than the wholesale cost, which means it is 1.6x.
  The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which means it was sold for 0.8(1.6x) = 1.28x.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 1120
  C: 792
  D: 1320
  E: 1200
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
  The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width.
Thought:
  Let the length and width of the rectangle be l and w, respectively.
  When folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48cm, so the length of each part is 24cm.
  When folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66cm, so the width of each part is 33cm.
  Therefore, we have the equations:
    2l + w = 48
    l + 2w = 66
  Solving for l and w, we get:
    l = 18, w = 6
  The area of the rectangle is lw = 18 x 6 = 108.
  When folded, we get two equal parts, so the area of each part is 54.
  Therefore, the answer is 54 x 2 = 108.
  The answer is E: 1200.
Criticism:
  There seems to be an error in the calculation.
  The length and width of the rectangle should be 18cm and 6cm, respectively.
  The area of the rectangle is 18 x 6 = 108.
  When folded, we get two equal parts, so the area of each part is 54.
  Therefore, the answer is 54 x 2 = 108.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 12
  C: 16
  D: 24
  E: 25
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let's assume the number of friends who planned to go on a picnic is "x".
  The total amount they planned to spend on eatables is Rs. 96.
  Four of them did not turn up, so the remaining friends are "x-4".
  Each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra.
Thought:
  The total amount they planned to spend on eatables is Rs. 96.
  So, the amount each friend would have to contribute if all of them attended the picnic is 96/x.
  But, four of them did not turn up, so the remaining friends are "x-4".
  Each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, so the new amount each friend contributed is (96/x) + 4.
  We can set up an equation to solve for "x":
  96/x = (96/x) + 4
  Subtracting (96/x) from both sides, we get:
  0 = 4
  This is not possible, so there must be an error in our logic or reasoning.
Criticism:
  There seems to be an error in our equation or thought process.
  We cannot have 0 = 4, so we need to re-evaluate our approach.
  One possible issue is that we assumed that the total amount spent by the remaining friends is still Rs. 96, which may not be true.
Action: None of the above.

Question: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We know that there are more than 501 students in the school.
  20% of the students took physics.
  28% of the students took math.
Thought:
  Let's assume that the least possible number of students in the school is x.
  According to the problem, 20% of the students took physics. So, the number of students who took physics is 0.2x.
  Similarly, 28% of the students took math. So, the number of students who took math is 0.28x.
  The total number of students who took either physics or math is the sum of the number of students who took physics and the number of students who took math.
  So, the total number of students who took either physics or math is 0.2x + 0.28x = 0.48x.
  We know that the total number of students who took either physics or math is more than 501.
  So, 0.48x > 501.
  Solving for x, we get x > 1043.75.
  Since x has to be an integer, the least possible value of x is 1044.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which
Choices:
  A: L(x,y) = R(x,y)
  B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
  C: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
  D: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
  E: None
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
  L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]
  R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]
Thought:
  Let's consider each option one by one.
  A: L(x,y) = R(x,y)
     [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y]
     We know that [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] and [2x] ≤ 2[x] and [2y] ≤ 2[y]
     Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [2x] + [2y] + 1
     But, [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] for some x and y
     Therefore, [2x] + [2y] + 1 ≤ [2x] + [2y]
     This is a contradiction, so option A is not possible.
  B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
     This option is possible. For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 1.5
     L(x,y) = [1.5] + [1.5] + [3] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
     R(x,y) = [3] + [3] = 3 + 3 = 6
     Therefore, L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) for these values of x and y.
  C: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
     This option is not possible. We know that [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y], so
     L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] + [x] + [y] = 2[x] + 2[y] = R(x,y)
     Therefore, L(x,y) cannot be less than R(x,y).
  D: L(x,y) > R(x,y)
     This option is possible. For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 1.5
     L(x,y) = [1.5] + [1.5] + [3] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
     R(x,y) = [3] + [3] = 3 + 3 = 6
     Therefore, L(x,y) > R(x,y) for these values of x and y.
  E: None
     This is not the correct answer as option B is possible.
Conclusion:
  Option B is possible, so the answer is Answer("B").
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
  L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]
  R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]
Thought:
  Let's consider each option one by one.
  A: L(x,y) = R(x,y)
     [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y]
     We know that [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] and [2x] ≤ 2[x] and [2y] ≤ 2[y]
     Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [2x] + [2y] + 1
     But, [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] for some x and y
     Therefore, [2x] + [2y] + 1 ≤ [2x] + [2y]
     This is a contradiction, so option A is not possible.
  B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
     This option is possible. For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 1.5
     L(x,y) = [1.5] + [1.5] + [3] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
     R(x,y) = [3] + [3] = 3 + 3 = 6
     Therefore, L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) for these values of x and y.
  C: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
     This option is not possible. We know that [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y], so
     L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] + [x] + [y] = 2[x] + 2[y] = R(x,y)
     Therefore, L(x,y) cannot be less than R(x,y).
  D: L(x,y) > R(x,y)
     This option is possible. For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 1.5
     L(x,y) = [1.5] + [1.5] + [3] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
     R(x,y) = [3] + [3] = 3 + 3 = 6
     Therefore, L(x,y) > R(x,y) for these values of x and y.
  E: None
     This is not the correct answer as option B is possible.
Conclusion:
  Option B is possible, so the answer is Answer("B").
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
  L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]
  R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]
Thought:
  Let's consider each option one by one.
  A: L(x,y) = R(x,y)
     [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y]
     We know that [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] and [2x] ≤ 2[x] and [2y] ≤ 2[y]
     Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [2x] + [2y] + 1
     But, [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] for some x and y
     Therefore, [2x] + [2y] + 1 ≤ [2x] + [2y]
     This is a contradiction, so option A is not possible.
  B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
     This option is possible. For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 1.5
     L(x,y) = [1.5] + [1.5] + [3] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
     R(x,y) = [3] + [3] = 3 + 3 = 6
     Therefore, L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) for these values of x and y.
  C: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
     This option is not possible. We know that [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y], so
     L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] + [x] + [y] = 2[x] + 2[y] = R(x,y)
     Therefore, L(x,y) cannot be less than R(x,y).
  D: L(x,y) > R(x,y)
     This option is possible. For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 1.5
     L(x,y) = [1.5] + [1.5] + [3] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
     R(x,y) = [3] + [3] = 3 + 3 = 6
     Therefore, L(x,y) > R(x,y) for these values of x and y.
  E: None
     This is not the correct answer as option B is possible.
Conclusion:
  Option B is possible, so the answer is Answer("B").

     We know that [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] and [2x] ≤ 2[x] and [2y] ≤ 2[y]
     Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [2x] + [2y] + 1
     But, [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] for some x and y
     Therefore, [2x] + [2y] + 1 ≤ [2x] + [2y]
     This is a contradiction, so option A is not possible.
  B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
     This option is possible. For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 1.5
     L(x,y) = [1.5] + [1.5] + [3] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
     R(x,y) = [3] + [3] = 3 + 3 = 6
     Therefore, L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) for these values of x and y.
  C: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
     This option is not possible. We know that [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y], so
     L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] + [x] + [y] = 2[x] + 2[y] = R(x,y)
     Therefore, L(x,y) cannot be less than R(x,y).
  D: L(x,y) > R(x,y)
     This option is possible. For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 1.5
     L(x,y) = [1.5] + [1.5] + [3] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
     R(x,y) = [3] + [3] = 3 + 3 = 6
     Therefore, L(x,y) > R(x,y) for these values of x and y.
  E: None
     This is not the correct answer as option B is possible.
Conclusion:
  Option B is possible, so the answer is Answer("B").
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
  L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]
  R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]
Thought:
  Let's consider each option one by one.
  A: L(x,y) = R(x,y)

     We know that [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] and [2x] ≤ 2[x] and [2y] ≤ 2[y]
     Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [2x] + [2y] + 1
     But, [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] for some x and y
     Therefore, [2x] + [2y] + 1 ≤ [2x] + [2y]
     This is a contradiction, so option A is not possible.
  B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
     This option is possible. For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 1.5
     L(x,y) = [1.5] + [1.5] + [3] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
     R(x,y) = [3] + [3] = 3 + 3 = 6
     Therefore, L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) for these values of x and y.
  C: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
     This option is not possible. We know that [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y], so
     L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] + [x] + [y] = 2[x] + 2[y] = R(x,y)
     Therefore, L(x,y) cannot be less than R(x,y).
  D: L(x,y) > R(x,y)
     This option is possible. For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 1.5

     R(x,y) = [3] + [3] = 3 + 3 = 6
     Therefore, L(x,y) > R(x,y) for these values of x and y.
  E: None

     Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [2x] + [2y] + 1
     But, [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] for some x and y
     Therefore, [2x] + [2y] + 1 ≤ [2x] + [2y]
     This is a contradiction, so option A is not possible.
  B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
     This option is possible. For example, let x = 1.5 and y = 1.5
     L(x,y) = [1.5] + [1.5] + [3] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
     R(x,y) = [3] + [3] = 3 + 3 = 6
     Therefore, L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) for these values of x and y.
  C: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
     This option is not possible. We know that [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y], so

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is:
Choices:
  A: Rs. 697.50
  B: Rs. 712.50
  C: Rs. 787.50
  D: Rs. 750
  E: Rs. 780
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Discount is calculated as a percentage of the marked price.
  Profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price.
Thought:
  Let the marked price of the watch be M.
  The shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, so the selling price is 0.95M.
  The profit earned is the difference between the selling price and the cost price.
  Let the cost price be C.
  So, the profit earned is 0.95M - C.
  If the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, the selling price is 0.93M.
  The profit earned is 0.93M - C, which is Rs. 15 less than the previous profit.
  So, 0.95M - C - 15 = 0.93M - C
  Simplifying, we get 0.02M = 15
  So, M = 750
  Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:
Choices:
  A: 2.6m
  B: 3.9m
  C: 4m
  D: 4.2m
  E: 4.4m
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Semi-perimeter of a room is half of the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5y.
  The cost of papering the walls of the room is Rs. 260.
  The width of the paper is 50cm, which is equal to 0.5m.
  The cost of the paper is Rs. 2 per meter.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
Thought:
  Let's assume the length, breadth, and height of the room are L, B, and H, respectively.
  The semi-perimeter of the room is (L + B + H)/2 = 5y.
  Therefore, L + B + H = 10y.
  The perimeter of the room is 2(L + B) = 4(L + B)/2 = 4y.
  Therefore, L + B = 2.5y.
  The area of the four walls of the room is 2H(L + B) = 5Hy.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260.
  The width of the paper is 0.5m, so the length of the paper required is (5Hy)/0.5 = 10Hy.
  The cost of the paper required is Rs. 2 per meter, so the cost of the paper required is 2 * 10Hy = 20Hy.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, so the area of the four walls is reduced by 15 sq.m.
  Therefore, the area of the four walls after deducting the area of the doors and windows is 5Hy - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260, so we can write the equation:
  20Hy = 260 + (5Hy - 15) * 2
  Solving this equation, we get Hy = 7.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 2 * 7/5 = 2.8m.

  Let's assume the length, breadth, and height of the room are L, B, and H, respectively.
  The semi-perimeter of the room is (L + B + H)/2 = 5y.
  Therefore, L + B + H = 10y.
  The perimeter of the room is 2(L + B) = 4(L + B)/2 = 4y.
  Therefore, L + B = 2.5y.
  The area of the four walls of the room is 2H(L + B) = 5Hy.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260.
  The width of the paper is 0.5m, so the length of the paper required is (5Hy)/0.5 = 10Hy.
  The cost of the paper required is Rs. 2 per meter, so the cost of the paper required is 2 * 10Hy = 20Hy.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, so the area of the four walls is reduced by 15 sq.m.
  Therefore, the area of the four walls after deducting the area of the doors and windows is 5Hy - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260, so we can write the equation:
  20Hy = 260 + (5Hy - 15) * 2
  Solving this equation, we get Hy = 7.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 2 * 7/5 = 2.8m.

Question: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 24
  C: 25
  D: 40
  E: 52
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes.
  The sales person wants to reach a salary of at least $1000.
  Each sale is worth $250.
Thought: 
  Let's assume the sales person makes x sales.
  The total amount of money he makes from the sales is 0.1 * 250 * x = 25x.
  The total amount of money he makes is the sum of the money he makes from the sales and his salary.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 25x + S >= 1000, where S is his salary.
  We want to solve for x.
  S >= 1000 - 25x
  We know that S >= 1000, so we can substitute that in the inequality.
  1000 >= 1000 - 25x
  25x >= 0
  x >= 0
  Since x is the number of sales, it must be a positive integer.
  Therefore, the smallest integer value of x that satisfies the inequality is x = 40.
  Therefore, the answer is D: 40.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes.
  The sales person wants to reach a salary of at least $1000.
  Each sale is worth $250.
Thought: 
  Let's assume the sales person makes x sales.
  The total amount of money he makes from the sales is 0.1 * 250 * x = 25x.
  The total amount of money he makes is the sum of the money he makes from the sales and his salary.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 25x + S >= 1000, where S is his salary.
  We want to solve for x.
  S >= 1000 - 25x
  We know that S >= 1000, so we can substitute that in the inequality.
  1000 >= 1000 - 25x

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
Choices:
  A: 3km
  B: 2km
  C: 4km
  D: 5km
  E: 6km
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between two points in a plane.
  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
Thought:
  A starts 3km south, then travels 5km east, then 3km north, and finally 2km west.
  We can draw a diagram to represent A's movements.
  The 3km south and 3km north movements cancel each other out, as do the 5km east and 2km west movements.
  This leaves us with a right triangle with legs of 2km and 5km.
  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse, which represents the distance from A's final position to their starting position.
  c^2 = a^2 + b^2
  c^2 = 2^2 + 5^2
  c^2 = 4 + 25
  c^2 = 29
  c = sqrt(29)
  c is approximately 5.39km
  Therefore, A is approximately 5.39km from home.
  The closest answer choice is D: 5km.
Criticism:
  The closest answer choice is D: 5km, but the exact answer is approximately 5.39km.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: What should come in place of the question mark(?) in each of the following questions ?
a2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?)=(a - b)2
Choices:
  A: (a + b)(a - b)
  B: (a - b)2
  C: (a + b)2
  D: a3 + b3
  E: None of these
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
  (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
Thought:
  We can start by substituting the values of (a + b)2 and (a - b)2 in the given equation.
  (a + b)2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2
  (a2 + 2ab + b2) - b2/(a2 + 2ab + b2) = (a2 - 2ab + b2)
  Simplifying the equation, we get:
  (a2 + 2ab + b2) - b2(a2 + 2ab + b2)^-1 = (a2 - 2ab + b2)
  (a2 + 2ab + b2)^2 - b2 = (a2 - 2ab + b2)(a2 + 2ab + b2)
  a4 + 4a3b - 2a2b2 - 4ab3 + b4 - b2 = a4 - 2a3b + 2a2b2 - 2ab3 + b4
  6a3b - 4a2b2 - 2ab3 - b2 = 0
  2b(3a2 - 2ab - b2) = 0
  3a2 - 2ab - b2 = 0
  (3a + b)(a - b) = 0
  Therefore, a = b or a = -b/3
  Substituting a = b in the given equation, we get:
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2
  a2 - b2/4a2 = 0
  4a4 - b2 = 0
  b2 = 4a4
  b = 2a2
  Substituting b = 2a2 in the given equation, we get:
  a2 - 4a2/9 = (a - 2a)2
  a2 - 4a2/9 = a2/9
  5a2/9 = a2/9
  a2 = 0
  Therefore, a = 0
  Substituting a = 0 in the given equation, we get:
  -b2/b2 = b2
  -1 = b2/b2
  Therefore, the answer is E: None of these.
Criticism:
  The answer is not one of the given choices.
  The given equation is not true for any value of a and b.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
  (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
Thought:
  We can start by substituting the values of (a + b)2 and (a - b)2 in the given equation.
  (a + b)2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2
  (a2 + 2ab + b2) - b2/(a2 + 2ab + b2) = (a2 - 2ab + b2)
  Simplifying the equation, we get:
  (a2 + 2ab + b2) - b2(a2 + 2ab + b2)^-1 = (a2 - 2ab + b2)
  (a2 + 2ab + b2)^2 - b2 = (a2 - 2ab + b2)(a2 + 2ab + b2)
  a4 + 4a3b - 2a2b2 - 4ab3 + b4 - b2 = a4 - 2a3b + 2a2b2 - 2ab3 + b4
  6a3b - 4a2b2 - 2ab3 - b2 = 0
  2b(3a2 - 2ab - b2) = 0
  3a2 - 2ab - b2 = 0
  (3a + b)(a - b) = 0
  Therefore, a = b or a = -b/3
  Substituting a = b in the given equation, we get:
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2
  a2 - b2/4a2 = 0
  4a4 - b2 = 0
  b2 = 4a4

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300.
Choices:
  A: 20
  B: 30
  C: 40
  D: 200
  E: None
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  M is a three-digit number, so a, b, and c are digits.
  N is the number obtained by reversing the digits of M.
  M > N means that a > c or a = c and b > a.
  M - N is equal to (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99(a - c).
Thought:
  M - N + 396c = 990 can be simplified to 99(a - c) + 396c = 990.
  Dividing both sides by 9, we get 11(a - c) + 44c = 110.
  Simplifying further, we get a - c + 4c = 10, which gives a = 3 + c.
  Since M > N, we have a > c or a = c and b > a.
  If a > c, then a can be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and c can be 1, 2, or 3.
  If a = c and b > a, then a can be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, and b can be any digit except a.
  Since we want M to be more than 300, we have a = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
  If a > c, then there are 6 choices for a and 3 choices for c, giving 18 possibilities.
  If a = c and b > a, then there are 6 choices for a, 7 choices for b, and 1 choice for c, giving 42 possibilities.
  Therefore, there are 18 + 42 = 60 values of M that are more than 300.

  M - N is equal to (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99(a - c).
Thought:
  M - N + 396c = 990 can be simplified to 99(a - c) + 396c = 990.
  Dividing both sides by 9, we get 11(a - c) + 44c = 110.
  Simplifying further, we get a - c + 4c = 10, which gives a = 3 + c.
  Since M > N, we have a > c or a = c and b > a.
  If a > c, then a can be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and c can be 1, 2, or 3.
  If a = c and b > a, then a can be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, and b can be any digit except a.
  Since we want M to be more than 300, we have a = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
  If a > c, then there are 6 choices for a and 3 choices for c, giving 18 possibilities.
  If a = c and b > a, then there are 6 choices for a, 7 choices for b, and 1 choice for c, giving 42 possibilities.
  Therefore, there are 18 + 42 = 60 values of M that are more than 300.

Topic: Math
Question: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  A invested Rs.40,000 and started the business.
  B joined after 2 months with Rs.60,000.
  C joined after some more time with Rs.120,000.
  The total profit at the end of the year was Rs.375,000.
  C received Rs.150,000 as his share of the profit.
Thought:
  Let's assume C joined the business after x months of B joining.
  So, A invested for 12 months, B invested for (12-2) = 10 months, and C invested for (12-x) months.
  The ratio of their investments is (40,000*12):(60,000*10):(120,000*(12-x)) = 20:18:24-2x.
  The ratio of their profits should be the same as the ratio of their investments.
  Let's assume C's share of the profit is y.
  Then, (20+18+24-2x) = 375,000/y.
  We know that C's share of the profit is Rs.150,000.
  So, y = 150,000.
  Therefore, (20+18+24-2x) = 375,000/150,000 = 2.5.
  Solving for x, we get x = 4.
  Therefore, C joined the business 4 months after B joined.
  The answer is B: 4 months.

Response 2:
Knowledge:
  A invested Rs.40,000 and started the business.
  B joined after 2 months with Rs.60,000.
  C joined after some more time with Rs.120,000.
  The total profit at the end of the year was Rs.375,000.
  C received Rs.150,000 as his share of the profit.
Thought:
  Let's assume C joined the business after x months of B joining.
  So, A invested for 12 months, B invested for (12-2) = 10 months, and C invested for (12-x) months.
  The ratio of their investments is (40,000*12):(60,000*10):(120,000*(12-x)) = 20:18:24-2x.
  The ratio of their profits should be the same as the ratio of their investments.
  Let's assume C's share of the profit is y.
  Then, (20+18+24-2x) = 375,000/y.
  We know that C's share of the profit is Rs.150,000.
  So, y = 150,000.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 62
  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The sum of k consecutive integers can be found using the formula: sum = (k/2)(2a + (k-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and k is the number of terms.
  In this problem, the first term is -50.
Thought:
  Let's assume that the k consecutive integers start from -50 and go up to some integer x. 
  Then, the sum of these k integers can be expressed as: 
  sum = -50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + x
      = k(-50 + x)/2
  We know that the sum is 51, so we can set up the equation:
  51 = k(-50 + x)/2
  Multiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get:
  102 = k(-50 + x)
  We also know that x - (-50) = k - 1, since there are k terms in the sequence.
  Simplifying, we get:
  x + 50 = k - 1
  x = k - 51
  Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
  102 = k(-50 + k - 51)
  102 = k(k - 101)
  k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0
  Factoring, we get:
  (k - 1)(k - 100) = 0
  Therefore, k = 1 or k = 100.
  Since we are looking for a positive value of k, the answer is k = 100.
  The answer is E: 102.

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The sum of k consecutive integers can be found using the formula: sum = (k/2)(2a + (k-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and k is the number of terms.
  In this problem, the first term is -50.
Thought:
  Let's assume that the k consecutive integers start from -50 and go up to some integer x. 
  Then, the sum of these k integers can be expressed as: 
  sum = -50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + x
      = k(-50 + x)/2
  We know that the sum is 51, so we can set up the equation:
  51 = k(-50 + x)/2
  Multiplying both sides by 2 and simplifying, we get:
  102 = k(-50 + x)
  We also know that x - (-50) = k - 1, since there are k terms in the sequence.
  Simplifying, we get:
  x + 50 = k - 1
  x = k - 51
  Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
  102 = k(-50 + k - 51)
  102 = k(k - 101)
  k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0
  Factoring, we get:
  (k - 1)(k - 100) = 0
  Therefore, k = 1 or k = 100.
  Since we are looking for a positive value of k, the answer is k = 100.

  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The area of a triangle is given by the formula: (1/2) * base * height.
  The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.
  The original piece of cloth was a square.
  The perimeter of a square is given by the formula: 4 * side.
Thought:
  Let x be the length of one side of the original square piece of cloth.
  After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x.
  The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4) * x = x^2 - 4x.
  The two triangles have equal areas of 70 square feet each, so each triangle has an area of (1/2) * base * height = 70.
  Solving for the base or height of each triangle, we get base = height = sqrt(280).
  The diagonal of the rectangular piece is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs (x-4) and sqrt(280).
  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get (x-4)^2 + 280 = x^2.
  Simplifying, we get 16x - 112 = 0, so x = 7.
  Therefore, the original piece of cloth had a perimeter of 4x = 28 feet.
  The answer is A: 56.

Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, where l is the length and w is the width.
  If three sides of a rectangle are painted, then the unpainted side is opposite to the painted side with the same length.
Thought:
  Let's assume that the painted sides are x, y, and z, where z is the unpainted side.
  We know that z = 9 feet.
  We also know that x + y + z = 37 feet.
  Since z = 9 feet, we can rewrite the equation as x + y = 28 feet.
  We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to solve for the width w:
  A = l * w
  w = A / l
  We can substitute x and y for l and solve for w:
  w = A / (x + y)
  We know that w * z = A, so we can substitute z = 9 feet and w = A / (x + y) to get:
  A = 9 * (x + y)
  We also know that x + y = 28 feet, so we can substitute to get:
  A = 9 * 28 = 252 square feet.
  Therefore, the area of the parking space is 252 square feet.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 15
  C: 12
  D: 6
  E: 3
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let's assume that the rate of hose A is a and the rate of hose B is b.
  The formula for the rate of work is rate = work / time.
  The formula for the amount of work done is work = rate * time.
  The formula for the combined rate of two hoses is (a + b).
Thought:
  Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8.
  Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so the amount of work done by hose A is (1/8) * 2 = 1/4.
  The two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours, so the amount of work done by both hoses is (1/8 + b) * 3 = 3/8 + 3b.
  The total amount of work done is 1, so we can set up the equation: 1/4 + 3/8 + 3b = 1.
  Solving for b, we get b = 1/24.

  E: Cannot be determined
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Quadratic equation is of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
  The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is -b/a.
  The product of the roots of a quadratic equation is c/a.
Thought:
  Let's assume that the other root of the quadratic equation is r.
  Then, the sum of the roots is 1.5 + r = -m (from the quadratic equation).
  Also, the product of the roots is 1.5r = 22 (from the quadratic equation).
  We can solve for r by dividing both sides of the second equation by 1.5.
  r = 22/1.5 = 14.67.
  Substituting this value of r in the first equation, we get:
  1.5 + 14.67 = -m
  m = -16.17
  Therefore, the value of m is -16.17 (approximately).
  The answer is D: -16.2.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is:
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 11
  C: 12
  D: 13
  E: 14
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  When a number is divided by N, the remainder is always less than N.
  If two numbers have the same remainder when divided by N, then their difference is divisible by N.
Thought:
  Let the 3-digit number be N.
  Let the common remainder be R.
  Then, we can write:
    2272 = aN + R   ...(1)
     875 = bN + R   ...(2)
  where a and b are quotients.
  Subtracting (2) from (1), we get:
   1397 = (a-b)N
  Since N is a 3-digit number, it must be a factor of 1397.
  The prime factors of 1397 are 17 and 83.
  Since N is a 3-digit number, it cannot be equal to 1, 17, or 83.
  Therefore, N must be 34, 51, 68, or 34x51=1734.
  We need to find the sum of the digits of N.
  If N = 34, then sum of digits = 3+4 = 7.
  If N = 51, then sum of digits = 5+1 = 6.
  If N = 68, then sum of digits = 6+8 = 14.
  If N = 1734, then sum of digits = 1+7+3+4 = 15.
  Out of these options, only 14 is given in the choices.
  Therefore, the answer is E: 14.

Topic: Math
Question: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 8
  C: 22
  D: 50
  E: 20
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour.
  Jack finished two-thirds of the work, so the remaining portion of the work is one-third of the yacht.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate of cleaning, so her rate of cleaning is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour.
Thought:
  Jack finished two-thirds of the work, so the remaining portion of the work is one-third of the yacht.
  Let's assume that it takes Jill x hours to finish the remaining work.
  Jack's rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour, so he can clean one-third of the yacht in (1/12) * (1/3) = 1/36 hours.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is 1/240 of the yacht per hour, so she can clean one-third of the yacht in x * (1/240).
  Together, Jack and Jill can clean one-third of the yacht in 1/36 + x * (1/240) hours.
  We know that Jack finished two-thirds of the work, so we can set up the equation:
  2/3 = 1/36 + x * (1/240)
  Solving for x, we get:
  x = 22

  Jack's rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour, so he can clean one-third of the yacht in (1/12) * (1/3) = 1/36 hours.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is 1/240 of the yacht per hour, so she can clean one-third of the yacht in x * (1/240).
  Together, Jack and Jill can clean one-third of the yacht in 1/36 + x * (1/240) hours.
  We know that Jack finished two-thirds of the work, so we can set up the equation:
  2/3 = 1/36 + x * (1/240)
  Solving for x, we get:
  x = 22
  Therefore, it takes Jill 22 hours to finish the remaining work.

Question: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
Choices:

Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin.
  The coin-diver gets 25 cents for each brass coin.
  After one dive, the coin-diver got $3.40.
Thought:
  Let's assume that the coin-diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  The coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin, so the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20x cents.
  The coin-diver gets 25 cents for each brass coin, so the total amount of money she gets for brass coins is 25y cents.
  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation:
  20x + 25y = 340
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  Let's try to solve the equation for x in terms of y:
  20x + 25y = 340
  20x = 340 - 25y
  x = (340 - 25y) / 20
  Since x has to be a whole number, we need to find a value of y that makes (340 - 25y) divisible by 20.
  The only value of y that satisfies this condition is y = 2.
  If y = 2, then x = (340 - 25*2) / 20 = 3.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 3.

  The coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin.
  The coin-diver gets 25 cents for each brass coin.
  After one dive, the coin-diver got $3.40.
Thought:
  Let's assume that the coin-diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  The coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin, so the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20x cents.
  The coin-diver gets 25 cents for each brass coin, so the total amount of money she gets for brass coins is 25y cents.
  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation:
  20x + 25y = 340
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  Let's try to solve the equation for x in terms of y:
  20x + 25y = 340
  20x = 340 - 25y
  x = (340 - 25y) / 20
  Since x has to be a whole number, we need to find a value of y that makes (340 - 25y) divisible by 20.
  The only value of y that satisfies this condition is y = 2.
  If y = 2, then x = (340 - 25*2) / 20 = 3.

Knowledge:
  Let the three digit number be represented by abc, where a, b, and c are digits.
  The sum of the digits of a three digit number abc is a + b + c.
  The sum of the squares of the digits of a three digit number abc is a^2 + b^2 + c^2.
Thought:
  We know that a + b + c = 17 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.
  We want to find the number abc such that abc - 495 = cba.
  We can write abc as 100a + 10b + c, and cba as 100c + 10b + a.
  Therefore, we have the equation 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a.
  Simplifying this equation, we get 99a - 99c = 495, or a - c = 5.
  We also know that a + b + c = 17, so we can substitute a - c = 5 to get 2a + b = 22.
  We can now use trial and error to find values of a, b, and c that satisfy these equations.
  We can start with a = 9, which gives us c = 4 and b = 4.
  Checking these values, we see that 944 - 495 = 449, which is not equal to 449.
  We can try a = 8, which gives us c = 3 and b = 6.
  Checking these values, we see that 836 - 495 = 341, which is equal to 143.
  Therefore, the number we are looking for is 836.

Question: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is?
Choices:
  A: 2: π
  B: 7:2
  C: 8:2
  D: 6: π
  E: 8:3
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The volume of a cube is given by V_cube = s^3, where s is the length of one side of the cube.
  - The volume of a sphere is given by V_sphere = (4/3)πr^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.
  - If a sphere is inscribed inside a cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube.
Thought:
  - Let s be the edge length of the cube, and let r be the radius of the inscribed sphere.
  - The diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube, so 2r = s.
  - Solving for r, we get r = s/2.

Knowledge:
  This is a combination problem where we need to find the number of ways to divide 10 lime soda bottles into two groups of 5 each.
  The formula for finding the number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!).
Thought:
  We need to find the number of ways to divide 10 lime soda bottles into two groups of 5 each.
  The order of the groups does not matter, so we can use combinations.
  The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!).
  In this case, n = 10 and r = 5.
  So, the number of ways to create two groups is 10C5 = 10! / (5! * (10-5)!) = 252.
  Therefore, the answer is D: 252.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
Choices:
  A: 50
  B: 70
  C: 75
  D: 100
  E: 125
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 250 files on Sam's hard drive.
  - All files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both.
  - Let V be the number of files infected by a virus.
  - Let W be the number of files infected by a worm.
  - Let X be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
  - W = 2.5X (the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm).
Thought:
  - We know that V + W - X = 250 (the total number of files is the sum of the number of files infected only by a virus, the number of files infected only by a worm, and the number of files infected by both).
  - We also know that V = 0.5(250) = 125 (50% of the files were not infected by a virus).
  - Therefore, W - X = 250 - V = 250 - 125 = 125 (the number of files infected only by a worm or by both a virus and a worm).
  - Substituting W = 2.5X into the equation above, we get 2.5X - X = 125, which gives X = 50.
  - Therefore, W = 2.5X = 125, and the number of files infected only by a worm is W - X = 125 - 50 = 75.
  - The number of files that were not infected by a worm is 250 - (W - X) = 250 - 75 = 175.
  - Therefore, the answer is D: 100.

Question: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:

Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.
  - The cost of a newspaper on Sunday is $4.
  - The cost of a newspaper on the rest of the days of the week is $1.
  - The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers.
Thought:
  Let's call the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday "x". 
  Then, the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Sunday is "2x" (twice as many as Monday).
  The number of newspapers the hotel buys on the rest of the days of the week is "5x" (Monday through Saturday).
  The total cost of the newspapers is:
  4(2x) + 1(5x) = 8x + 5x = 13x
  We know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, so:
  13x = 210
  x = 210/13
  x ≈ 16.15
  Since the hotel can't buy a fraction of a newspaper, it must buy either 16 or 17 newspapers on Monday.
  If it buys 16 newspapers on Monday, then it buys 2*16 = 32 newspapers on Sunday and 5*16 = 80 newspapers on the rest of the days of the week.
  The total cost would be 4(32) + 1(80) = 128 + 80 = 208, which is too low.
  If it buys 17 newspapers on Monday, then it buys 2*17 = 34 newspapers on Sunday and 5*17 = 85 newspapers on the rest of the days of the week.
  The total cost would be 4(34) + 1(85) = 136 + 85 = 221, which is too high.
  Therefore, the hotel must buy 16 newspapers on Monday and the answer is A: 15.

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km
  E: 48km
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Distance = Speed x Time
  - Relative speed of Allen and Bob when they are moving towards each other = 54 + 78 = 132 kmph
  - Let the distance between X and Y be d km
Thought:
  - Let's assume that they meet for the second time after time t hours.
  - When they meet for the first time, the total distance they cover is d. So, we can write:
    d = 54t + 78t
    d = 132t
  - When they meet for the second time, the total distance they cover is 2d. So, we can write:
    2d = 54t + 78t + 48
    2d = 132t + 48
    2d = 48(11t/3 + 1)
    d = 24(11t/3 + 1)
  - We need to find the value of d.
  - We can find the value of t by substituting the value of d from equation 1 into equation 2:
    2d = 132t + 48
    2(132t/d) = 11t/3 + 1
    264/d = 11t/3 + 1
    11t/3 = 264/d - 1
    t = 3(d - 264)/(11d)
  - Substituting the value of t in equation 1:
    d = 132t/2
    d = 66t
    d = 66(3(d - 264)/(11d))
    11d = 198d - 17424
    187d = 17424
    d = 93.06 km
  - Therefore, the distance between X and Y is approximately 93.06 km.
  - The closest answer choice is C: 126 km.
Criticism:
  - The answer obtained is not exactly matching with any of the answer choices.
  - The answer is approximately 93.06 km, but the closest answer choice is C: 126 km.

Thought:
  Let's assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is x km/hr.
  Let's also assume the distance travelled by the jeep is d km.
  According to the problem, the time taken in the forward journey is 6 hours.
  Therefore, using the formula Distance = Speed x Time, we can say that d = 6x.
  During the return journey, the speed of the jeep increased by 12km/hr.
  Therefore, the speed of the jeep in the return journey is (x+12) km/hr.
  The time taken in the return journey is 4 hours.
  Therefore, using the formula Distance = Speed x Time, we can say that d = (x+12) x 4.
  We have two equations: d = 6x and d = (x+12) x 4.
  We can solve for x by equating the two equations: 6x = (x+12) x 4.

  Let's assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is x km/hr.
  Let's also assume the distance travelled by the jeep is d km.
  According to the problem, the time taken in the forward journey is 6 hours.
  Therefore, using the formula Distance = Speed x Time, we can say that d = 6x.
  During the return journey, the speed of the jeep increased by 12km/hr.
  Therefore, the speed of the jeep in the return journey is (x+12) km/hr.
  The time taken in the return journey is 4 hours.
  Therefore, using the formula Distance = Speed x Time, we can say that d = (x+12) x 4.
  We have two equations: d = 6x and d = (x+12) x 4.
  We can solve for x by equating the two equations: 6x = (x+12) x 4.
  Solving for x, we get x = 24.
  Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is d = 6x = 6 x 24 = 144 km.

Thought:
  If there is one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.
  This means that on the 59th day, there were half as many water lilies as needed to fully cover the lake.
  Therefore, on the 57th day, there were 1/4 as many water lilies as needed to fully cover the lake.
  On the 55th day, there were 1/8 as many water lilies as needed to fully cover the lake.
  Continuing this pattern, we can see that on the 6th day, there were 32 water lilies on the lake.

Question: A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
Choices:
  A: 1 hr 23 min
  B: 1 hr 15 min
  C: 1 hr 8 min
  D: 56 min
  E: 55 min
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, which means it takes 4 hours to travel from A to B.
  Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, which means it takes 3.5 hours to travel from B to A.
Thought:
  Let's assume that the two trains meet at time t hours after Train M leaves City A.
  In t hours, Train M would have traveled a distance of (4t/9) hours.
  In t hours, Train N would have traveled a distance of (7t/2) hours.
  The sum of the distances traveled by the two trains should be equal to the distance between City A and City B, which is 4 hours for Train M.
  Therefore, (4t/9) + (7t/2) = 4
  Solving for t, we get t = 8/11 hours, which is approximately 43.6 minutes.
  The two trains meet 43.6 minutes after Train M leaves City A.
  To find the actual time, we add 5 hours (the time Train M left City A) and 43.6 minutes.
  This gives us a total time of 5:43.6 am.

  Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, which means it takes 4 hours to travel from A to B.
  Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, which means it takes 3.5 hours to travel from B to A.
Thought:
  Let's assume that the two trains meet at time t hours after Train M leaves City A.
  In t hours, Train M would have traveled a distance of (4t/9) hours.
  In t hours, Train N would have traveled a distance of (7t/2) hours.
  The sum of the distances traveled by the two trains should be equal to the distance between City A and City B, which is 4 hours for Train M.
  Therefore, (4t/9) + (7t/2) = 4
  Solving for t, we get t = 8/11 hours, which is approximately 43.6 minutes.
  The two trains meet 43.6 minutes after Train M leaves City A.
  To find the actual time, we add 5 hours (the time Train M left City A) and 43.6 minutes.
  This gives us a total time of 5:43.6 am.
  Therefore, the two trains cross each other at 5:43.6 am.
  The answer is not one of the given choices.

  B: 41.6
  C: 42.2
  D: 43.5
  E: 44.8
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The average (arithmetic mean) of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the total number of numbers.
  We can use the formula: average = sum / number of items
Thought:
  Let's call the weight of the new heavy duty truck "x".
  The sum of the weights of the original 10 vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.
  After the new truck is added, there are 11 vehicles in the group.
  The new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.
  So, the sum of the weights of all 11 vehicles is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.
  The sum of the weights of the original 10 vehicles plus the weight of the new truck is 122 + x.
  We can set up an equation: (122 + x) / 11 = 14.8
  Solving for x: 122 + x = 11 * 14.8
  x = 44.8
  Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 44.8 tons.

Knowledge:
  The current mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay.
  We want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of sand and clay.
  We need to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand.
Thought:
  Let's assume that we have 10 kg of the mixture.
  The amount of sand in the mixture is 30% of 10 kg = 3 kg.
  The amount of clay in the mixture is 70% of 10 kg = 7 kg.
  In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of sand and clay, we need to have 3 kg of sand and 3 kg of clay.
  We need to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand.
  Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture.
  The amount of sand in the remaining mixture is still 3 kg, but the amount of clay is now 7-x kg.
  We need to add x kg of pure sand to the remaining mixture.
  The amount of sand in the new mixture is now 3+x kg, and the amount of clay is 7-x kg.
  We want the amount of sand and clay to be equal, so we set up the equation:
  3+x = 7-x
  Solving for x, we get x = 2.
  So we need to remove 2 kg of the mixture and replace it with 2 kg of pure sand.
  Therefore, the answer is A: 10/7.

  E: 97656
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to multiply the number of choices for each position.
  There are 26 choices for each letter position, since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet.
  There are 10 choices for each number position, since there are 10 digits (0-9).
Thought:
  We need to find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.
  There are 26 choices for the first letter position, and 26 choices for the second letter position.
  There are 10 choices for the first number position, and 10 choices for the second number position.
  Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is 26*26*10*10 = 67,600.
  All letters need to be distinct, since we are choosing 2 letters from a set of 26 without replacement.
  The answer is 67,600 and all letters need to be distinct.
Criticism:
  Your answer of 67,600 is correct, but your explanation that all letters need to be distinct is incorrect.
  The question only asks for the total number of distinct bike numbers, not the number of distinct bike numbers with distinct letters.
  Therefore, the answer is 67,600, but we do not need to worry about whether the letters are distinct or not.

Question: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre?
Choices:
  A: 3400
  B: 1700
  C: 3440
  D: Cannot be determined
  E: None of these
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Perimeter of a rectangle = 2(length + breadth)
  The given perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters.
  Let the length of the rectangular plot be L and the breadth be B.
  The cost of gardening 1 square meter of land is given as 10.
Thought:
  Perimeter of the rectangular plot = 2(L + B) = 340
  L + B = 170
  Let the breadth of the rectangular plot be 1 meter.
  Therefore, the length of the rectangular plot will be L + 2 (1 meter) on each side.
  The length of the rectangular plot will be L + 2 = (L + 1 + L + 1) = 2L + 2
  The area of the rectangular plot with a 1-meter boundary will be (L + 2) x (B + 2)
  Area of the rectangular plot = L x B
  Area of the 1-meter boundary = (L + 2) x (B + 2) - L x B
  Cost of gardening 1 square meter of land is given as 10.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary will be 10 times the area of the 1-meter boundary.
  Cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary = 10 x [(L + 2) x (B + 2) - L x B]
  Substituting L + B = 170, we get B = 170 - L
  Cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary = 10 x [(L + 2) x (170 - L + 2) - L x (170 - L)]
  Simplifying the above equation, we get:
  Cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary = 10 x (4L - L^2 + 176)
  Cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary = 40L - 10L^2 + 1760
  To find the cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary, we need to know the value of L.
  Therefore, the answer cannot be determined.

  Cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary = 10 x [(L + 2) x (B + 2) - L x B]
  Substituting L + B = 170, we get B = 170 - L
  Cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary = 10 x [(L + 2) x (170 - L + 2) - L x (170 - L)]
  Simplifying the above equation, we get:

  Therefore, the cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary will be 10 times the area of the 1-meter boundary.
  Cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary = 10 x [(L + 2) x (B + 2) - L x B]
  Substituting L + B = 170, we get B = 170 - L
  Cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary = 10 x [(L + 2) x (170 - L + 2) - L x (170 - L)]
  Simplifying the above equation, we get:
  Cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary = 10 x (4L - L^2 + 176)
  Cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary = 40L - 10L^2 + 1760
  To find the cost of gardening the 1-meter boundary, we need to know the value of L.
  Therefore, the answer cannot be determined.

  Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = 675 - 450 = Rs. 225.
  Percentage gain = (Profit/Cost Price) * 100 = (225/450) * 100 = 50%.
  Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 50%.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Percentage gain is calculated as (Profit/Cost Price) * 100.
  Cost Price is the price at which the merchant purchased the oranges.
  Profit is the difference between the Selling Price and the Cost Price.
  Selling Price is the price at which the merchant sold the oranges.
Thought:
  The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450.
  The cost price per kg of oranges is 450/90 = Rs. 5.
  The merchant sold the oranges at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.
  The selling price of 90 kg of oranges is 90 * 7.50 = Rs. 675.
  Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = 675 - 450 = Rs. 225.
  Percentage gain = (Profit/Cost Price) * 100 = (225/450) * 100 = 50%.
  Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 50%.

Question: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father?
Choices:
  A: 45
  B: 48
  C: 50
  D: 55
  E: 58
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.
  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
  And when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
Thought:
  Let's start by finding the age of Joe's sister.
  When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
  Let's assume that Joe's age at that time is x.
  So, Joe's father's age at that time will also be x.
  And Joe's sister's age at that time will be S + x - J.
  We know that Joe's sister's age at that time will be twice as old as now.
  So, S + x - J = 2S
  x = S + J
  Now, let's find the age of Joe's father.
  When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
  Let's assume that Joe's age at that time is y.
  So, Joe's father's age at that time will also be y.
  And Joe's sister's age at that time will be y - F + S.
  We know that Joe's father's age at that time will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
  So, 2(y - F + S) = F + y
  F = 3S - 2J
  We also know that J + S + F = 100.
  Substituting F, we get J + S + 3S - 2J = 100
  S + J = 50
  Substituting S + J = 50 in F = 3S - 2J, we get F = 50.
  Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 50.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.
  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
  And when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
Thought:
  Let's start by finding the age of Joe's sister.
  When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
  Let's assume that Joe's age at that time is x.
  So, Joe's father's age at that time will also be x.
  And Joe's sister's age at that time will be S + x - J.
  We know that Joe's sister's age at that time will be twice as old as now.
  So, S + x - J = 2S
  x = S + J
  Now, let's find the age of Joe's father.
  When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
  Let's assume that Joe's age at that time is y.
  So, Joe's father's age at that time will also be y.
  And Joe's sister's age at that time will be y - F + S.
  We know that Joe's father's age at that time will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
  So, 2(y - F + S) = F + y
  F = 3S - 2J
  We also know that J + S + F = 100.
  Substituting F, we get J + S + 3S - 2J = 100
  S + J = 50
  Substituting S + J = 50 in F = 3S - 2J, we get F = 50.
  Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 50.

  - Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.
  - Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph.
  - Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
Thought:
  - Let's assume that the distance between A and B is "d" miles.
  - Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so he took d/70 hours to reach B.
  - Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. So, he took d/90 hours to return to A.
  - Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already traveled (d-70) miles from A towards B.
  - We know that he had 3 hours left to complete his trip when he was 70 miles away from B. So, the total time he took for the entire trip was (d/70 + d/90 + 3) hours.
  - We can now form an equation using the above information:
    d - 70 = 70 * (d/70) + 90 * (d/90) - 3 * 90 * 70 / (70 + 90)

  - Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.
  - Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph.
  - Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
Thought:
  - Let's assume that the distance between A and B is "d" miles.
  - Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so he took d/70 hours to reach B.
  - Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. So, he took d/90 hours to return to A.
  - Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already traveled (d-70) miles from A towards B.
  - We know that he had 3 hours left to complete his trip when he was 70 miles away from B. So, the total time he took for the entire trip was (d/70 + d/90 + 3) hours.
  - We can now form an equation using the above information:
    d - 70 = 70 * (d/70) + 90 * (d/90) - 3 * 90 * 70 / (70 + 90)
  - Solving the above equation, we get d = 270 miles.
  - Therefore, the distance between A and B is 270 miles.

Question: I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
What is that number?
Choices:
  A: 42857
  B: 32456
  C: 76523
  D: 24567
  E: 43566
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The number is a 5-digit number.
  With a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
Thought:
  Let's assume the number is abcde.
  With a 1 after it, the number becomes abcde1.
  With a 1 before it, the number becomes 1abcde.
  According to the problem, abcde1 = 3 * 1abcde.
  Multiplying 3 to abcde, we get 3abcde.
  Subtracting abcde from abcde1, we get abcde1 - abcde = 10000 - 9999 = 1.
  Therefore, 3abcde - abcde = 1.
  Simplifying, we get 2abcde = 1.
  Solving for abcde, we get abcde = 5000.5.
  But abcde is a 5-digit number, so the first digit must be 5.
  Therefore, the number is 5bcde1.
  Substituting abcde = 5000, we get 5bcde1 = 50001 * 3 = 150003.

Question: An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization?
Choices:
  A: 300
  B: 200
  C: 400
  D: 100
  E: 500
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let's assume that there are 'n' employees in the organization.
  The organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each employee.
  If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh.
Thought:
  Let's assume that each employee contributes 'x' amount of money.
  Then, the total amount collected would be n*x.
  According to the question, n*x = 6,00,000.
  If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, then the new contribution per employee would be (x+60).
  The new total amount collected would be n*(x+60) = 6,24,000.
  Expanding this equation, we get n*x + 60n = 6,24,000.
  Substituting n*x = 6,00,000, we get 6,00,000 + 60n = 6,24,000.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Let the amount received by each nephew be x.
  Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x.
  Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x.
  There are 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews, for a total of 11 people.
  The total amount divided is Rs 8600.
Thought:
  Let's start by finding the total amount received by the nephews.
  There are 2 nephews, so they receive a total of 2x.
  There are 5 sons, so they receive a total of 5 * 5x = 25x.
  There are 4 daughters, so they receive a total of 4 * 4x = 16x.
  The total amount received is 2x + 25x + 16x = 43x.

  For each additional quarter-mile, we spend 10 cents, which means we spend 40 cents for each mile.
  Therefore, we can write the equation: 0.4(x-0.25) = 5.00 - 3.50
  Solving for x, we get x = 12.75 miles.
  Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.
  The answer is B: 12.75 miles.
Criticism:
  There is no apparent flaw in the logic and reasoning used to solve the problem.
Action: Answer("B")

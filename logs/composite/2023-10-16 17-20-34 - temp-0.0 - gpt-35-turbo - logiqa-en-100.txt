### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: The basis of life-the main component of protein is an amino acid molecule.It is an organic molecule.Although people have not directly observed amino acid molecules in cosmic space, scientists have used hydrogen, water, oxygen, methane and formaldehyde in the laboratory to simulate the natural conditions of space.Kinds of amino acids.The raw materials used to synthesize amino acids are abundant in interstellar molecules.It is not difficult to imagine that there must also be amino acid molecules in the universe.As long as there is an appropriate environment, they may be transformed into proteins and further develop into organic life.According to this speculation, there are living bodies on other planets than the earth, and may even be living bodies with higher intelligence.
Question: Which of the following is true to best refute the above speculation?
Choices:
  A: There is a huge difference between the process of developing from protein to organic life and the process from organic molecules to protein
  B: Higher intelligence is not only a product of material evolution, but also a product of continuous socialization

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Placebo effect" refers to the phenomenon of letting patients take fake drugs that have no effect at all without knowing it, but they can get the same or better effects than real drugs.The "placebo effect" has been supported by many clinical studies.One explanation for this phenomenon is that human expectations for the future will change the physiological state of the brain, which in turn will cause physiological changes throughout the body.
Question: The following statements can support the above explanation, except
Choices:
  A: The placebo effect is the result of a combination of factors.
  B: Placebo has no effect on Alzheimer's patients who have lost their expected future abilities.
  C: Some patients do not believe that the treatment will be effective.Although they have been treated normally, their condition has worsened.
  D: Inject the subject with normal saline and make him believe that it is an analgesic.The subject's brain then secretes the analgesic endorphin.

Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The polling agency investigated the causes of the terrorist attacks on September 11.
  40% of people believed that the attacks were caused by unfair foreign policy of the United States.
  55% of people believed that the attacks were caused by the conflict between Islamic civilization and Western civilization.
  23% of people believed that the attacks were caused by the evil nature of terrorists.
  19% of people did not express their views.
Thought:
  The statement is contradictory because the percentages add up to more than 100%.
  This could be due to a number of reasons, such as:
    - Overlapping categories (e.g. some people may believe that the attacks were caused by both unfair foreign policy and the conflict between Islamic and Western civilizations).
    - Respondents may have misunderstood the question or given multiple answers.
    - The sample may not be representative.
  Option A suggests that the sample may not be representative, which could explain the contradictory statement.
  Option B suggests that some respondents may have changed their views, but this does not explain why the percentages add up to more than 100%.
  Option C suggests that the causes of the attacks were not single but compound, but this does not explain why the percentages add up to more than 100%.
  Option D suggests that there are technical errors in the calculation of the investigation results, which could explain the contradictory statement.
  However, option A seems like the most likely explanation, as a non-random and non-representative sample could lead to over-representation of certain views and under-representation of others.

  1200 students took the final exam, and more than 400 failed.
  80% of the failed students were Chinese.
  The University of Sydney attributed the failure of Chinese students to a lack of critical thinking and poor English skills.
  The school's entrance examination requires IELTS 7 points.
Thought:
  Student representative L's complaint is based on a hypothesis that contradicts the University of Sydney's explanation for the high failure rate of Chinese students.
  The hypothesis is that the school's requirements for English language proficiency are sufficient for admission, but not for completing the course.
  Therefore, the school is responsible for the high failure rate of Chinese students, not the students themselves.
  The statement that best represents this hypothesis is C: The school's requirements for students' English language entry are the same as those required for completion of all subjects after enrollment.
Criticism:
  The statement does not directly address the issue of discrimination or renewal fees, which are mentioned in other options.
  However, it does address the core issue of whether the school's requirements for English language proficiency are sufficient for completing the course.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: twenty one.Standard antibiotics usually contain only one active ingredient, while herbal antibacterial drugs contain many.Therefore, herbal medicines are more likely to maintain their effectiveness than standard antibiotics when fighting new resistant bacteria.For the strain, it is difficult to develop resistance to herbal medicines, just as it is difficult for a chef to make a dish that can satisfy the taste of dozens of guests at the same time, and it is much easier to make a dish that meets the taste of one guest.
Question: Which of the following ways of reasoning is most similar to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: If you have a large deposit in the bank, your purchasing power will be strong.If your purchasing power is strong, you will be happy.Therefore, if your bank has a large amount of deposits, you will be happy.
  B: A full-term baby has a certain instinct reaction after birth that will disappear by 2 months.The baby has been 3 months old, and there is this instinctive reaction.Therefore, this baby was not born at full term.
  C: Depending on the size, the supermarket may require 1 to 3 security guards to prevent theft.If any supermarket decides to use 3 security guards, then it must be a big supermarket.
  D: Electric current passes through wires as water flows through pipes.Since a large-diameter pipeline has a larger flow rate than a small-diameter pipeline, a thicker wire has a larger amount of electricity than a thin wire.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: About 12,000 years ago, when the climate warmed, humans began to come to North America.At the same time, large mammals, such as mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers, became extinct from their once widespread North American soil.Therefore, contrary to the myth that humans lived in peace with other creatures in nature, as early as 12,000 years ago, human activities led to the extinction of these animals.
Question: Which of the following statements is the most vulnerable to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: This argument excludes humanity from nature without reflection.
  B: The arrival of humans in North America may also lead to the extinction of animals other than mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers.
  C: The extinction of large mammals such as mastodons, mammoths and saber-toothed tigers was of extraordinary significance to the primitive people of early North America.
  D: The evidence presented is equally applicable to two alternative hypotheses? climate change has led to the extinction of large mammals, and the same reasons have led humans to travel across North America.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  About 12,000 years ago, humans began to come to North America.
  At the same time, large mammals, such as mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers, became extinct from their once widespread North American soil.
Thought:
  The argument is that human activities led to the extinction of these animals.
  Option A is not vulnerable to the argument because it does not contradict the argument.
  Option B is not vulnerable to the argument because it supports the argument.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Why did ancient Greece have a city-state system, but there was a long-standing monarchy in Eastern countries? Aristotle believes that the monarchy is often seen among barbarians and is very close to the tyrant or tyrant system.Because the nature of the barbarian people is inherently more national and more enslaved than Greece, and the slavishness of the Asian barbarians is more than that of the Europa barbarians, so they are subject to dictatorship and do not rebel.
Question: If the following statements are true, all but one can weaken Aristotle ’s interpretation
Choices:
  A: City-state manufacturing has brought about the autonomy of citizens, and the monarchy has created the slavery of Shunmin.
  B: The difference in geographical environment has created the difference between the city-state system and the monarchy
  C: Aristotle's explanation is emotionally difficult for most Orientals to accept
  D: The difference between civilized people and barbarians is caused by different cultural and social organizations

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: European fern is a poisonous wild grass that has spread and destroyed many pastures in the northern hemisphere in recent years.One way to deal with this wild grass is to spend less money and be self-sustaining by introducing the natural enemy of this plant.Therefore, some scientists suggested that the moths that feed on the European fern produced in the southern hemisphere were released into the northern hemisphere affected by this wild grass to control the growth of the European fern.
Question: If the scientist ’s proposal to control the European fern is adopted, which of the following is necessary for its success?
Choices:
  A: This northern fern of the northern hemisphere also grows in areas with similar climate and soil conditions in the southern hemisphere.
  B: In addition to eating European ferns, the moths they stock also eat other wild grasses that grow in the northern hemisphere.
  C: The stocked moths can survive in the northern hemisphere and can form a large enough group to reduce the number of European ferns and prevent their growth.
  D: When the number of European ferns decreases, livestock will become immune to diseases caused by this wild grass.

Thought:
  If a soldier is aware of the danger of flying and submits an application to stop flying, it shows that his mind is clear and his spirit cannot be abnormal.
  Therefore, the statement "If a person can file an application to stop flying, it shows that his spirit cannot be abnormal" is the logical inference above.
  The answer is D: If a person can file an application to stop flying, it shows that his spirit cannot be abnormal.
Criticism:
  The logical inference above is not "If a person can realize that there is a danger of flying, it shows that he is mentally normal" as stated in option C.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: In a cooking competition, the chef is required to make one hot dish and one cold dish, and the results are evaluated as "top grade", "middle grade", and "bottom grade".If each result of the chef is not lower than that of Chef B, and at least one item is higher than Chef B, it is said that "Chef A is more skilled than Chef B".There are a number of existing chefs, none of them is more skilled than the other, and no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes.
Question: How many chefs can meet the above conditions?
Choices:
  A: unconfirmed
  B: 9 people
  C: 6 people
  D: 3 people
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Each chef must make one hot dish and one cold dish.
  - The results are evaluated as "top grade", "middle grade", and "bottom grade".

  - For each chef, there are 9 possible combinations of grades for the hot and cold dishes, so there are 9 x 9 = 81 possible combinations of grades for each chef.
  - If no chef is more skilled than another chef, then each chef must have a unique combination of grades.
  - Therefore, there can be at most 81 chefs (one for each possible combination of grades).
  - However, not all of these combinations are valid, since each chef must have a different combination of dishes.
  - There are 9 possible hot dishes and 9 possible cold dishes, so there are 9 x 9 = 81 possible combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  - Since each chef must have a unique combination of dishes, there can be at most 81 chefs.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Zhang Qiang? When the economy in a region is sluggish, many people are unemployed, so they reduce their living expenses, resulting in more unemployment and worsening the economy.The economy continued to deteriorate, and finally prices fell to the lowest point.Low prices have stimulated people to increase their living consumption, and increased consumption has led to improved economic conditions.Li Ming? If people are unemployed, they will not be able to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.Therefore, falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
Question: If the following statement is true, which one can best weaken Li Ming's rebuttal to Zhang Qiang?
Choices:
  A: After the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed.
  B: Even if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, consumers still believe that the economic situation will eventually improve.
  C: Even when the economy is extremely deteriorating, the unemployed must continue to buy necessities such as food.
  D: During the period of economic deterioration, even unemployed people will compress expenditures; when prices fall to the lowest point, they will have savings for consumption.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Zhang Qiang believes that a sluggish economy leads to unemployment, which leads to reduced living expenses, which leads to more unemployment and a worsening economy. However, when prices fall to the lowest point, people increase their living consumption, which leads to improved economic conditions.
  Li Ming believes that if people are unemployed, they will not be able to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life. Therefore, falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
Thought:
  Li Ming's argument is that unemployed people cannot increase their consumption, so falling prices will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
  To weaken this argument, we need to show that unemployed people can increase their consumption, even when prices are low.
  Option A talks about how reemployed people will buy goods that have been delayed, but it doesn't address the issue of unemployed people increasing their consumption.
  Option B talks about consumer beliefs, but it doesn't address the issue of unemployed people increasing their consumption.
  Option C says that the unemployed must continue to buy necessities such as food, but it doesn't address the issue of unemployed people increasing their consumption beyond necessities.
  Option D says that unemployed people will compress expenditures during economic deterioration, but when prices fall to the lowest point, they will have savings for consumption. This suggests that unemployed people can increase their consumption when prices are low.
  Therefore, Option D best weakens Li Ming's argument.

Topic: Logic
Context: The traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.There is no other explanation.The fiction says that the Eight Diagrams are named after the name of an object, For example, Qiangua is the heaven, and Qian is the ancient Chinese character, so it is named Qian; in the sense of meaning, the image of hexagrams represents the principle of things, and its rationality is taken as the name of a hexagram.The Lord is supple, so the hexagram is Kun, and Kun is the meaning of suppleness
Question: Which of the following statements is true, which most seriously shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name?
Choices:
  A: The reason why the two hexagrams of Qiankun ranks first among the sixty-four hexagrams is because the Qian gua represents heaven and the Kun gua represents earth.
  B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone.Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names
  C: Although there are many different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, it is inseparable from its sect, either attributed to the theory of fetching images, or attributed to the theory of fetching meanings

  A: Qian gua represents heaven and Kun gua represents earth.
  B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone. Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names.
  C: There are many different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, either attributed to the theory of fetching images or attributed to the theory of fetching meanings.
  D: The name of the hexagram comes from the account of the narration of the hexagram.
Thought:
  The question asks which statement most seriously shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.
  A: This statement does not shake the traditional view, as it only explains the reason why Qiankun ranks first among the sixty-four hexagrams.
  B: This statement suggests that the traditional view is incomplete and that both orientation theory and sense of meaning are necessary to explain the hexagram names. This could potentially shake the traditional view.
  C: This statement does not shake the traditional view, as it only suggests that there are different explanations for the origin of the Gua name.
  D: This statement does not shake the traditional view, as it only explains the origin of the name of one hexagram.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone. Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names.
Criticism:
  The answer is correct. There is no criticism.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Since 1993, sand and dust storms have frequently occurred in the Inner Mongolia region of our country, causing major economic losses.Some people think that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought.They are natural disasters, so they are inevitable.
Question: If the following items are true, can the above opinions be questioned, except?
Choices:
  A: In the 1950s, grass in Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia was as tall as a horse's belly, and now grass can't even cover mice.
  B: Opposite the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high.
  C: On the almost uninhabited border line of 10 kilometers wide between China and Mongolia, grass still maintains the height of the 1950s.
  D: The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Since the cancellation of mandatory pre-marriage inspections in City B in 2003, the pre-marriage inspection rate in the city has dropped from close to 100% 10 years ago to 7% in 2011, the lowest in the country.At the same time, the incidence of birth defects in the city has doubled.It can be seen that the abolition of the mandatory pre-marital inspection system has led to an increase in the rate of birth defects in newborns.
Question: The answers to the following questions are relevant to the evaluation of the above argument, except
Choices:
  A: Has the city's living environment (air and water quality, etc.) been damaged in the past decade?
  B: Have unhealthy lifestyles such as staying up late and online for a long time among the population of child-bearing age in this city increased significantly?
  C: Has women in this city delayed childbirth in the past decade, and has the proportion of older pregnant women increased significantly?
  D: Has the number of floating population in the city increased or decreased in the past decade?
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that the abolition of mandatory pre-marital inspection system has led to an increase in the rate of birth defects in newborns in City B.
  A: The living environment of the city is not directly related to the argument.
  B: Unhealthy lifestyles of the population of child-bearing age may be a factor that affects the incidence of birth defects, but it is not directly related to the argument.
  C: The age of pregnant women may be a factor that affects the incidence of birth defects, but it is not directly related to the argument.
  D: The number of floating population in the city is not directly related to the argument.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that the abolition of mandatory pre-marital inspection system has led to an increase in the rate of birth defects in newborns in City B.

  The proportion of the cost of buying commercial housing in the average family budget remained unchanged over the same period.
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that the proportion of all housing-related expenditures in each family budget remains unchanged.
  If the proportion of all housing-related expenditures in each family budget remained unchanged, then the increase in the average price of new commercial housing would have resulted in an increase in the average family budget.
  Therefore, the assumption upon which the above discussion relies is D: The proportion of all housing-related expenditures in each family budget remains unchanged.
Criticism: 
  None.

Topic: Logic
Context: The City Women's Federation conducted a questionnaire survey on 8,100 children aged 9 to 12 in the city.Statistics show that 75% of children are “willing to write homework”, and only 12% think that “writing homework occupies a lot of playing time”.Regarding these "good kids" answers, one parent's opinion is? either the children did not tell the truth, or their playful nature has been distorted.
Question: Which of the following statements is the hypothesis on which this parent ’s inference relies?
Choices:
  A: If the children can tell the truth, not so many children will express "willing to write homework", and very few children think that "writing homework squeezes out the time of playing."
  B: Under the education of school and family, the children have recognized the psychological orientation of "good students, good children", and they are not used to revealing their true ideas.
  C: Excessive learning pressure makes the children immersed in study all day, gradually getting used to the lack of entertainment life, thus losing the nature of playing.
  D: Compared with writing homework, children who love to play by nature prefer to play, and writing homework will definitely reduce their playing time.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Those who are in favor of the death penalty usually give two reasons? one is that the fear of death will prevent others from committing the same terrible crime; the other is that the death penalty saves more money than its alternative form of life imprisonment.However, reliable research shows that from an economic perspective, life imprisonment is more desirable.People think that saving money from capital punishment is not true.Therefore, the death penalty should be abolished.
Question: Logically, which of the following is an appropriate evaluation of the argument in the question?
Choices:
  A: The structure of this argument is acceptable because human life is more valuable than anything.
  B: This argument has logical power, because its reasons are true and human lives are crucial.
  C: The argument did not consider another important reason for the death penalty, so it is not a good argument.
  D: There is no need to discuss the abolition of the death penalty.

  The argument is logically sound because it presents evidence to support its claims and reaches a clear conclusion.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: This argument has logical power, because its reasons are true and human lives are crucial.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Politician? About four years ago, our party was committed to managing inflation from the beginning of its ruling and successfully reduced the increase in the consumer price index (CPI) from 4% at the time to 1.5% now.The opposition party's CPI rose by more than 4% during the previous four years in power.Therefore, under the leadership of our party, the prices of commodities are getting lower and lower.
Question: This politician's argument is most vulnerable to which of the following criticisms?
Choices:
  A: It did not elaborate on the opposition party ’s proposition, but simply ignored it.
  B: The evidence used to support this conclusion actually negates this conclusion and provides more support.
  C: It was not mentioned that the opposition party was in a period of overheating in the domestic economy, but now there is an economic crisis in Europe and the United States.
  D: There is no mention of the possibility that the opposition party has implemented a policy to combat inflation, but the effects of the policy will not be apparent until some time has passed.
Response 0:

  The politician claims that their party successfully reduced the increase in the consumer price index (CPI) from 4% to 1.5%.
  The opposition party's CPI rose by more than 4% during the previous four years in power.
Thought:
  The politician argues that their party has successfully managed inflation and lowered commodity prices.
  However, the argument is vulnerable to criticism because it does not consider other factors that may have contributed to the reduction in CPI, such as external economic conditions or policies implemented by the opposition party.
  Therefore, the most likely criticism is that the argument oversimplifies the issue and ignores other possible explanations for the reduction in CPI.
  Choice C suggests that external economic conditions may have played a role, but this is not necessarily a criticism of the argument.
  Choice D suggests that the opposition party may have implemented a policy to combat inflation, but this is also not necessarily a criticism of the argument.
  Choice A suggests that the argument ignored the opposition party's proposition, but this is not the most significant criticism.

  The politician argues that their party has successfully managed inflation and lowered commodity prices.
  However, the argument is vulnerable to criticism because it does not consider other factors that may have contributed to the reduction in CPI, such as external economic conditions or policies implemented by the opposition party.
  Therefore, the most likely criticism is that the argument oversimplifies the issue and ignores other possible explanations for the reduction in CPI.
  Choice C suggests that external economic conditions may have played a role, but this is not necessarily a criticism of the argument.
  Choice D suggests that the opposition party may have implemented a policy to combat inflation, but this is also not necessarily a criticism of the argument.
  Choice A suggests that the argument ignored the opposition party's proposition, but this is not the most significant criticism.
  Choice B suggests that the evidence used to support the conclusion actually negates the conclusion, which is a more significant criticism.
Criticism:
  The argument oversimplifies the issue and ignores other possible explanations for the reduction in CPI.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Since the Chinese delegation did not fully understand the rules of the Olympic Games, at the London Olympics, neither the criticism of the rules of the competition system nor the questioning of the referee ’s law enforcement, the appeals before and after failed several times.
Question: In order for the above reasoning to be true, which of the following must be added as a premise?
Choices:
  A: On the Olympic stage, China still has many things that it is not familiar with that need to be learned.
  B: Some delegations who thoroughly understand the rules of the Olympic Games have succeeded in appealing the rules and regulations of the competition.
  C: The delegations that succeeded in the complaints of the rules and regulations at the Olympic Games have thoroughly understood the rules of the Olympic Games.
  D: Delegations at the Olympic Games who thoroughly understand the rules of the Olympic Games can succeed in complaints about rules and regulations.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The Chinese delegation did not fully understand the rules of the Olympic Games.
  At the London Olympics, the Chinese delegation failed several times in their appeals due to their lack of understanding of the rules.
Thought:
  The reasoning suggests that the Chinese delegation's lack of understanding of the rules was the reason for their failed appeals.
  To make this reasoning true, we need to add a premise that connects the lack of understanding of the rules to the failed appeals.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about other delegations who succeeded in appealing the rules, which is not related to the Chinese delegation's situation.
  Option C is also irrelevant because it talks about delegations that succeeded in complaints, which is not related to the Chinese delegation's situation.
  Option D is also irrelevant because it talks about delegations that thoroughly understand the rules, which is not related to the Chinese delegation's situation.
  Option A is the only option that connects the lack of understanding of the rules to the failed appeals. If the Chinese delegation still has many things that they are not familiar with, then it is likely that they did not fully understand the rules of the Olympic Games, which led to their failed appeals.
Criticism:
  The reasoning assumes that the lack of understanding of the rules was the only reason for the failed appeals. There could be other factors that contributed to the failed appeals.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: The tragedy of gun violence in the United States has once again triggered discussions on gun control.Opponents of gun control claim that gun violence in the United States soared in the 1980s.In 1986, some states implemented strict gun control through legal means, but the average violent crime rate in those states that enforced strict gun control was the average violent crime rate in other states 1.5 times.It can be seen that strict gun control does not help reduce violent crime.
Question: If the following statement is true, which one weakens the above argument the strongest?
Choices:
  A: Since 1986, the proportion of American households with guns has declined significantly.
  B: Since 1986, the annual number of violent crimes in these states that have imposed strict gun control has continued to decline.

Choices:
  A: Dr.Wang is responsible for treating at least one female patient.
  B: Dr.Wang is responsible for treating at least one child patient.
  C: Dr.Liu is responsible for treating at least one male patient.

Therefore, the remaining male patient (the one not assigned to Dr. Zhang) must be assigned to either Dr. Liu or Dr. Wang.
- If Dr. Wang is not assigned the remaining male patient, then he must be assigned 2 female patients. However, if Dr. Wang is assigned 2 female patients, then there will be no doctor available to treat the remaining male patient.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Researchers in a country reported that they found meteorites about 200 million years old in the strata of a certain area, and they were probably traces of flying objects when a huge meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada.The clay layer with a thickness of about 5 cm also contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are 50 to 2000 times the concentration normally found on the ground.In addition, this rock also contains special minerals in the formation of the late Bacques.Since the upper and lower strata also contain marine plankton fossils, it can be determined that the impact period was about 215 million years ago.
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best support the above research findings?
Choices:
  A: The rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground
  B: In the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale
  C: Elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface
  D: In ancient times, there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Professors? The United States, Canada and other countries have long enrolled masters and doctoral students in writing, and we are still calling for the right to award degrees in writing.This is a very different attitude towards applied and technical disciplines.Are we wrong, or are we wrong?
Question: Which of the following questions is most important to assess the rationality of the above argument?
Choices:
  A: If we are allowed to recruit masters and doctors in writing, how many people will apply for this major?
  B: Do we have the qualifications for the faculty and subject research in writing to recruit masters and doctors?
  C: Have we applied for masters and Ph.Ds in other applied and technical disciplines other than writing?
  D: Should we pay attention to the cultivation of master's degree and doctoral degree in applied and technical disciplines?
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the enrollment of masters and doctoral students in writing.
  The argument suggests that there is a different attitude towards writing compared to applied and technical disciplines.
Thought: 
  The argument is discussing the enrollment of masters and doctoral students in writing and questioning whether it is rational to do so.
  To assess the rationality of the argument, we need to ask a question that helps us evaluate the argument's premises and conclusion.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument's rationality because it does not address the argument's premises or conclusion.
  Option B is relevant because it addresses the qualifications of the faculty and subject research, which are important premises for the argument.
  Option C is not relevant to the argument's rationality because it does not address the argument's premises or conclusion.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: A fuel-efficient car of a certain brand sells for 270,000 yuan, while another ordinary one costs 170,000 yuan.According to the current gasoline prices and the test data of the fuel consumption of the two cars for 100 kilometers, people who buy this fuel-efficient car need to be at least 300,000 kilometers to make up for the higher price difference than buying ordinary cars.If the price of oil rises in the future, the mileage required to make up for the purchase price will increase accordingly.
Question: Which of the following statements most pointed out the shortcomings of the above argument?
Choices:
  A: Arguments and conclusions are contradictory
  B: The argument cannot fully support its conclusion
  C: The argument does not consider the possibility of future oil price reduction
  D: The argument uses unproven assumptions as an argument
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument compares the cost of a fuel-efficient car to an ordinary car based on their prices and fuel consumption.
  The argument states that it takes at least 300,000 kilometers to make up for the price difference between the two cars.
  The argument suggests that if the price of oil rises in the future, the mileage required to make up for the purchase price will increase accordingly.
Thought:
  The argument seems to be logically sound and does not contain any obvious contradictions.
  However, it is possible that the argument is incomplete and does not consider all relevant factors.
  For example, the argument assumes that the fuel-efficient car will maintain its fuel efficiency over time, but this may not be the case.
  Additionally, the argument does not consider the possibility of other costs associated with owning a car, such as maintenance and repair costs.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is B: The argument cannot fully support its conclusion.
Criticism:
  The argument is not contradictory, and it does support its conclusion to some extent.
  However, the argument is incomplete and does not consider all relevant factors, as mentioned in the thought process.
  Therefore, B: The argument cannot fully support its conclusion is the best answer.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Researchers have found that eating more than five servings of yam, corn, carrots, onions, or other similar vegetables every day can reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer.They surveyed 2,230 respondents, including 532 patients with pancreatic cancer, and then classified the agricultural products consumed by the cancer, and asked them about other lifestyle habits, such as overall diet and smoking, and compared it with 1701 other people.Compare living habits.It was found that people who ate at least five servings of vegetables per day were half as likely to develop pancreatic cancer as those who ate less than two servings of vegetables per day.
Question: Which of the following questions does not constitute a doubt about the reliability of the above research conclusion?
Choices:
  A: Are all the interviewees saying in the survey true?
  B: What is the proportion of men and women in patients with pancreatic cancer?
  C: Is there an important omission in the differences in living habits between patients with pancreatic cancer and non-pancreatic cancer involved in the investigation?
  D: Are there genetic causes for patients with pancreatic cancer?

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Medieval Arabs have many ancient Greek manuscripts.When needed, they translated them into Arabic.Medieval Arab philosophers were very interested in Aristotle ’s Poetics, which was obviously not shared by Arab poets, because a poet who was interested in Poetics must want to read Homer ’s poems, Aristotle himself often quotes Homer's poems.However, Homer's poems were not translated into Arabic until now.
Question: If the following statement is true, which one strongly supports the above argument?
Choices:
  A: There are some medieval Arabic translators who own the manuscripts of Homer poems in ancient Greek.
  B: Aristotle's "On Poetry" is often quoted and commented on by modern Arabic poets.
  C: Aristotle's "Poetry Theory" is mostly related to drama.Medieval Arabs also wrote dramas and performed them.
  D: Medieval Arabic series of stories, such as "The Night of the Arabs", are very similar to some parts of Homer's epic

  Medieval Arab philosophers were interested in Aristotle's Poetics.
  Aristotle often quotes Homer's poems.
  Homer's poems were not translated into Arabic until now.
Thought:
  The argument is that Arab poets were not interested in Aristotle's Poetics because they were not able to read Homer's poems, which were not translated into Arabic.
  Therefore, the statement that would strongly support this argument would be one that explains why Arab poets were not interested in Aristotle's Poetics.
  Option A talks about the existence of Homer's manuscripts in ancient Greek, but it does not explain why Arab poets were not interested in Aristotle's Poetics.
  Option B talks about modern Arabic poets, which is not relevant to the argument about medieval Arab poets.
  Option C talks about drama, which is related to Aristotle's Poetics, but it does not explain why Arab poets were not interested in Aristotle's Poetics.
  Option D talks about similarities between medieval Arabic stories and Homer's epic, but it does not explain why Arab poets were not interested in Aristotle's Poetics.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Sales experts believe that in a market that is no longer expanding, a company ’s best sales strategy is to pursue the largest market share, and the best way to achieve its goal is to do some comparative advertising that highlights the shortcomings of competitors.In the sluggish domestic milk powder market, A-brand milk powder and B-brand milk powder have been in a two-year comparative advertising campaign, accusing each other's products of causing harmful effects on the baby's health.However, these advertising campaigns did not increase their respective market shares, but instead made many people no longer buy any brand of domestically produced milk powder.
Question: Which of the following conclusions strongly supports the above statement?
Choices:
  A: Comparative advertising should not be used in an expanding or potentially expanding market.
  B: Comparative advertising runs the risk of shrinking their target market instead of expanding.
  C: Comparative advertising will not produce any long-term benefits unless consumers can easily judge the accuracy of those ads.
  D: If a company ’s products are significantly higher in quality than its competitors ’products, comparative advertising can increase the company ’s market share in any case.

  - The statement does not provide enough information to determine whether the squad leader's shooting performance is excellent or not.
  - The statement does not provide enough information to determine whether the shooting performance of the Sports Committee is excellent or not.

Response 6:
Knowledge:
  - The class fired live ammunition on the last day of military training.
  - Instructor Zhang said that no one in the class will have excellent shooting results because the military training time was too short.
  - Instructor Sun said that several people have trained before and their shooting performance will be excellent.
  - The third instructor said that the monitor or the sports commissioner can achieve excellent results.
Thought:
  - Only one of the three instructors was right.
  - If Instructor Zhang was right, then no one in the class will have excellent shooting results.
  - If Instructor Sun was right, then at least several people in the class will have excellent shooting results.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: A survey of traffic accidents has found that the incidence of traffic accidents is actually similar in cities where drunk driving is strictly investigated and those who do not.However, most experts believe that strict investigation of drunk driving can indeed reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents.
Question: Which of the following is most helpful in eliminating this inconsistency?
Choices:
  A: Severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.
  B: The city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving.
  C: It is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than strict management.
  D: In addition to strict investigation of drunk driving, other traffic violations should also be stopped.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: I can relate some external symbols to some inner events, for example, to associate moaning and face distortion with the feeling of pain.I learned from the pain experience that when I feel pain, I often moan and twist my face.Therefore, once I see that others have the same external signs, I take it for granted that they also have the same inner activity events as me.After all, between me and others, the behavior and normal physiological functions are obviously similar.Why aren't they similar in inner activities?
Question: Which of the following can most strongly support the above argument?
Choices:
  A: Similar results must have similar reasons.
  B: There may be a close connection between pain and moaning and face twisting.
  C: There may be an intrinsic relationship between behavior and inner activities.
  D: People are similar in many ways.
Response 0:

Knowledge:
  There are six general manager assistants: F, G, H, I, M, and P.
  There are three departments, each of which is in charge of three general manager assistants.
  Each assistant general manager is in charge of at least one department.
  There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  F and G are not in charge of the same department.
  H and I are not in charge of the same department.
Thought:
  If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are each in charge of one of the three departments.
  There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time, so neither F nor M can be that assistant.
  Therefore, the assistant in charge of three departments must be one of G, H, I, or P.
  F is not in charge of the same department as G, so F cannot be in charge of the same department as the assistant in charge of three departments.
  Therefore, F must be in charge of a department with either H or I.
  If F is in charge of a department with H, then I cannot be in charge of the same department as H, which violates the condition that each assistant general manager is in charge of at least one department.
  Therefore, F must be in charge of a department with I.
  This means that H and G are in charge of the remaining department.
  Therefore, M and G are not in charge of the same department.
  The only option that must be true is D: M and G are not in charge of the same department.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: twenty two.WiFi transmitters generate electromagnetic radiation.Five Danish middle school students put cress seeds in a room with a WiFi transmitter and without a WiFi transmitter for cultivation.After 12 days, they found that the germination rate of the seeds in the room without a WiFi transmitter was 95.4%, with WiFi transmission The germination rate of seeds in the machine room was 85.3%.Many people worry that WiFi radiation will affect human health.However, many experts believe that the above experiment is not rigorous, and it cannot be concluded that WiFi radiation is harmful to humans.
Question: Which of the following assertions can support the opinions of these experts?
Choices:
  A: The impact of WiFi radiation on the human body is related not only to its frequency, but also to the distance between the WiFi transmitter and the human body.
  B: Keep other conditions unchanged in the same room, and repeat the experiment with and without a WiFi transmitter.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: The lower the credit rating of the borrower, the higher the cost of borrowing and the higher the rate of return for the creditor.On August 5, 2011, S & P downgraded the US sovereign credit rating from AAA to AA +.According to common sense, investors should reduce their holdings of U.S.Treasury bonds when they are in a safe haven, thereby pushing their prices down and yields rising.However, on August 8, the price of US Treasury bonds rose, and the yield fell, and the yield of the latest 10-year US Treasury bond fell to 2.34%, a new low this year.
Question: If any of the following statements are true, can we best explain the above-mentioned violation of common sense?
Choices:
  A: On the evening of August 5, the US Treasury responded that S & P had a $ 2 trillion error in its rating calculations.
  B: Compared with the bonds of the European Union, Japan and other countries, US Treasuries are still relatively safe and liquid investment products.
  C: After the US sovereign credit rating was lowered, Russia began to reduce its holdings of US Treasury bonds, while China still increased its holdings of US Treasury bonds.
  D: In order to break the monopoly of three US rating agencies including S & P, the EU plans to establish a European credit rating agency.

  Lower credit rating of the borrower leads to higher cost of borrowing and higher rate of return for the creditor.
  On August 5, 2011, S&P downgraded the US sovereign credit rating from AAA to AA+.
  Common sense suggests that investors should reduce their holdings of US Treasury bonds when they are in a safe haven, thereby pushing their prices down and yields rising.
  On August 8, the price of US Treasury bonds rose, and the yield fell, and the yield of the latest 10-year US Treasury bond fell to 2.34%, a new low this year.
Thought: 
  The downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating should have led to a decrease in demand for US Treasury bonds, which should have led to a decrease in their prices and an increase in their yields.
  However, the price of US Treasury bonds rose, and the yield fell, which is a violation of common sense.
  Option A does not provide a clear explanation for the violation of common sense.
  Option B suggests that US Treasuries are still relatively safe and liquid investment products compared to bonds of other countries, which could explain why investors still prefer to hold US Treasury bonds despite the downgrade.
  Option C suggests that China still increased its holdings of US Treasury bonds, which could explain why the price of US Treasury bonds rose despite the downgrade.
  Option D does not provide a clear explanation for the violation of common sense.
  Therefore, the best explanation for the above-mentioned violation of common sense is option B: Compared with the bonds of the European Union, Japan and other countries, US Treasuries are still relatively safe and liquid investment products. 
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Homo erectus originated in Africa about 2 million years ago and spread to Eurasia; modern people appeared about 200,000 years ago.Both human fossils are distributed in China.For example, the "Beijing people" unearthed in the ancient stratum of Zhoukoudian, Beijing belonged to Homo erectus; the "shandingdong people" in the stratum of the previous year belonged to modern people.A study of the contemporary Chinese population found that the Y chromosome inherited from the paternal lineage originated in Africa and originated in 8.9 10,000 years to 35,000 years ago; the mitochondrial DNA inherited from the maternal line originated in Africa, with a time of origin within 100,000 years; no genetic component of H.erectus was detected

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Huan Gong? "Why do few people read the dross of the ancients?" Lu Pian? "According to my experience, when the wheels are made, the wheel holes are slightly larger and loose and not firm, and when they are small, they are difficult to enter.If you want to do something that is not too big, not too loose, you have to give it to your heart and give it to your hand.There is superb technology in it, but it ca n’t be conveyed in words, I ca n’t teach my son, so, I When you are seventy years old, you have to take a turn.The ancients are dead, and the essence they ca n’t tell is also followed by hours.Then what you are reading is the dross of the ancients."
Question: Which of the following statements is the hypothesis on which Lu Bian ’s argument relies?
Choices:
  A: In addition to the essence and dross, there are other contents worth reading
  B: If the essence cannot be spoken, reading is not only useless but harmful
  C: Superb technology cannot be taught to others through language
  D: In addition to superb technology, other essences are also unspeakable
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Lu Pian argues that the essence of the ancients cannot be conveyed in words.
  A: This statement is not relevant to Lu Pian's argument.
  B: This statement is not the hypothesis on which Lu Pian's argument relies.
  C: This statement is the hypothesis on which Lu Pian's argument relies.
  D: This statement is not the hypothesis on which Lu Pian's argument relies.
Thought:
  Lu Pian argues that the essence of the ancients cannot be conveyed in words.
  He uses the example of making wheels to illustrate that some things require hands-on experience to understand.
  Therefore, he believes that the essence of the ancients cannot be learned through reading alone.
  This is the hypothesis on which his argument relies.
  The hypothesis is that superb technology cannot be taught to others through language.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Superb technology cannot be taught to others through language.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct.
  However, it is important to note that Lu Pian's argument is not about all knowledge, but specifically about the essence of the ancients.
  Additionally, the statement "Superb technology cannot be taught to others through language" is not a direct quote from Lu Pian, but rather a paraphrase of his argument.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: When the number of cod in the North Atlantic Ocean decreased significantly, the number of seals increased from 1.5 million to about 2.5 million.Some people think that seals have caused a decrease in cod, but seals rarely eat cod, so it is unlikely that a large increase in the number of seals caused a significant decline in the number of cod.
Question: Which of the following statements, if true, can weaken the argument most strongly?
Choices:
  A: In the traditional cod fishing belt, a large number of seals caused great inconvenience to the fishing boat.
  B: The damage caused by seawater pollution to cod is more serious than that caused to seals.
  C: Before the number of seals increased, the number of cod in the North Atlantic Ocean was greatly reduced.
  D: Cod almost only eat capelin, and this fish is also the main food for seals.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that seals rarely eat cod, so it is unlikely that a large increase in the number of seals caused a significant decline in the number of cod.
  A: This statement is about the inconvenience caused by seals to fishing boats, but it does not provide any information about whether seals eat cod or not.
  B: This statement is about seawater pollution, but it does not provide any information about whether seals eat cod or not.
  C: This statement suggests that the number of cod was already greatly reduced before the number of seals increased, which could weaken the argument that seals did not cause the decline in cod.
  D: This statement suggests that cod and seals both eat capelin, which could weaken the argument that seals did not cause the decline in cod.
Thought:
  The argument is that seals rarely eat cod, so it is unlikely that a large increase in the number of seals caused a significant decline in the number of cod.
  Statement C suggests that the number of cod was already greatly reduced before the number of seals increased, which could weaken the argument that seals did not cause the decline in cod.
  Statement D suggests that cod and seals both eat capelin, which could weaken the argument that seals did not cause the decline in cod.
  Statement A and B do not provide any information about whether seals eat cod or not, so they do not weaken the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or D.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct. Both C and D could weaken the argument. However, statement D is not strong enough to weaken the argument most strongly. Statement C is stronger because it suggests that the decline in cod was already happening before the increase in seals, which could indicate that seals were not the main cause of the decline in cod.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: This summer, the extremely high temperature and drought hit Chongqing and Sichuan, including the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River, nearly one million square kilometers.Some people said on the Internet that the construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir caused the high temperature and drought in this area, and it is difficult to reverse.
Question: If the following items are true, you can question the above points, except?
Choices:
  A: The hot and dry weather encountered in Chongqing and Sichuan this year is the worst in 50 years in terms of the scope and duration of the impact.
  B: Simulation studies have shown that the water range of the Three Gorges Reservoir area has an impact on climate of about 20 kilometers.
  C: This year, the relatively high water temperature in the western Pacific has caused the subtropical high pressure to be more northerly and more westward than in previous years.At the same time, the cold air in the north is weaker, resulting in reduced precipitation in Chongqing and Sichuan.
  D: From winter to spring, the snowfall on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is 20% less than normal, resulting in a significant plateau thermal effect and reduced water vapor output.

  C: This year, the relatively high water temperature in the western Pacific has caused the subtropical high pressure to be more northerly and more westward than in previous years. At the same time, the cold air in the north is weaker, resulting in reduced precipitation in Chongqing and Sichuan.
  D: From winter to spring, the snowfall on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is 20% less than normal, resulting in a significant plateau thermal effect and reduced water vapor output.
Thought:
  A: If the hot and dry weather encountered in Chongqing and Sichuan this year is the worst in 50 years, it is possible that the Three Gorges Reservoir is not the only cause of the high temperature and drought.
  B: If simulation studies have shown that the water range of the Three Gorges Reservoir area has an impact on climate of about 20 kilometers, it is possible that the Three Gorges Reservoir has contributed to the high temperature and drought in Chongqing and Sichuan.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Crimes involving the use of firearms are more likely to lead to murder than other types of crimes.However, most crimes involving the use of firearms did not result in homicides.Therefore, there is no need to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense in the criminal law from other criminal offenses.
Question: The logic loophole in the above argument is most similar to the following one?
Choices:
  A: Obese people are more likely to suffer from heart disease than people with normal weight.However, obese people make up a very small percentage of our population.Therefore, in our country, there is no need for the medical and health community to emphasize the risk of heart disease.
  B: Unchecked sex is more likely to be infected with AIDS than checkpoint.However, among people with unchecked sex, only a small percentage of people are infected with AIDS.Therefore, there is no need to emphasize the harm of unchecked sex in the propaganda of AIDS prevention.
  C: The prevailing view is that smoking is more likely to cause lung cancer than not smoking.However, in some countries, the proportion of people with lung cancer who have a history of smoking is not higher than the proportion of the total population who have a history of smoking.Therefore, the above popular opinion is likely to be a prejudice.
  D: High-income people are more capable of enjoying life than low-income people.But there are many high-income earners who claim to be unhappy.Therefore, those who pursue a happy life need not pay attention to the level of income.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that crimes involving firearms are more likely to lead to murder than other types of crimes.
  However, most crimes involving firearms did not result in homicides.
  The conclusion is that there is no need to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense in the criminal law from other criminal offenses.
Thought: 
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that just because most crimes involving firearms did not result in homicides, there is no need to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense.
  This is a logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy, where the argument presents only two options and assumes that they are the only ones available.
  In this case, the argument assumes that the only options are to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense or to treat it the same as other criminal offenses.
  However, there may be other options, such as distinguishing the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense but with different penalties than for homicide.
  Therefore, the logic loophole in the argument is most similar to option C, where the argument assumes a popular opinion is a prejudice without considering other factors that may affect the relationship between smoking and lung cancer.
Action: Answer("C")

  In this case, the argument assumes that the only options are to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense or to treat it the same as other criminal offenses.
  However, there may be other options, such as distinguishing the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense but with different penalties than for homicide.
  Therefore, the logic loophole in the argument is most similar to option C, where the argument assumes a popular opinion is a prejudice without considering other factors that may affect the relationship between smoking and lung cancer.
Action: Answer("C")

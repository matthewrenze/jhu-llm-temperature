Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.

Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Five students: Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill.
  - Three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
  - Each student reviews one or more of the three plays.
  - Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
  - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  - Exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other.
Thoughts:
  - If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can review Undulation.
  - Therefore, Megregian must be the only one who reviews Undulation.
  - According to the conditions, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  - This means that Jiang must review either Sunset or Tamerlane.
  - Since exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other, the other two students must review the same play.
  - If Jiang reviews Tamerlane, then the other two students who review Tamerlane are Kramer and O'Neill, but this violates the condition that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  - Therefore, Jiang must review Sunset, and the other two students who review Sunset are the ones who review the same play as each other.
  - This means that Lopez and Megregian both review Sunset, and neither of them can review Undulation.
  - So, O'Neill must review Undulation.

Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Thought: 
  A 1-day website target can be set for Image, Solide, or Truvest.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for Image, Solide, or Truvest.
  A 2-day website target cannot be set for Solide because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for Image, Solide, or Truvest.
  A 3-day website target can be set for Image, Solide, or Truvest.
  Therefore, the answer is C: a 2-day website target.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.
  However, you missed that a 1-day voicemail target can also only be set for one client, as Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building

Thought: 
  RealProp has a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  To make a trade, each company must trade one of their buildings for another building of the same class, or trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must trade the Flores Tower for two class 3 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade one of their class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp can trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings or trade one of their class 3 buildings for another class 3 building.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings, then Trustcorp must trade the King Building for two class 3 buildings, and RealProp must trade one of their class 3 buildings for another class 3 building.
  If RealProp trades one of their class 3 buildings for another class 3 building, then Trustcorp must trade one of their class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, and RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the possible buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made are:
    RealProp: the Garza Tower and two class 2 buildings

Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.

  - U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Thought:
  - If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  - T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  - If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and X must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  - S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
  - If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  - If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.
  - If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  - Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  - If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4, which is already assigned to U.

Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?

  Therefore, Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 and Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3 and Young must be assigned parking space #4, #5, or #6.
  Based on the above deductions, we can eliminate options A, B, and E.
  Option C assigns Togowa to parking space #1, which violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Option D assigns Robertson to parking space #2, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1923.
  B: Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following is an acceptable assignment of photographers to the two graduation ceremonies?
Choices:
  A: Silva University: Gonzalez, Lai Thorne University: Frost, Heideck, Mays
  B: Silva University: Gonzalez, Mays Thorne University: Knutson, Lai
  C: Silva University: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck Thorne University: Knutson, Lai, Mays

  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  We can start by assigning Frost and Heideck to Thorne University ceremony.
  Then, we can assign Knutson to Thorne University ceremony.
  Since Knutson is assigned to Thorne University ceremony, both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  Therefore, we can assign Mays to Thorne University ceremony.
  Now, we can assign Gonzalez to Silva University ceremony.
  Since Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University ceremony, Lai must be assigned to Thorne University ceremony.
  Therefore, we can assign Lai to Thorne University ceremony.
  We have assigned 5 photographers so far.
  We can assign the last photographer, which is either Frost or Gonzalez, to Silva University ceremony.
  Therefore, the acceptable assignment of photographers to the two graduation ceremonies is:
  Silva University: Gonzalez, Lai
  Thorne University: Frost, Heideck, Knutson, Mays
  The answer is D: Silva University: Gonzalez, Lai Thorne University: Frost, Heideck, Mays
Criticism: 
  There are no flaws in the logic used to arrive at the answer.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.

  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Tiao, then there would be two sales representatives in Zone 2, which would contradict the fact that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  The answer is D: Tiao.
Criticism: 
  Your logic is correct.
  However, it is also possible that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall, since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the correct answer is either D: Tiao or E: Udall.

Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of lab assistants any one of whom could lead the Thursday afternoon session?
Choices:
  A: Julio, Nessa
  B: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:

  2. The accomplices were recruited one at a time.
  3. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  4. Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  5. Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  6. Peters was recruited fourth.
Thought:
  1. If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is: Peters, X, Y, Quinn, Rovero, Z, White.
  2. Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the accomplices is: W, X, Y, Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Z.
  3. Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of the accomplices is: W, X, Y, Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  4. Quinn was recruited before Rovero, so the order of the accomplices is: W, X, Y, Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  5. If Stanton was recruited immediately before or after Tao, then the order of the accomplices is: W, X, Y, Peters, Quinn, Stanton/Tao, Rovero, Villas, White.
  6. However, Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  7. Therefore, Stanton cannot have been recruited immediately before or after Rovero.
  8. If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited fifth.

Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.

  - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player, so the percussionist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  - The percussionist cannot perform the first solo because the violinist performs before the keyboard player.
  - The percussionist cannot perform the second solo because the saxophonist performs after the trumpeter.
  - Therefore, the percussionist must perform the third solo.
  - The violinist performs before the keyboard player, so the violinist must perform the first solo.
  - The saxophonist performs after the trumpeter, so the saxophonist must perform the sixth solo.
  - The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, so the keyboard player must perform the fifth solo.
  - Therefore, the answer is C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.

  According to condition 7, Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 3.
  Therefore, the only option that could also be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil, which must be displayed with Hidalgo's oil.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
- There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.

- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Thought:
- From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, the remaining sales representative (who is not Parra, Tiao, or Udall) must work in Zone 3.
- We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, so if Udall is in Zone 2, then Stuckey must also be in Zone 2, which would contradict the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Udall must be in Zone 3.
- If Udall is in Zone 3, then the remaining sales representatives in Zone 3 must be those who are not Parra, Tiao, Udall, Stuckey, or Quinn. That leaves Kim and Mahr.
- Therefore, a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 could be Kim and Mahr.
- Option A (Kim, Mahr) could be correct.
- Option B (Kim, Tiao) is not possible because Tiao is already assigned to a sales zone (either Zone 1 or Zone 2).

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Veqemite performs in slot three, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon
  C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy
  D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than, wellspring
  E: Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon—will perform in six slots numbered one through six.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Thought: 
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in a later slot than Vegemite, which means Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, which means Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, which means Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, which means Yardsign must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so A is false.
  Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, so B is true.
  Xpert must perform in slot six, so C is false.
  Yardsign can perform in slot three, so D is false.
  Zircon must perform in a later slot than Uneasy, so E is false.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.

  - We know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is not.
  - We know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so neither O nor L can be on the bottom shelf if the other is not.
  - We know that F is on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  - If G, H, or I are on the bottom shelf, then there would be fewer books on the bottom shelf than the middle shelf, which is not allowed.
  - If K or O are on the bottom shelf, then there would be fewer books on the bottom shelf than the middle shelf, which is not allowed.
  - Therefore, the only possible combination of books on the bottom shelf is F, H, and M.
  - This is because F and M must be together, and H is the only remaining book that can be on the bottom shelf without violating any of the conditions.

  - If K or O are on the bottom shelf, then there would be fewer books on the bottom shelf than the middle shelf, which is not allowed.
  - Therefore, the only possible combination of books on the bottom shelf is F, H, and M.
  - This is because F and M must be together, and H is the only remaining book that can be on the bottom shelf without violating any of the conditions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - There are 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
  - There are 3 shelves: top, middle, and bottom.
  - Each shelf has at least 2 books.
  - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is on the middle shelf.
  - K is on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.
Thoughts:
  - We know that I is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  - We know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is not.
  - We know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so neither O nor L can be on the bottom shelf if the other is not.
  - We know that F is on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  - If G, H, or I are on the bottom shelf, then there would be fewer books on the bottom shelf than the middle shelf, which is not allowed.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:

Thought:
  - The given condition is: If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  - This means that if M is not published in the fall, then N can be published in either fall or spring.
  - Therefore, we need a new condition that has the same effect, i.e., restricts the publication of N to only one season based on the publication of another cookbook.
  - Option A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This condition does not affect the publication of N.
  - Option B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This condition affects the publication of P, not N.
  - Option C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This condition affects the publication of P, not N.
  - Option D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This condition affects the publication of M, not N.
  - Option E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This condition affects the publication of N, but not based on the publication of M.
  - Therefore, none of the given options have the same effect as the given condition.
Criticism:
  - The given condition is unique and cannot be substituted by any of the given options.
  - The question is flawed as it asks for a substitution that does not exist.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor

Thought:
- Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither of their paintings can be on wall 1.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so Franz's watercolor cannot be on wall 1.
- Hidalgo's oil cannot be on wall 1 because then wall 1 would have the work of only one student displayed on it.
- Therefore, the only option left is that Greene's oil must be on wall 1.

Thought:
- Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither of their paintings can be on wall 1.
- Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so Franz's watercolor cannot be on wall 1.
- Hidalgo's oil cannot be on wall 1 because then wall 1 would have the work of only one student displayed on it.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Exactly three workers will be selected for the project.
  Exactly one of the selected workers will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if they are the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Thought:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor must not be selected. 
  This means that only three workers are left to choose from: Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  If Ruiz is selected, then he must be the project leader, and Verma and Wells cannot be selected.
  If Verma is selected, then she cannot be a project member, and neither can Ruiz or Wells.
  If Wells is selected, then he cannot be a project member, and neither can Ruiz or Verma.
  If Xue is selected, then Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, and the other one must be a project member. The third member can be any of the remaining workers.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
  The answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Criticism:
  Your logic is correct. If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the selection for the project is completely determined. 
  However, you did not consider the possibility that Xue could be selected, which would also determine the selection for the project.
  If Xue is selected, then Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader, and the other one must be a project member. The third member can be any of the remaining workers.
  Therefore, the correct answer is either D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected or E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
- There are 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Thought:
- If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Stuckey and Udall must also work in that same sales zone.
- Therefore, there are at least 3 sales representatives in that sales zone.
- Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, the sales zone where Mahr and Stuckey work must be either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
- If the sales zone where Mahr and Stuckey work is Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao (but not both) must also work in Zone 1. However, if Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 2, which is not possible. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 3.
- If the sales zone where Mahr and Stuckey work is Zone 3, then there must be at least 4 sales representatives in Zone 3. Since Parra and Tiao are already assigned to Zone 1 and Zone 3, respectively, the remaining sales representatives in Zone 3 are Kim, Quinn, and Udall. Therefore, Mahr cannot work in Zone 3.
- The only possible scenario is that Mahr works in Zone 1.

- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Thought:
- If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Stuckey and Udall must also work in that same sales zone.
- Therefore, there are at least 3 sales representatives in that sales zone.
- Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, the sales zone where Mahr and Stuckey work must be either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
- If the sales zone where Mahr and Stuckey work is Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao (but not both) must also work in Zone 1. However, if Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 2, which is not possible. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 3.
- If the sales zone where Mahr and Stuckey work is Zone 3, then there must be at least 4 sales representatives in Zone 3. Since Parra and Tiao are already assigned to Zone 1 and Zone 3, respectively, the remaining sales representatives in Zone 3 are Kim, Quinn, and Udall. Therefore, Mahr cannot work in Zone 3.
- The only possible scenario is that Mahr works in Zone 1.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.

  - If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. This means that the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. This means that the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th.

  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays

Thought:
  We need to find a complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  We can start by eliminating options that do not meet the constraints.
  Option A: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, but Knutson is also assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which violates the constraint that no photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. So, option A is not valid.
  Option B: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, and Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which means Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. This leaves only one photographer to be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which is within the constraints. So, option B is valid.
  Option C: Knutson is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, but Heideck and Mays must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony if Knutson is not assigned to it. So, option C is not valid.
  Option D: Heideck is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, but Lai and Mays must be assigned to different ceremonies if both are assigned. So, option D is not valid.
  Option E: Knutson is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, but Heideck and Mays must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony if Knutson is not assigned to it. So, option E is not valid.
  Therefore, the only valid option is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?

  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.

  Since J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, then J must be either first or second.
  If J is first, then G must be second, and the order of the first three articles would be J, G, and Q, which violates the condition that S must be earlier than Q.

Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- There are seven articles to be edited: G, H, J, Q, R, S, and Y.

- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
- S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
- S must be earlier than Y.
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

Thought:
- If H is fourth, then the order of the nutrition articles must be Q, S, R. Then, the order of the finance articles must be J, G, H. Finally, Y must be last. This order satisfies all the conditions, so the answer could be A.
- If H is sixth, then the order of the nutrition articles must be Q, S, R. Then, the order of the finance articles must be G, J, H. However, this violates the condition that J must be earlier than G, so this cannot be the answer.
- If R is fourth, then the order of the nutrition articles must be S, Q, R. Then, the order of the finance articles must be J, G, H. Finally, Y must be last. This order satisfies all the conditions, so the answer could be C.
- If R is seventh, then Y must be fifth and the order of the nutrition articles must be S, Q, R. Then, the order of the finance articles must be J, G, H. This order satisfies all the conditions, so the answer could be D.

Criticism:
- The thought process is correct for all options except for A and C.
- For option A, the order of the nutrition articles could be Q, R, S instead of Q, S, R. This would still satisfy the conditions and make H fourth.

- If Y is fifth, then the order of the nutrition articles must be S, Q, R. Then, the order of the finance articles must be J, G, H. Finally, Y must be fifth. However, this violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y, so this cannot be the answer.

Criticism:
- The thought process is correct for all options except for A and C.
- For option A, the order of the nutrition articles could be Q, R, S instead of Q, S, R. This would still satisfy the conditions and make H fourth.
- For option C, the order of the finance articles could be G, H, J instead of J, G, H. This would still satisfy the conditions and make R fourth.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - There are six antiques to be auctioned: harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial, table, and vase.
  - The auctions will take place over six consecutive days: June 1st through June 6th.
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
Thought:
  - If the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
  - If the mirror and vase are auctioned on June 1st and 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd, which means the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th or later.
  - This violates the condition that the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp if the mirror is auctioned before the lamp.
  - Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 4th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or 6th, then the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
  - If the mirror and vase are auctioned on June 1st and 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd, which means the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th or later.
  - This satisfies the condition that the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp if the mirror is auctioned before the lamp.
  - Therefore, the table could be auctioned on June 5th or 6th.
  - If the table is auctioned on June 5th or 6th, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
  - If the sundial is auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, then the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 3rd or later, which violates the condition that the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and vase.
  - Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 3rd.
  - This means the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th.
  - This satisfies all of the conditions.
  - Therefore, the answer is B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Criticism:
  - There are no flaws in the logic or reasoning.
  - The answer is correct.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.

Knowledge:
- Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread.
- Six colors of thread are available: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
- Exactly five of the six colors will be used to weave the rugs.
- Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
- The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
- In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
- In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
- Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
- Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
- Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Thought:
- We know that exactly five colors will be used to weave the rugs, so one color will not be used.
- We also know that each color will be used in only one of the rugs.
- If we look at the rules, we can see that there are some color combinations that are not allowed in a rug.
- We can start by eliminating the colors that cannot be used together in a rug: forest and turquoise, peach and turquoise, and peach and yellow.
- From the rule that states that in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used, we can infer that white will be used in a multicolored rug.
- From the rule that states that in any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used, we can infer that olive and peach will be used together in a rug.
- We can also infer that the rug with olive and peach cannot be the same rug that has white, since white requires two other colors to be used.
- Therefore, we know that there are at least two multicolored rugs.
- We can eliminate choices A and B because they make assumptions about the use of forest and turquoise that are not necessarily true.
- We can eliminate choice E because we do not know if yellow will be used in any of the rugs.
- We are left with choice C and choice D.
- We know that peach will be used in a rug because it is used with olive, so choice C must be true.
- We do not know if turquoise will be used in a rug, so choice D may or may not be true.

Criticism:
- The thought process is correct, but it is important to note that we cannot be certain that turquoise will be used in a rug, so choice D is not necessarily true.

- In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
- In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
- Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
- Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
- Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Thought:
- We know that exactly five colors will be used to weave the rugs, so one color will not be used.
- We also know that each color will be used in only one of the rugs.
- If we look at the rules, we can see that there are some color combinations that are not allowed in a rug.
- We can start by eliminating the colors that cannot be used together in a rug: forest and turquoise, peach and turquoise, and peach and yellow.
- From the rule that states that in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used, we can infer that white will be used in a multicolored rug.
- From the rule that states that in any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used, we can infer that olive and peach will be used together in a rug.
- We can also infer that the rug with olive and peach cannot be the same rug that has white, since white requires two other colors to be used.
- Therefore, we know that there are at least two multicolored rugs.
- We can eliminate choices A and B because they make assumptions about the use of forest and turquoise that are not necessarily true.
- We can eliminate choice E because we do not know if yellow will be used in any of the rugs.
- We are left with choice C and choice D.
- We know that peach will be used in a rug because it is used with olive, so choice C must be true.
- We do not know if turquoise will be used in a rug, so choice D may or may not be true.

Criticism:
- The thought process is correct, but it is important to note that we cannot be certain that turquoise will be used in a rug, so choice D is not necessarily true.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.

Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  - Eight compositions are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time.
  - The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions:
    - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
    - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
    - O is performed either first or fifth.
    - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
    - P is performed at some time before S.
    - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.

  - If S is performed fourth, then O cannot be performed first because O must be performed either first or fifth.
  - If O is performed fifth, then F and R must be performed either second and third or sixth and seventh.
  - If T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed after F and before S.
  - If H or L is performed last, then P must be performed before S and after O.
  - If P is performed before S, then P cannot be performed last.
  - From the above conditions, we can deduce that the order of the compositions must be O, P, T, F, R, S, H/L.

Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: Verma could be the project leader if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.

  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be one of the first two auditions.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be one of the first four auditions.
  Therefore, the only possible order of auditions is: Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida.
  The sixth audition must be Yoshida's audition.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, or E, but D: Waite's audition.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the order of auditions must be: Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida.
  However, the question asks which one of the following could be the sixth audition, not which one must be the sixth audition.

One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.

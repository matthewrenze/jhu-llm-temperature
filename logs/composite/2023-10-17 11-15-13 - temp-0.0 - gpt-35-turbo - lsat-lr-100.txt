### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than those who do not.
Thought:
  The argument assumes that watching television is the only factor that influences people's perception of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that there are other factors that influence people's perception of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
  A: This answer choice does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  B: This answer choice suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters, which weakens the argument.
  C: This answer choice suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster, which does not weaken the argument.
  D: This answer choice suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, which weakens the argument.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals indicates that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  A: Many university libraries charging higher fines for overdue books and periodicals does not directly relate to the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
  B: The fact that a university library's acquisition budget represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget does not directly relate to the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
  C: The argument assumes that publishers of scholarly journals are consistently profitable, but this option suggests that they may not be.
  D: This option suggests that the subscription rates for individuals have not increased, which weakens the argument that publishing a scholarly journal is more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  E: The frequency of publication of scholarly journals does not directly relate to the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
Thought: 
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals indicates that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  Option C suggests that publishers of scholarly journals may not be consistently profitable, which weakens the argument.
  Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychologist: Doctors should never prescribe sedatives for people with insomnia. Most cases of insomnia that psychologists treat are known to be caused by psychological stress. This suggests that insomniacs do not need drugs that alter their biochemistry, but rather need psychotherapy to help them alleviate the stress causing their insomnia.
Question: Each of the following describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: It presumes, without providing warrant, that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress.
  B: It fails to consider the possibility that sedatives are the only treatment known to be effective for cases of insomnia not caused by stress.
  C: It neglects the possibility that for some people psychotherapy is a completely ineffective treatment for stress.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress.
  E: It presumes, without providing justification, that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
- The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
- The hospitals' staffs became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties due to the knowledge that their errors were being monitored.

Thought:
- The argument is that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
- To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports this claim.

Evaluation:
- (A) is irrelevant to the argument and does not provide any additional support.
- (B) weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be solely due to the implementation of the plan.
- (C) weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to capture all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
- (D) strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries is indeed due to the implementation of the plan, as the staff became more careful only after they became aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
- (E) is irrelevant to the argument and does not provide any additional support.

Action: Answer("D")

Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
- The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
- The hospitals' staffs became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties due to the knowledge that their errors were being monitored.

Thought:
- The argument is that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
- To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports this claim.

Evaluation:
- (A) is irrelevant to the argument and does not provide any additional support.
- (B) weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be solely due to the implementation of the plan.
- (C) weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to capture all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
- (D) strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries is indeed due to the implementation of the plan, as the staff became more careful only after they became aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
- (E) is irrelevant to the argument and does not provide any additional support.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether
Choices:
  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile
  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile
  D: there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.

  However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  Therefore, there must be some other factors that caused the increase in average commute time.
  Option A suggests that most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs. This means that the new highway may have attracted more people to live in the suburbs, which in turn increased the number of people commuting to downtown Gastner. This could explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option B suggests that the location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs. This means that the new highway may have attracted more people to live in the largest suburbs, which in turn increased the number of people commuting to downtown Gastner. This could also explain the increase in average commute time.
  Option C suggests that several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights. This may have slowed down the traffic flow on the suburban roads, which in turn increased the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner.
  Option D suggests that road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner at the same time the new highway was being built. This may have caused traffic congestion on the important streets, which in turn increased the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner.
  Option E suggests that traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened. This may have caused traffic congestion on the roads leading to downtown Gastner, which in turn increased the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner.
  Option A and B both suggest that the new highway may have attracted more people to live in the suburbs, which in turn increased the number of people commuting to downtown Gastner. Therefore, either option A or B could be the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  Option C, D, and E may have contributed to the increase in average commute time, but they are not as directly related to the new highway as options A and B.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of identifying the polluter responsible for a river pollution incident.
  The penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the idea that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe, and therefore, the identity of the polluter must be certain before imposing the penalty.
  Principle A supports this reasoning by stating that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty.
  Principle B is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  Principle C is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  Principle D is not relevant to the argument because it addresses the issue of admitting responsibility, not the issue of certainty of guilt.
  Principle E is similar to Principle A, but it is less specific and does not directly address the issue of severity of the penalty.
  Therefore, Principle A is the most relevant principle that helps to justify the reasoning in the argument.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: The most important function of epic poetry is to transmit the values by which a group of people is to live. This transmission is accomplished not by an explicit discussion of those values, but rather by their embodiment in heroic figures, who are presented as role models. Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
Question: If the professor's statements are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: An important function of poetry is to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it.
  B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  C: When values are represented in poetry, they are rarely if ever set forth explicitly.
  D: For many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
  E: Only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models that, if imitated, give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear it.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

  One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns.
  A second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Thought: 
  The second group of doctors argues that the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  Therefore, the answer choice that supports this argument would be the one that shows that the brain's natural defenses are effective.
  Answer choice B states that some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  This supports the argument of the second group of doctors that bilirubin levels in newborn babies should be allowed to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

  The evidence is that Group A performed better than Group B in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  We need to find the option that is least helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  A: This option is helpful because it establishes that the two groups are comparable in size.
  B: This option is helpful because it establishes that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which eliminates the possibility of bias.
  C: This option is helpful because it establishes that there were no older college students in Group B who could have performed better than the younger college students.
  D: This option is helpful because it establishes that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which eliminates the possibility of a confounding variable.
  E: This option is helpful because it establishes that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which eliminates the possibility of a time-related confounding variable.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.
Question: The reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: widespread cynicism is beneficial to the wellbeing of society
  B: cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the am01mt of information one has about them

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Resident: Data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in our town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe. Hence, at least 60 percent of our town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Question: The reasoning in the resident's argument is flawed in that the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the town has a relatively small number of houses
  B: inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe
  C: structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage
  D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe
  E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The resident's argument states that 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Thought:
  The resident's argument assumes that the two problems are mutually exclusive, meaning that a house can only have one problem or the other.
  However, it is possible for a house to have both inadequate site drainage and structural defects that could make it unsafe.
  Therefore, the argument overlooks the possibility that some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
  The correct answer is E: some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.

  Your reasoning is correct.

  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Thought:
  The resident's argument assumes that the two problems are mutually exclusive, meaning that a house can only have one problem or the other.
  However, it is possible for a house to have both inadequate site drainage and structural defects that could make it unsafe.
  Therefore, the argument overlooks the possibility that some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
  The correct answer is E: some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.

  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought: 
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim.
  The assumption that would enable the conclusion to be properly drawn is one that supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice A suggests that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control, but this assumption does not support the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice B suggests that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This assumption does not support the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice C suggests that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. This assumption supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. This assumption does not support the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice E suggests that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed. This assumption does not support the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Therefore, the assumption that enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn is C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population for agricultural products can solve problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Thought:
  To support the economists' assertion, we need to find an option that shows that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population for agricultural products can solve problems caused by increasing urbanization.
  A: This option talks about government subsidies to urban manufacturers, which is not related to the assertion made by the economists.
  B: This option is too general and does not provide any specific support for the economists' assertion.
  C: This option suggests that a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization. This supports the economists' assertion that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population for agricultural products can solve problems caused by increasing urbanization.
  D: This option suggests that problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries, which is not related to the assertion made by the economists.
  E: This option suggests that free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization, which is not related to the assertion made by the economists.
  Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative

  B: Relying on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased is a type of ad hominem fallacy.
  C: Using two different meanings for the same term to draw a conclusion is a type of equivocation fallacy.
  D: Confusing an effect of a phenomenon with its cause is a type of causal fallacy.
  E: An unrepresentative sample is a type of sampling fallacy.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The physician conducted an experiment on 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  The patients were divided into two groups, one received small magnets and the other received no treatment.
  Most patients in the magnet group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the no-treatment group did.
Thought: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most patients in the magnet group reported a significant reduction in pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to find an option that weakens the physician's conclusion.
  A: This option suggests that the improvement in the magnet group could be due to the placebo effect, rather than the magnetic fields themselves. However, this does not necessarily mean that magnetic fields are not effective at relieving back pain.
  B: This option is irrelevant to the argument about magnetic fields and back pain.
  C: This option is also irrelevant to the argument about magnetic fields and back pain.
  D: This option suggests that the experiment may have been biased, but it does not necessarily mean that magnetic fields are not effective at relieving back pain.
  E: This option weakens the physician's argument by suggesting that the variation in the causes of the back pain could have affected the results of the experiment. If the causes of the back pain were different, then the effectiveness of magnetic fields could vary as well.
Criticism: 
  Option A weakens the physician's argument, but it does not necessarily mean that magnetic fields are not effective at relieving back pain.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the surprising result?
Choices:
  A: For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
  B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
  C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.

  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Thought: 
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  Option A suggests that shoppers do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise for the first several seconds after entering the store. This could explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers, as shoppers may not have noticed the Maxlast hammers on sale in the display case.
  Option B suggests that most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices. This does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers, as it does not address the impact of the sale on the Maxlast hammers.
  Option C suggests that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time. This does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers this week, as it only addresses the previous week's sales.
  Option D suggests that the hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers. This could explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers, as shoppers may have been more aware of the sale prices on Maxlast hammers due to the flyers.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store. This does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers, as it does not address the impact of the sale on the Maxlast hammers.

  Therefore, the best explanation for the surprising result is option D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
Criticism: 
  There could be other factors that influenced the sales of the hammers, such as the quality of the hammers or the location of the display case.
  However, given the information provided, option D is the most likely explanation for the surprising result.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The hardware store sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast and Styron brand hammers.
  Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Thought: 
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  Option A suggests that shoppers do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise for the first several seconds after entering the store. This could explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers, as shoppers may not have noticed the Maxlast hammers on sale in the display case.
  Option B suggests that most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices. This does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers, as it does not address the impact of the sale on the Maxlast hammers.
  Option C suggests that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time. This does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers this week, as it only addresses the previous week's sales.
  Option D suggests that the hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers. This could explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers, as shoppers may have been more aware of the sale prices on Maxlast hammers due to the flyers.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.

Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.

  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
    This statement does not undermine the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
    This statement does not undermine the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
    This statement does not undermine the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then it undermines the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.

Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.

  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, but this does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how they got to the islands.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon, but this does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, which would contradict the scientist's argument that the iguanas rafted across the Pacific from the Americas.
  E: The fact that numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, even with the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist cites studies conducted 30 years ago that show safety was reduced at every airport where permitted traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity.
Choices:
  A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does draw a conclusion based on a limited number of instances (the studies conducted 30 years ago), but this is not the most accurate description of the flaw.
  B: This choice suggests that the argument fails to consider the possibility that the latest technology might allow for increased air traffic without reducing safety. However, the editorialist specifically addresses this possibility by stating that even with the latest safety technology, safety was reduced at every airport where permitted traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity.
  C: This choice suggests that the argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies conducted 30 years ago. However, this is not a flaw in the argument itself, but rather a possibility that might weaken the editorialist's position.
  D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the argument. The editorialist cites studies conducted 30 years ago that show safety was reduced at every airport where permitted traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity. However, the editorialist fails to consider the possibility that there might be more recent studies or evidence that contradict this claim.
  E: This choice suggests that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind. However, the editorialist's argument is specifically focused on the issue of safety, and does not address the possibility of overriding benefits.

Topic: Law
Context: Psychiatrist: Take any visceral emotion you care to consider. There are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion. So, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Anger is always expressible.
  B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
  C: Some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express.
  D: All emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  E: An emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The argument is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
- The psychiatrist claims that any visceral emotion can be healthy to express in some situations.
Choices:
A: The argument does not claim that anger is always expressible, only that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express it. This choice goes beyond the scope of the argument.
B: This choice is relevant to the argument because the psychiatrist claims that any visceral emotion can be healthy to express in some situations, and anger is a visceral emotion.
C: This choice is not relevant to the argument because the psychiatrist claims that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger, not that some emotions are unhealthy to express.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument because the psychiatrist does not claim that all emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
E: This choice is not relevant to the argument because the psychiatrist claims that any visceral emotion can be healthy to express in some situations, not that an emotion is only visceral if it is healthy to express.
Thought:
The argument claims that any visceral emotion can be healthy to express in some situations, and anger is a visceral emotion. Therefore, it is healthy to try to express one's anger in some situations.
The assumption required for the argument to be valid is that anger is a visceral emotion that can be healthy to express in some situations.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Knowledge:

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: While it is true that bees' vision is well suited to the task of identifying flowers by their colors, it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the statement above?
Choices:
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This fact does not support the statement.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This fact does not support the statement.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This fact does not support the statement.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This fact does not support the statement.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This fact does not support the statement.
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If bees' vision developed in response to flower color, then other insects with similar vision would also depend on perceiving an object's color.
  Therefore, if many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color, then it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  The answer is A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
Criticism:
  The thought process is correct.
  However, the answer could also be interpreted as B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees, as this fact also suggests that flowers did not develop solely in response to bees' vision.

  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This fact does not support the statement.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This fact does not support the statement.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This fact does not support the statement.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This fact does not support the statement.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This fact does not support the statement.
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If bees' vision developed in response to flower color, then other insects with similar vision would also depend on perceiving an object's color.
  Therefore, if many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color, then it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

  The argument claims that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat, but if everyone adopted this diet, it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  The argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  The reasoning is that the universal adoption of the diet would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible.
  Therefore, the argument is based on the idea that a good thing (a healthy diet) can have unintended negative consequences (extinction of marine species).
  The argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of the diet because of these unintended negative consequences.
  The reasoning in option C is similar in that it argues that a good thing (limiting purchases to what one truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income) can have unintended negative consequences (throwing the economy into a severe recession).
  The argument concludes that we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone because of these unintended negative consequences.

  The reasoning in option C is similar in that it argues that a good thing (limiting purchases to what one truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income) can have unintended negative consequences (throwing the economy into a severe recession).
  The argument concludes that we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone because of these unintended negative consequences.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
Criticism: 
  The reasoning in option A is also similar in that it argues that a good thing (taking a vitamin E supplement every day) can have unintended negative consequences (vitamin E supplements may not be safe for all people).
  The argument concludes that we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day because of these unintended negative consequences.
  Therefore, option A could also be a correct answer.

Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat, but if everyone adopted this diet, it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  A: The argument claims that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces the risk of heart attack, but it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people.
  B: The argument claims that governments can tax tobacco heavily and spend the revenue on education, but if the taxes become too high, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding generated for education.
  C: The argument claims that limiting purchases to what one truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income is better for the consumer, but if everyone did this, it would throw the economy into a severe recession, making saving and investing impossible for most people.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

Thought:
  The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  This suggests that the amount of nicotine absorbed into the blood is not dependent on the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.
  Statement C suggests that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  This could help explain the study's findings, as it suggests that the amount of nicotine absorbed into the blood is not dependent on the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.

Topic: Law
Context: If grain prices double then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Grain prices doubling will cause the average price of a loaf of bread to rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Grain-fed beef prices will come close to doubling.
Choices:
  A: This statement is about labor costs in cattle production and does not explain the phenomenon described above.
  B: This statement provides information about the wholesale price per pound of beef and bread, but it does not explain the phenomenon described above.
  C: This statement provides information about the cost of producing bread and beef, but it does not explain the phenomenon described above.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.

  Option B strengthens the argument by stating that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales, which means that the use of lichens to monitor copper pollution can be applied in many places.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about the effectiveness of lichens as a replacement for mechanical monitoring devices.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal, which means that they may not be effective in areas with high levels of pollution.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about the effectiveness of lichens as a replacement for mechanical monitoring devices.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about the effectiveness of lichens as a replacement for mechanical monitoring devices.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal.
  H pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers.
  Only about 10% of people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it.

  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which also causes disease in some people.
  The argument claims that no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
  The argument assumes that the only reason to consider a bacterium a commensal is if it provides a benefit to the host.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a reason why H pylori might be considered a commensal despite causing disease in some people.
  Choice C provides such a reason by stating that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
Criticism: 
  None.

Topic: Law
Context: Principle: Any person or business knowingly aiding someone's infringement on a copyright is also guilty of copyright infringement. Application: Grandview Department Store, which features a self-service photo-printing kiosk, is guilty of copyright infringement since a customer using the kiosk infringed on a wedding photographer's copyright by printing photographs whose copyright is held by the photographer.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to justify the application of the principle?
Choices:
  A: The operator of a business has the same legal obligations to customers who use self-service facilities as it has to customers who use full-service facilities.
  B: The management of a business that is open to the public is obligated to report to the authorities any illegal activity that it witnesses on its property.
  C: The owner of a self-service printing kiosk should post a notice advising customers that copyrighted material should not be printed at the kiosk without the permission of the copyright holder.
  D: Owners of self-service facilities should monitor those facilities in order to ensure that they are not used for illegal or unethical purposes.
  E: A person or business providing a service that can be expected to be used to infringe on a copyright should be considered to knowingly aid any copyright infringer using the service. 15

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

Thought: 
  The question asks which of the following casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  If the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, it would suggest that the bear was not using navigational skills to return home.
  If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it would suggest that the bear was following a familiar path rather than using navigational skills.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries than in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  In Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument does not consider other factors that may contribute to colon cancer.
  Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism that it overlooks the possibility that there are other factors that contribute to colon cancer.
  Choice B is not a criticism of the argument, but rather supports it.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument, as it does not address the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
  Choice D is not a criticism of the argument, but rather a clarification of the different types of fiber.
  Choice E is a possible criticism of the argument, as it suggests that other substances in fiber-rich foods may be responsible for preventing colon cancer.
Criticism: 
  The argument assumes that fiber is the only factor that contributes to colon cancer.
  However, there may be other factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors, that also contribute to colon cancer.

  Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism that it overlooks the possibility that there are other factors that contribute to colon cancer.
  Choice B is not a criticism of the argument, but rather supports it.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument, as it does not address the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
  Choice D is not a criticism of the argument, but rather a clarification of the different types of fiber.
  Choice E is a possible criticism of the argument, as it suggests that other substances in fiber-rich foods may be responsible for preventing colon cancer.
Criticism: 
  The argument assumes that fiber is the only factor that contributes to colon cancer.
  However, there may be other factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors, that also contribute to colon cancer.
  Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism that it overlooks the possibility that there are other factors that contribute to colon cancer.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries than in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  In Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document
  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known
  E: takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information

  The passage states that modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. 
  It also states that one should exercise most days of the week, but only needs to do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits. 
  It further states that more vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
  Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is that it is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week.
  The answer is C: It is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
Thought:
  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity suggests that they would not live as long in captivity as they would in the wild.
  However, the fact that leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild suggests that captivity does not have a negative impact on their lifespan.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between these two facts.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why captivity does not have a negative impact on the lifespan of leatherbacks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice C suggests that predators are a major cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild, which could explain why leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice D suggests that it is difficult to create a suitable environment for captive leatherbacks, which could explain why leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Therefore, the best answer is either C or D.
Criticism:
  Choice C does not explain why captivity does not have a negative impact on the lifespan of leatherbacks.
  Choice D suggests a reason why captivity might have a negative impact on the lifespan of leatherbacks, which contradicts the fact that leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.

  The new shows they produced this season are all police dramas.
  Few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
Thought: 
  The argument is that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produce for this season will be canceled because most of the new shows they produced last season were canceled due to insufficient viewership and few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the new police dramas produced by Wilke & Wilke are likely to be canceled.
  Option A is irrelevant because the number of new shows produced this season does not affect the argument.
  Option B is also irrelevant because it does not provide any information about the likelihood of the new police dramas being canceled.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the non-police dramas produced last season were successful.
  Option D strengthens the argument because it suggests that police dramas are not successful for Wilke & Wilke.
  Option E is irrelevant because it does not provide any information about the likelihood of the new police dramas being canceled.
Criticism: 
  Option D suggests that all of the new shows produced last year that were canceled were police dramas, but the argument only states that most of the new shows produced last season were canceled.
  Therefore, Option D may not be entirely accurate.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: History provides many examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable. This shows that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: People correctly believe that technological innovations often cause job loss.
  B: People are often reluctant to take on new challenges.
  C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
  D: People tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations.
  E: People correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
Thought:
  The argument is based on the premise that people resist technological innovations because of social inertia.
  The argument assumes that people resist technological innovations because they are comfortable with the status quo.
  The argument assumes that people resist technological innovations because they feel safe with the status quo.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find an option that suggests that people resist technological innovations for reasons other than social inertia.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: We can be sure that at least some halogen lamps are well crafted, because halogen lamps from most major manufacturers are on display at Furniture Labyrinth. Any item on display at Furniture Labyrinth is well crafted.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above?
Choices:
  A: We can be confident that the temperature will drop abruptly on at least one day this week, for there is a chance of storms most days this week; whenever there are storms, the temperature drops suddenly.
  B: We can be positive that there are at least a few disturbing sonnets, given that Melinda has written several different kinds of sonnets; everything Melinda writes is disturbing.
  C: We can be sure that Gianna will get at least some good mechanical work done to her car, because she can have her car worked on at any of several shops in the city, and every shop is capable of doing good mechanical work.
  D: We can be positive that at least some minnows are healthy, because many different species of minnow can be found in lakes nearby, and every lake nearby is teeming with healthy fish.
  E: We can be confident that the cornmeal used at Matteo's Trattoria is healthful and organic, since cornmeal is among the ingredients used in preparing meals there; whenever a meal is prepared at Matteo's Trattoria, only healthful, organic ingredients are used.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.

- The journalist's statements do not support the idea that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun (choice A).
- The journalist's statements do not support the idea that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf (choice C).
- The journalist's statements do not support the idea that no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun (choice D).
- The journalist's statements do not support the idea that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere (choice E).

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
- Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Thought:
- The journalist states that brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- The journalist also states that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- The journalist further states that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- Finally, the journalist states that a brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
- From these statements, it can be inferred that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
- Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.

Criticism:
- The journalist's statements do not support the idea that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun (choice A).

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.

Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.

  C: The argument states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. However, the price of the stock did not increase in that time, so the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: The argument states that if the rebels won the battle and the jailed rebel leaders were freed, city residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels. Residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days, so the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: The argument states that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. However, the station's ratings actually decreased, so the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a hypothetical situation that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, the inflation rate increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  A presents a hypothetical situation that if the valley people were invaded or there was a climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture. However, the architecture remained the same, so the valley people must not have been invaded. 
  Both arguments present a hypothetical situation that did not occur and draw a conclusion based on the lack of evidence. 
  Therefore, A most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources and that wetland development is necessary for growth.
  Therefore, a principle that supports the idea that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice D states that environmental regulation cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. This principle supports the idea that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources without being held to the same standards as other nations.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise
  C: criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the most useful configuration.
  A: This statement does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective evidence.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans could have evolved to have six fingers if a fish with six phalanges in its fins had been our ancestor.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have evolved to have a different number of fingers if our ancestor had a different number of phalanges in its fins.
  Choice A does not provide any evidence to support this argument.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D supports the argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective evidence.
  Choice E weakens the argument by suggesting that humans could have evolved to have six fingers if a fish with six phalanges in its fins had been our ancestor.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Criticism: 
  The biologist's argument is based on the assumption that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the most useful configuration.
  However, the argument does not take into account the fact that evolution is a random process and that the number of fingers humans have may not be the result of any particular advantage or disadvantage.
  Additionally, the argument assumes that humans would be equally content with any number of fingers, which may not be true.

  A: This principle suggests that fresh ingredients should be used whenever possible, but it does not directly address the argument about dried parsley.
  B: This principle suggests that only the tastiest ingredients should be used, but it does not directly address the argument about dried parsley.
  C: This principle suggests that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful, which supports the argument about dried parsley.
  D: This principle is too specific to parsley and does not address the argument about dried parsley.
  E: This principle directly supports the argument that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.

  D: The fact that the corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place does not weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler was likely an actuary.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone.
  B: I have no reason to think that the practical joke I want to play would harm anyone. So, since the joke would show no contempt for the person the joke is played on, it would not be wrong for me to play it.
  C: Because of the circumstances, it would be wrong for me to play the practical joke I had intended to play on you. Even though it would not show contempt for anyone, it could easily bring you significant harm.
  D: It would have been wrong for me to play the practical joke that I had intended to play on you. Even though I did not have reason to think that it would significantly harm anyone, I did think that it would show contempt for someone.
  E: Someone was harmed as a result of my practical joke. Thus, even though it did not show contempt for the person I played the joke on, I should not have played it.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

  Therefore, the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives is that movie executives are concerned with maximizing the number of people who see a film to generate revenue from ticket sales, while television executives are concerned with attracting viewers who have purchasing power to attract sponsors.
  Choice D most helps to explain this difference because it directly states that television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
Criticism: 
  The other choices do not directly explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Choice B is irrelevant because it does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:

  This argument is challenged by scientists who hold that it formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  The geologist's argument is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  To weaken the geologist's argument, we need to find an answer that suggests that petroleum could have formed from deep carbon deposits without the need for living organisms.
  Answer A is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of whether petroleum can form from non-living material.
  Answer B is also irrelevant because it does not address the issue of how petroleum is formed.
  Answer C actually strengthens the geologist's argument because it suggests that it would take a long time for petroleum to form from non-living material.
  Answer D is also irrelevant because it does not address the issue of how petroleum is formed.
  Answer E weakens the geologist's argument because it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which supports the geologist's argument that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.

  This view has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  The geologist's argument is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  This argument is challenged by scientists who hold that it formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  The geologist's argument is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  To weaken the geologist's argument, we need to find an answer that suggests that petroleum could have formed from deep carbon deposits without the need for living organisms.
  Answer A is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of whether petroleum can form from non-living material.
  Answer B is also irrelevant because it does not address the issue of how petroleum is formed.
  Answer C actually strengthens the geologist's argument because it suggests that it would take a long time for petroleum to form from non-living material.
  Answer D is also irrelevant because it does not address the issue of how petroleum is formed.
  Answer E weakens the geologist's argument because it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which supports the geologist's argument that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Criticism:
  Your answer is correct. None of the other options address the issue of how petroleum is formed or how it could form without the need for living organisms.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: City leader: If our city adopts the new tourism plan, the amount of money that tourists spend here annually will increase by at least $2 billion, creating as many jobs as a new automobile manufacturing plant would. It would be reasonable for the city to spend the amount of money necessary to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant here, but adopting the tourism plan would cost less.
Question: The city leader's statements, if true, provide the most support for which one of the following
Choices:
  A: The city should implement the least expensive job creation measures available.
  B: In general, it is reasonable for the city to spend money to try to convince manufacturing companies to build plants in the city.
  C: The city cannot afford both to spend money to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant in the city and to adopt the new tourism plan.
  D: It would be reasonable for the city to adopt the new tourism plan.
  E: The only way the city can create jobs is by increasing tourism.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:

  E: A research institute funds an investigation into the mathematical properties of folded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease.
Thought: 
  The university president believes that research institutions have an obligation to promote research in any field of theoretical investigation if that research shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
  A: The research does not relate to practical concerns, so it does not meet the university president's principle.
  B: The research does not relate to practical concerns, so it does not meet the university president's principle.
  C: The research does not relate to practical concerns, so it does not meet the university president's principle.
  D: The research proposal sought to model certain poorly understood aspects of economic behavior, which could be considered a practical problem that affects people's quality of life. However, the foundation decided not to fund the proposal, so it does not meet the university president's principle.
  E: The research is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease, which could be considered a practical problem that affects people's quality of life. Therefore, it meets the university president's principle.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Sarah: When commercial fishing boats with permits to fish for certain species accidentally catch a type of fish for which they have no permit, the latter must be thrown back. This is a very wasteful practice because many, if not most, of the rejected fish do not survive. Fishing permits should therefore be altered so that fishers can keep fish caught accidentally. Amar: Making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more "accidents."
Question: The technique Amar uses in responding to Sarah's argument is to
Choices:
  A: question whether Sarah's recommendation can be put into practice
  B: point out that Sarah used a crucial term in two distinct senses
  C: allude to a factor that supposedly strengthens the case for Sarah's recommendation
  D: contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence
  E: maintain that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies
Response 0:

  Sarah argues that fishing permits should be altered so that fishers can keep fish caught accidentally.
  Amar argues that making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more "accidents."
Thought:
  Amar is responding to Sarah's argument by pointing out a potential negative consequence of her recommendation.
  He is suggesting that if fishers are allowed to keep fish caught accidentally, they may intentionally catch more of those fish, claiming that they were caught accidentally.
  This would lead to overfishing and depletion of certain fish populations.
  Therefore, Amar is using the technique of contending that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence.

  E: People who are already predisposed to dislike the client of a te1emarketiug agency are more likely to refuse to buy the product of that client than are people who are predisposed to like the client.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The principle is that employees of telemarketing agencies should never do anything that predisposes people to dislike the agencies' clients.
  The application is that if a person has said that he or she does not want to buy the product of a client of the agency, the employee should not try to talk them into buying it.
  A: This option talks about the ability of an employee to determine whether trying to talk someone into buying the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will likely engender animosity toward the client.
  B: This option talks about the uncertainty of some employees about whether trying to talk someone into buying the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will likely engender animosity toward the client.
  C: This option states that any employee of a telemarketing agency who tries to get someone to buy the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will engender animosity toward the client.
  D: This option talks about people who refuse to buy the product of a client of the agency even though they are not predisposed to dislike the client.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

This does not explain the study's findings that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  E: This choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This does not explain the study's findings that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Thought: 
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Choice B suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  If feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders, then it makes sense that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous, despite the fact that this drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy indicated above?
Choices:
  A: The drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available.
  B: The drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low.
  C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
  D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
  E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

  The argument concludes that the recent concert was probably not properly promoted because it did not sell out, despite Wells' belief that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
Thought: 
  Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, believed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  This pattern of reasoning involves a prediction based on a condition, and then using the absence of the predicted outcome to conclude that the condition was not met.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear.
  A: This criticism suggests that the argument is based on a small sample size and may not be representative of all Kodiak bears.
  B: This criticism suggests that the argument fails to consider other factors that may contribute to the behavior of walking on hind legs.
  C: This criticism suggests that the argument uses the term "behavior" inconsistently or in a way that is misleading.
  D: This criticism suggests that the argument assumes that there are only two ways to explain behavior, which may not be accurate.
  E: This criticism suggests that the argument relies too heavily on the authority of science without providing sufficient evidence to support its claims.
Thought:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear.
  The criticism that the argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity is a valid criticism.
  It is possible that both learning and innate capacity contribute to the behavior of walking on hind legs.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism B.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In marketing their products, drug companies often send gifts to physicians. According to a recent survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Question: If the survey results are accurate, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs than those who do accept such gifts.
  B: Most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians.
  C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  D: Some physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts.
  E: All physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts.

  Most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  The majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts.
Thought: 
  If the survey results are accurate, then it must be true that some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  This is because the survey results indicate that most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, but they believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  Therefore, some physicians must be mistaken about either their own level of influence or the level of influence on other physicians.
  The answer is C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. 
  The survey results indicate that there is a discrepancy between physicians' beliefs about their own level of influence and the level of influence on other physicians.
  Therefore, it is likely that some physicians are mistaken about either their own level of influence or the level of influence on other physicians.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Consumer magazine: Because front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers.

In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: When surveyed about which party they would like to see in the legislature, 40 percent of respondents said Conservative, 20 percent said Moderate, and 40 percent said Liberal. If the survey results are reliable, we can conclude that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses premises about the actual state of affairs to draw a conclusion about how matters should be.
  B: The argument draws a conclusion that merely restates a premise presented in favor of it.
  C: The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
  D: The argument fails to consider that the survey results might have been influenced by the political biases of the researchers who conducted the survey.
  E: The argument uses evidence that supports only rough estimates to draw a precisely quantified conclusion.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:

Choices:

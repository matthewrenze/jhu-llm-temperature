### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to five competing colas.
  A: This option suggests that the results may not be true for each of the five smaller groups.
  B: This option suggests that the advertisement assumes that the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola over the other colas in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: This option suggests that the advertisement overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This option suggests that the advertisement overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: This option suggests that the study only elicits consumers' responses to colas, and not other beverages.
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing colas tasted.
  However, the study only tested five competing colas, and there may be other colas or beverages that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  Additionally, the study only tested a small group of volunteers, and the results may not be true for the entire population.
  Therefore, the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  The answer is C.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  A: This choice criticizes the generalization made by the advertisement and suggests that the results may not be true for each of the five smaller groups.
  B: This choice criticizes the assumption made by the advertisement that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted.
  C: This choice criticizes the advertisement for overlooking the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This choice criticizes the advertisement for overlooking the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: This choice criticizes the study for not eliciting consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  However, the study only tested five competing colas and did not consider other factors that may influence consumer preferences.
  Therefore, the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  The answer is D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  However, choice A is also a valid criticism of the advertisement.
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  However, the study only tested five competing colas and did not consider other factors that may influence consumer preferences.

  D: This option suggests that the advertisement overlooks the possibility that people may prefer Sparkle Cola for reasons other than taste.
  E: This option suggests that the study only tested colas, and not other types of beverages.
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing colas tasted.
  However, the study only tested blindfolded volunteers, and it is unclear if the results would be the same for the general population.
  Additionally, the study only tested five competing colas, and there may be other colas or beverages that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  Therefore, the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  The answer is C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct. However, it is also possible that the blindfolded volunteers may have been influenced by factors other than taste, such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola.
  Therefore, option D could also be a valid criticism of the advertisement.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  A: This option suggests that the study may not be representative of the entire group of volunteers.
  B: This option suggests that the advertisement assumes that the preference for Sparkle Cola would translate to actual purchases.
  C: This option suggests that there may be other colas that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.

  Option A suggests that the study may not be representative of the entire group of volunteers, which could undermine the advertisement's claim.
  Option B is not relevant to the advertisement's claim about consumer preference.
  Option C suggests that there may be other colas that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola, which could undermine the advertisement's claim.
  Option D suggests that there may be other factors that influence consumers' preference for Sparkle Cola, which could undermine the advertisement's claim.
  Option E is not relevant to the advertisement's claim about consumer preference.
  Therefore, the most vulnerable criticism is either A or C.
Criticism: 
  Option A suggests that the study may not be representative of the entire group of volunteers, which could undermine the advertisement's claim.
  However, the advertisement states that the volunteers were divided evenly into five groups, which suggests that the study was designed to control for individual differences.
  Option C suggests that there may be other colas that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola, which could undermine the advertisement's claim.
  This is a valid criticism because the study only tested five competing colas, and there may be other colas that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  A: This option suggests that the study may not be representative of the entire group of volunteers, and that the results may not be true for each of the five smaller groups.

  Therefore, the most vulnerable criticism of the advertisement's reasoning is option C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  Blindfolded volunteers were divided into five groups and each group tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas.
  Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
Thought: 
  The advertisement is vulnerable to criticism because it is based on a study that only tested five competing colas, and it is possible that there are other colas that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  Choice A is not correct because the study did divide the volunteers into five smaller groups, so it did not overlook the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  Choice B is not correct because the advertisement does not take for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  Choice C is correct because the advertisement overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  Choice D is not correct because the advertisement does not overlook the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  Choice E is not correct because the advertisement is not vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  A: This choice suggests that the study may not be representative of the entire group of volunteers.
  B: This choice suggests that the advertisement assumes that the preference for Sparkle Cola would translate into actual purchases.
  C: This choice suggests that the study may not have tested all possible colas, and that there may be a cola that is preferred over Sparkle Cola.
  D: This choice suggests that there may be other factors that influence consumer preference for Sparkle Cola, such as packaging or price.
  E: This choice suggests that the study may not be generalizable to other types of beverages.
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  Choice A suggests that the study may not be representative of the entire group of volunteers, which could undermine the advertisement's claim.
  Choice B is not relevant to the advertisement's claim about consumer preference.
  Choice C suggests that there may be a cola that is preferred over Sparkle Cola, which could undermine the advertisement's claim.
  Choice D suggests that there may be other factors that influence consumer preference for Sparkle Cola, which could undermine the advertisement's claim.
  Choice E is not relevant to the advertisement's claim about consumer preference.
  Therefore, the best answer is either A or C.
Criticism: 
  Choice A suggests that the study may not be representative of the entire group of volunteers, which could undermine the advertisement's claim.
  However, the advertisement does not claim that the study is representative of the entire group of volunteers, so this criticism is not particularly strong.
  Choice C suggests that there may be a cola that is preferred over Sparkle Cola, which could undermine the advertisement's claim.
  This is a stronger criticism, as it directly challenges the advertisement's claim that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to five competing colas.
  A: This choice criticizes the generalization made from the study.
  B: This choice criticizes the assumption that the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola in real-life situations.
  C: This choice criticizes the possibility that there may be a better cola than Sparkle Cola that was not tested.
  D: This choice criticizes the possibility that people may prefer Sparkle Cola for reasons other than taste.
  E: This choice criticizes the study for only testing colas and not other beverages.
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the other colas tested.
  However, the study only tested five colas and did not test all possible colas.
  Therefore, it is possible that there are other colas that are more favorable than Sparkle Cola.
  Choice C criticizes this possibility.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that in a study, blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to five competing colas.
  A: This option suggests that the study may not be representative of the entire group of volunteers.
  B: This option suggests that the study may not be applicable to real-world situations.
  C: This option suggests that the study may not have tested all possible colas.
  D: This option suggests that the study may not have accounted for other factors that could influence consumer preferences.
  E: This option suggests that the study may not be generalizable to other types of beverages.
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing colas tasted.
  However, the study only tested five competing colas, and there may be other colas that were not tested that could elicit a more favorable response.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  The answer is C.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than those who do not.
Thought:
  The argument assumes that watching television is the only factor that influences people's perception of the risks posed by natural disasters.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics
Response 0:
Knowledge:

  Critics of the study observed that its sample size was very small.
  The study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that the study's results should not be doubted because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This argument is vulnerable to criticism because it does not address the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  None of the choices directly address this criticism, but A comes closest by suggesting that the argument takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole, which is a related issue.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is sound, but it is not the only possible criticism of the biologist's argument.
  For example, choice C suggests that the argument focuses on the study's author rather than on the study itself, which is another potential criticism.
  However, A is still the best answer because it directly addresses the issue of generalizability, which is the most relevant criticism in this case.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals indicates that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  A: Many university libraries charging higher fines for overdue books and periodicals does not directly relate to the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
  B: The fact that a university library's acquisition budget represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget does not directly relate to the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
  C: The argument assumes that publishers of scholarly journals are consistently profitable, but this option suggests that they may not be.
  D: The fact that most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and that subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years, weakens the argument that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  E: The frequency of publication of scholarly journals does not directly relate to the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
Thought: 
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals indicates that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  Option D weakens the argument by suggesting that subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years, which means that the increase in subscription rates is not necessarily an indication of increased profitability.
  Therefore, option D is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant flaw in the logic used to arrive at the answer.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Psychologist: Doctors should never prescribe sedatives for people with insomnia. Most cases of insomnia that psychologists treat are known to be caused by psychological stress. This suggests that insomniacs do not need drugs that alter their biochemistry, but rather need psychotherapy to help them alleviate the stress causing their insomnia.
Question: Each of the following describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: It presumes, without providing warrant, that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress.
  B: It fails to consider the possibility that sedatives are the only treatment known to be effective for cases of insomnia not caused by stress.
  C: It neglects the possibility that for some people psychotherapy is a completely ineffective treatment for stress.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress.
  E: It presumes, without providing justification, that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument is that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the implementation of the plan.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B weakens the argument because it shows that the decrease in patient injuries is not necessarily due to the implementation of the plan.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D strengthens the argument by showing that the decrease in patient injuries did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  Choice D does not necessarily prove that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan. It only shows that the staff became more careful after they became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  It is possible that the decrease in patient injuries is due to other factors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument is that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports this causal relationship.
  A: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This answer choice weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is not solely due to the implementation of the plan.
  C: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: This answer choice supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff's awareness of the monitoring of their errors.
  E: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  Answer choice D only suggests a correlation between the staff's awareness of the monitoring and the decrease in patient injuries. It does not prove that the decrease is solely due to the implementation of the plan.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.

  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports this causal relationship.
  A: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This answer choice weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be due to the implementation of the plan.
  C: This answer choice weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to capture all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  D: This answer choice supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff becoming more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties after becoming aware that their errors were being monitored.
  E: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  Answer choice D assumes that the staff became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties after becoming aware that their errors were being monitored. It is possible that the decrease in patient injuries was due to other factors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record all staff errors.

  A: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This answer choice weakens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries is not solely due to the implementation of the plan.
  C: This answer choice weakens the argument by suggesting that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to capture all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  D: This answer choice strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the implementation of the plan and the staff's awareness of the monitoring of their errors.
  E: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument.

  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D strengthens the argument because it shows that the decrease in patient injuries did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, which suggests that the knowledge of being monitored was a motivating factor for the staff to be more careful.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  Choice D only suggests that the knowledge of being monitored was a motivating factor for the staff to be more careful, but it does not prove that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the implementation of the plan.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument is that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer that supports the idea that the plan caused the decrease in patient injuries.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be due to the implementation of the plan.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff's awareness of the monitoring of their errors.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  The argument assumes that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan, but it does not rule out other factors that may have contributed to the decrease.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument states that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the plan was the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.

  The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports this claim.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
  Option A could be relevant because it suggests that the hospitals already had a policy of investigating staff errors, which could have made the staff more careful even before the implementation of the plan.
  Option D is the most relevant because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff becoming aware that their errors were being closely monitored, which supports the argument that the plan was effective in making the staff more careful.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms

Thought:
  Larew and Mendota disagree about whether the change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income or by comparing the absolute amount of the increase in average income.
  Therefore, the answer is A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct. 
  The question is asking about the specific point of disagreement between Larew and Mendota, which is whether the change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
  Therefore, the answer is A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Larew argues that the lowest income quintile had a higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than the highest quintile, so their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's.
  Mendota disagrees with Larew's argument.
Thought: 
  Larew and Mendota disagree about whether the change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income or not.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development in Figoria should be regulated and offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.

  Option B: If the location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs, then it is possible that the new highway has increased the number of cars on the road leading to downtown Gastner, which could explain the increase in average commute time. This option is a possible explanation.
  Option C: If several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights, then it is possible that the new stoplights have caused traffic congestion on the road leading to downtown Gastner, which could explain the increase in average commute time. This option is a possible explanation.
  Option D: If road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner at the same time the new highway was being built, then it is possible that the road repair work has caused traffic congestion on the road leading to downtown Gastner, which could explain the increase in average commute time. This option is a possible explanation.
  Option E: If traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened, then it is possible that the new highway has caused traffic congestion on the road leading to downtown Gastner, which could explain the increase in average commute time. This option is a possible explanation.
  Out of all the options, options A, B, C, D, and E are all possible explanations for the increase in average commute time.
  However, option A and B are the most likely explanations because they directly relate to the new highway and the suburbs that it connects to downtown Gastner.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of identifying the polluter responsible for a river pollution incident.
  The penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
Thought:
  The argument is based on the idea that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe, and therefore, it is necessary to be certain of the identity of the polluter before imposing the penalty.
  Principle A supports this reasoning by stating that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  Principles B, C, D, and E are not directly relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, Principle A is the most helpful principle to justify the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")

  The penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the idea that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe, and therefore, the identity of the polluter must be certain before imposing the penalty.
  Principle A supports this reasoning by stating that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty.
  Principle B is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  Principle C is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  Principle D is not relevant to the argument because it addresses the issue of admitting responsibility, not the issue of certainty of guilt.
  Principle E contradicts the argument by stating that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
  Therefore, Principle A is the most relevant principle that helps to justify the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of identifying the polluter responsible for a river pollution incident.
  The penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the idea that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe, and therefore, the identity of the polluter must be certain before imposing the penalty.
  Principle A supports this reasoning by stating that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty.
  Principle B is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  Principle C is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  Principle D is not relevant to the argument because it addresses the issue of admitting responsibility, not the issue of certainty of guilt.
  Principle E is similar to Principle A, but it is less specific and does not directly address the issue of severity of the penalty.
  Therefore, Principle A is the most relevant principle that helps to justify the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of identifying the polluter responsible for a river pollution incident.
  The penalty for this type of pollution is severe.

Thought:
  The argument is based on the idea that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
  The reasoning in the argument is justified by the principle that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Criticism: 
  The argument does not mention the severity of the penalty as the reason for needing stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility.
  The argument suggests that the severity of the penalty is a factor in the decision to impose it, but not the main reason for needing stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility.
  Therefore, the answer may not be A.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of identifying the polluter responsible for a river pollution incident.
  The penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the idea that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe, and therefore, the identity of the polluter must be certain before imposing the penalty.

  Therefore, Principle A most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a polluter without sufficient evidence.
  A: This principle suggests that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing the penalty.
  B: This principle suggests that penalties should be severe enough to deter crime, but not so severe as to discourage imposing them.
  C: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused by the infraction.
  D: This principle suggests that the more severe the penalty, the less likely someone is to admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it is impossible to be certain of guilt before imposing the penalty.
Thought: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a polluter without sufficient evidence.
  The penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The severity of the penalty makes it difficult to impose it without sufficient evidence.
  Therefore, the principle that suggests that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it is impossible to be certain of guilt before imposing the penalty most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument.
  The answer is E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Criticism: 
  The argument is not about the severity of the penalty being too great to be certain of guilt, but rather about the difficulty of imposing the penalty without sufficient evidence.
  Therefore, the principle in E is not the most helpful in justifying the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:

  Therefore, choice A is the most helpful principle to justify the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a polluter without sufficient evidence.
  A: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the certainty of guilt.
  B: This principle discusses the appropriate level of severity for penalties, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  C: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  D: This principle suggests that severe penalties may discourage people from admitting responsibility, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  E: This principle is directly relevant to the argument, as it suggests that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it cannot be justified by the evidence.
Thought: 
  The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a penalty without sufficient evidence.
  The principle that would most help justify this reasoning is one that suggests that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it cannot be justified by the evidence.
  This principle is expressed in choice E.
  Therefore, choice E is the best answer.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant flaw in the logic or reasoning used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("E")

  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Criticism: 
  The argument does not address the issue of deterrence or proportionality of the penalty.
  The argument is focused on the difficulty of identifying the polluter responsible for the pollution incident.
  Therefore, the principle in choice A may not be the most relevant or helpful to justify the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The Florida panther population has increased from the 1970s but is still not self-sustaining.
- The current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers.
Choices:
A: The statement is possible, but it is not necessarily true based on the information given.
B: The statement is not true based on the information given. The passage only states that the population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining, not that it will be self-sustaining if it exceeds that number.
C: The statement is true based on the information given. The passage states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers, so unless they acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
D: The statement is not necessarily true based on the information given. The passage states that the population has increased from the 1970s, but it does not make any predictions about future increases.
E: The statement is not necessarily true based on the information given. The passage only states that the Florida panther population has increased from the 1970s, but it does not provide any information about the size of their habitat.
Thought:
- The passage states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers.
- The passage also states that the population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining.
- Therefore, unless the Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
- Choice C is the only statement that follows logically from the information given.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The Florida panther population has increased from the 1970s, but it is still not large enough to be self-sustaining.
- The current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers.
Choices:
A: The statement that the panthers' current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals suggests that some part of the habitat may be of marginal quality, but this is not necessarily true. It is possible that the habitat is of good quality but simply not large enough to support more panthers.
B: The passage does not provide evidence to support this statement. While a population of at least 250 is necessary for self-sustainability, it does not necessarily follow that exceeding this number will guarantee self-sustainability.
C: This statement is supported by the passage. The passage states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers, and that the population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Therefore, unless the panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
D: The passage does not provide evidence to support this statement. While the population may not increase much beyond its current level without a larger habitat, it is not necessarily true that it will never increase much beyond its current level.
E: The passage does not provide evidence to support this statement. While the passage states that the panther population has increased since the 1970s, it does not provide information about the size of their habitat.
Thought:
- The current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers.
- The population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
- Therefore, unless the panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
- Choice C accurately reflects this information.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Florida panthers are an endangered species.
  There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today.
  Their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
Thought: 
  The passage states that the current habitat of Florida panthers is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  Therefore, unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  The answer is C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
Criticism: 
  There is no information in the passage to support answer choice A, B, D, or E.
  Answer choice B is incorrect because the passage states that the population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining, not that it will be self-sustaining if it exceeds 250.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The Florida panther population has increased from the 1970s but is still not self-sustaining.
- The current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.

- There is no information in the context to support this statement. It is not a necessary conclusion from the given information.
B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
- The context states that the population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Therefore, it is not true that if the population exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
- The context states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals. Therefore, it is true that unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
- The context does not support this statement. It is not a necessary conclusion from the given information.
E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  The advertisement suggests that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Thought: 
  A: If some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened. However, the advertisement claims that the sample is representative of all new policyholders, so it is unlikely that many policyholders saved little or no money.
  B: If the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened. However, the advertisement does not provide any information about the premiums paid by new policyholders versus long-term policyholders.
  C: If switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened. However, the advertisement does not provide any information about the savings offered by other insurance companies.
  D: If many of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened. However, the advertisement claims that the sample is representative of all new policyholders, so it is unlikely that many policyholders underestimated their savings.
  E: If people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened. However, the advertisement does not provide any information about the demographics of new policyholders.
Criticism: 
  The advertisement assumes that the sample is representative of all new policyholders, but it is possible that the sample is biased in some way. For example, the sample may have been self-selected or may not have included policyholders who switched to Popelka but later switched back to their previous insurer. Additionally, the advertisement does not provide any information about the premiums paid by new policyholders versus long-term policyholders, so it is possible that the savings reported by the sample are not representative of the savings that most policyholders could achieve by switching to Popelka.

Thought: 
  The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
  A: If at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the advertisement's claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  B: If the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time, then the advertisement's claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  C: If switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka, then the advertisement's claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  D: If few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the advertisement's claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be strengthened.

Criticism: 
  The advertisement assumes that the sample of new policyholders is representative of all new policyholders, but it is possible that the sample is biased in some way. For example, the sample may have been drawn from a population of people who were more likely to switch to Popelka because they were dissatisfied with their previous insurance company or because they were offered a special promotion. If the sample is biased, then the savings reported by the sample may not be representative of the savings that most people could achieve by switching to Popelka.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

  The second group of doctors argues that the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  Therefore, the answer choice that supports this argument would be the one that shows that the brain's natural defenses are effective.
  Answer choice B states that some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  This supports the argument of the second group of doctors that bilirubin levels in newborn babies should be allowed to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin.
  One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns.
  A second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Thought: 
  The second group of doctors argues that the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  Therefore, the answer choice that supports this argument the most is the correct answer.
  Option B states that some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  This supports the argument of the second group of doctors that bilirubin levels in newborn babies should be allowed to remain high.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic used to arrive at the answer.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

  Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence is that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) performed better than Group B (composed of college students) in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  Answer choice A is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that the groups are comparable in size.
  Answer choice B is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  Answer choice C is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that there were no older college students who could have skewed the results.
  Answer choice D is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  Answer choice E is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices are least helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared two groups of people: Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students).
  Each member of the two groups was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time, and the time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically.
  Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence is that Group A performed better than Group B in making a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  A: This statement is helpful because it establishes that the two groups were of equal size, which is important for ensuring that the results are not skewed by differences in sample size.
  B: This statement is helpful because it establishes that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which is important for ensuring that the results are not skewed by differences in the way the calls were answered.
  C: This statement is not helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it does not address the issue of memory performance in different age groups.
  D: This statement is helpful because it establishes that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which is important for ensuring that the results are not skewed by differences in access to telephones.
  E: This statement is helpful because it establishes that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which is important for ensuring that the results are not skewed by differences in the amount of time the two groups had to prepare for the task.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
Criticism: 
  The statement in option C is not relevant to the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages. 
  It is possible that the college students in Group B performed worse than Group A because they were younger, but this statement does not address that issue.
  However, the other statements are all relevant to the conclusion and provide important information about the study design and methodology.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared two groups of people: Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students).
  Each member of the two groups was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time, and the time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically.
  Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence is that Group A was far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
  We need to find the option that is least helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn.
  A: This option is helpful because it tells us that the two groups were of the same size, which is important for making a fair comparison.
  B: This option is helpful because it tells us that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which is important for ensuring consistency in the study.
  C: This option is somewhat helpful because it tells us that there were no older people in Group B who might have had better memory than the college students. However, this option is not as helpful as options A and B.
  D: This option is helpful because it tells us that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which is important for ensuring that the study was fair.
  E: This option is helpful because it tells us that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which is important for ensuring that the study was fair.
  Therefore, the least helpful option is C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared the ability of two groups, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), to make a telephone call at a specified time.
  Group A had only one lapse, while Group B had fourteen lapses.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The fact that there was the same number of people in each group (A) and that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls (D) are helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
  The fact that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups (B) is also helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
  The fact that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls (E) is also helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
  The fact that among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old (C) is not helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn, as it does not relate to the comparison of memory between the two groups.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer as it is the least helpful in establishing the conclusion.

  Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the fact that Group A (composed of older people) performed better than Group B (composed of college students) in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  To establish that the conclusion is properly drawn, we need to find the option that is least helpful in supporting the conclusion.
  Option A is helpful because it tells us that the two groups had the same number of people, which means that the comparison is fair.
  Option B is helpful because it tells us that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which means that the comparison is fair.
  Option C is helpful because it tells us that there were no persons more than forty years old among the college students, which means that the comparison is fair.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.

Context: Resident: Data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in our town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe. Hence, at least 60 percent of our town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Question: The reasoning in the resident's argument is flawed in that the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the town has a relatively small number of houses
  B: inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe
  C: structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage
  D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe
  E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The resident claims that 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.

  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Thought:
  The resident's argument assumes that the two problems are mutually exclusive, i.e., a house can either have inadequate site drainage or structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that some houses may have both problems.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct.
Action: Answer("E")

Thought:
  The resident's argument assumes that the two categories of problems are mutually exclusive, i.e., that a house can have either inadequate site drainage or structural defects, but not both.
  However, this assumption is not necessarily true.
  It is possible that some houses have both inadequate site drainage and structural defects, which means that the actual percentage of houses with problems could be lower than 60%.
  Therefore, the argument overlooks the possibility that some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.

  The data indicates that 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  A: The size of the town is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The argument acknowledges that inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe.
  C: The argument does not compare the ease of fixing inadequate site drainage versus structural defects.
  D: This is a possibility that the argument overlooks.
  E: This is a possibility that the argument acknowledges.
Thought: 
  The argument states that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The argument is based on the fact that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  However, the argument overlooks the possibility that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  If many houses in the town have neither of these problems, then the argument's conclusion that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity may not be valid.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  There is no flaw in your logic.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that the rarest species of trees tend to survive longer than the most common species in a particular forest.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an explanation of why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
  Option A provides a possible explanation that the most common species is best suited to the local climate, which means that the rarest species may not be as well-suited to the climate and therefore may have a longer lifespan.
  Option B is not relevant to the question as it discusses the reproduction of older trees, not their survival.
  Option C is not relevant to the question as it discusses the methodology of the study, not an explanation for the survival of the rarest species.
  Option D provides a possible explanation that the survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction, which may give them an advantage in terms of survival.
  Option E provides a possible explanation that the trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species, which may lead to a shorter lifespan for the common species.
  Both options A and E provide possible explanations for the survival of the rarest species, but option E seems to be a more direct explanation for why the rarest species tend to survive longer than the most common species.
Criticism: 
  Option A provides a possible explanation, but it is not as direct as option E.
  Option D provides an explanation for why the survival of the rarest species is important, but it does not directly explain why the rarest species tend to survive longer than the most common species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:

  The question asks for an explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
  Option A provides a possible explanation for why the most common species thrives in the forest, but it does not explain why the rarest species tends to survive longer.
  Option B is irrelevant to the question because it talks about reproduction, not survival.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the question because it talks about the methodology of the study, not the survival of trees.
  Option D provides a possible explanation for why the survival of the trees of the rarer species is beneficial, but it does not explain why the rarest species tends to survive longer.
  Option E provides a possible explanation for why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species because they have less competition for resources.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought: 
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim.
  The assumption that would enable the conclusion to be properly drawn is one that supports the idea that we can still praise or blame a person for an action even if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  Choice A suggests that people should not be praised or blamed for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B suggests that the responsibility for an act is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, which is also not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed, which is not the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise varies with the amount of information available. This supports the idea that we can still praise or blame a person for an action even if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  Choice E suggests that if we do not know much about the events leading up to an action, we will regard that action as freely performed, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn is D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:

  Tolstoy claimed that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Choices:
  A: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist.
  B: This choice is consistent with the argument made by the ethicist, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  C: This choice is consistent with the argument made by the ethicist, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  D: This choice is not consistent with the argument made by the ethicist.
  E: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist.
Thought: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice B is consistent with the argument made by the ethicist, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  Choice C is consistent with the argument made by the ethicist, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  Choice D is not consistent with the argument made by the ethicist.
  Therefore, none of the choices enable the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
  However, if we assume that the ethicist is correct in his argument, then we can conclude that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  Therefore, the best answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought: 
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn must support the idea that we can still praise or blame a person for an action even if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  Choice A suggests that people should not be praised or blamed for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control, but this does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice B suggests that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, which supports the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice C suggests that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed, which contradicts the premise of the argument.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available, which does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice E suggests that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed, but this does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  Therefore, the assumption that enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn is choice B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Tolstoy claimed that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Choices:
  A: This answer choice is related to the concept of determinism, which is not directly relevant to the argument made by the ethicist. Therefore, this choice is not the correct answer.
  B: This answer choice is consistent with the argument made by the ethicist. If whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, then the conclusion of the ethicist's argument can be properly drawn. Therefore, this choice is a possible answer.
  C: This answer choice is restating the argument made by the ethicist, but it does not enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn. Therefore, this choice is not the correct answer.
  D: This answer choice is introducing a new concept of responsibility that is not directly relevant to the argument made by the ethicist. Therefore, this choice is not the correct answer.
  E: This answer choice is the opposite of what the ethicist is arguing. The ethicist is arguing that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. Therefore, if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we cannot regard that action as freely performed. Therefore, this choice is not the correct answer.
Thought: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Answer choice B states that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  If this is true, then the conclusion of the ethicist's argument can be properly drawn.
  Therefore, answer choice B is the correct answer.

  Choice C suggests that we can only be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed, which contradicts the ethicist's argument.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available, which supports the idea that we can still praise or blame a person for an action even if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  Choice E suggests that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed, but this does not support the idea that we can still praise or blame a person for an action even if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  Therefore, the assumption that enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn is Choice B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion

  The study only showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81. 
  Therefore, the pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. The pharmacist's argument is flawed because it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause. 
  The study only showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81, but it did not show that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages. 
  Therefore, the pharmacist's conclusion that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct is not supported by the evidence provided.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist argues that a study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81.
  The pharmacist concludes that the claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland that plays a role in regulating the body's biological clock.
Choices:
  A: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the pharmacist.
  B: The argument does not rely on the opinions of biased individuals.
  C: The argument does not use two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion.
  D: This choice is the best answer. The argument confuses the effect of a phenomenon (ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms) with its cause (the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages).
  E: The argument does not rely on an unrepresentative sample.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The physician conducted an experiment on 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  The patients were divided into two groups, one received small magnets and the other received no treatment.
  Most patients in the magnet group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the other group did.
Thought:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to find an option that weakens the physician's conclusion.
  A: This option suggests that the improvement in the magnet group could be due to a placebo effect rather than the magnetic fields themselves. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument.
  B: This option is irrelevant to the physician's argument.
  C: This option suggests that the experiment's results may not be generalizable to other areas of pain. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument.
  D: This option suggests that the experiment may have been biased due to the scientists' preconceived beliefs. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument.
  E: This option weakens the physician's argument by suggesting that the variation in the causes of the patients' chronic back pain could have affected the results of the experiment.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.

  However, option B is more relevant because it directly addresses the idea that customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices, which could explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The hardware store sells Maxlast and Styron brand hammers.
  Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  Option A is not relevant to the surprising result.
  Option B suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices, which contradicts the fact that the Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Option C suggests that customers bought Maxlast hammers because they were on sale, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option D suggests that the sale prices on Maxlast hammers were publicized, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, none of the options explain the surprising result.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The hardware store sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast and Styron brand hammers.
  Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Thought: 
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers, even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  Option A is not relevant to the surprising result.
  Option B suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices, which would explain the surprising result, but it is not clear that this is the case.
  Option C suggests that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week did so because of the sale, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers this week.
  Option D suggests that the sale was advertised, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers this week.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers this week.
  Therefore, none of the options fully explain the surprising result.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. None of the options fully explain the surprising result.

Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.

Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers

  The argument assumes that the hair dryer is Wilson Appliance's only product.
  The argument assumes that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has remained constant over the past 5 years.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about the decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer and its impact on the company's net income.
  A: Market share refers to the percentage of total sales in a market that is captured by a particular company or product. The argument does not mistake a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product.
  B: The argument does not need to provide specific information about the profits hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them because it is only concerned with Wilson Appliance's net income from sales of its hair dryer.
  C: The argument does not need to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers because it is only concerned with the company's net income from sales of its hair dryer.
  D: The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which would affect the company's net income from sales of the product.
  E: The argument does not provide any evidence about whether Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

  The flaw in the editorialist's argument is that the studies cited are 30 years old and may not be applicable to the latest safety technology.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.
  The editorialist's argument fails to consider the possibility that the latest safety technology may be able to handle increased air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity.

  The editorialist cites studies conducted 30 years ago that show safety was reduced at every airport where traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity.
Choices:
  A: This choice describes a flaw in the argument, but it is not the most accurate. The argument does draw a conclusion based on a limited number of instances (the studies conducted 30 years ago), but this is not the most accurate flaw in the argument.
  B: This choice is not a flaw in the argument. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the latest technology could allow for more air traffic. The argument specifically mentions that council members believe the latest safety technology would allow for more air traffic without decreasing safety.
  C: This choice is not a flaw in the argument. The argument does not address whether council members are aware of the studies conducted 30 years ago.
  D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the argument. The argument assumes that the absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity is evidence against this claim. However, this is not necessarily true. The absence of evidence does not prove the opposite claim.
  E: This choice is not a flaw in the argument. The argument does not address whether a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion

  D: This choice suggests that the argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
  E: This choice suggests that the argument takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not address the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not address the number of bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not address the safety of motorists.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not address the safety of some roads that currently have bicycle lanes.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument because it suggests that the argument takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.
  The argument assumes that the presence of bicycle lanes causes more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles, but it does not consider other factors that may contribute to the higher collision rate, such as the behavior of drivers or bicyclists. Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: While it is true that bees' vision is well suited to the task of identifying flowers by their colors, it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the statement above?
Choices:
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This does not support the statement.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This does not support the statement.

  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This does not support the statement.
Thought: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If bees' vision developed in response to flower color, then other insects with similar vision would also depend on perceiving an object's color.
  Therefore, if many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color, then it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
Criticism: 
  The argument is valid, but it is not strong enough to support the statement above "most strongly". 
  The fact that many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color does not necessarily mean that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.

  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This fact does not support the statement.
Thought:
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
  To support this statement, we need to find an option that suggests that flowers existed before bees developed their vision.
  Option C suggests that there were more species of flowers than bees, which could mean that flowers existed before bees developed their vision.
  Therefore, option C most strongly supports the statement above.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.

  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Thought:
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If the number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If many nonflowering plants rely on bees, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Criticism:
  The answer is not conclusive evidence that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have. It only suggests that it is more likely.
Action: Answer("E")

  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This fact does not support the statement.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This fact does not support the statement.
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If there is evidence that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, then it would support the statement.
  None of the choices provide evidence that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  Therefore, none of the choices support the statement.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct, but the answer is not "None of the Above".
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  Choice A suggests that many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
  This fact supports the statement because it suggests that bees' vision is unique and that flowers developed in response to it.
  Therefore, the answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Thought:
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  If the number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  If many nonflowering plants rely on bees, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
Criticism:
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  While the number of different species of flowers being greater than the number of different species of bees may support the idea that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision, it is not a strong argument.
  Other factors, such as the availability of pollinators, could also have influenced the evolution of flowers.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This fact does not support the statement.

  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This fact does not support the statement.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This fact does not support the statement.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This fact does not support the statement.
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If bees' vision developed in response to flower color, then other insects with similar vision would also depend on perceiving an object's color.
  Therefore, if many insects with similar vision do not depend on perceiving an object's color, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
Criticism:
  The argument is valid, but it is not necessarily strong. 
  The fact that many insects with similar vision do not depend on perceiving an object's color does not necessarily mean that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  There could be other reasons why flowers developed the way they did.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This does not support the statement.

  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This does not support the statement.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This does not support the statement.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This does not support the statement.
Thought: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If bees' vision developed in response to flower color, then it would be expected that other insects with similar vision would also depend on perceiving an object's color.
  Therefore, if many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  The answer is A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
Criticism: 
  The answer is not conclusive, as it only weakly supports the statement.
  It is possible that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, even if other insects with similar vision do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This does not directly support the statement.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This suggests that flowers did not necessarily develop in response to bees' vision.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This does not directly support the statement.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This does not directly support the statement.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This supports the idea that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that a fish-based diet is healthier than a red meat-based diet, but universal adoption of such a diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a trade-off between health benefits and environmental impact.
  It suggests that the universal adoption of a fish-based diet would have negative consequences for the environment.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  A: The argument is about moderation and how it fails to take into account biological differences.
  B: The argument is about banning a device due to its potential to cause cancer in laboratory animals.
  C: The argument is about the need for Acme to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: The argument is about the relationship between engaging characters and the sale of novels and stories.
  E: The argument is about the flawed criterion for judging a movie's success in the movie industry.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  The argument is that if the company is concerned about distractions, it should block all distractions, not just some.
  Therefore, the argument is most similar in its reasoning to D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  The argument is that engaging characters are not the only factor in selling novels and stories, just as blocking non-work-related websites is not the only factor in reducing distractions.
Action: Answer("D")

  E: The argument is about the flawed criterion for judging a movie's success in the movie industry.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace that are not being addressed.
  The argument is that the company's reasoning for installing the software is flawed because it only addresses one type of distraction.
  Therefore, the argument is most similar in its reasoning to D: the argument about engaging characters and the success of a novel or story.
  The argument is that engaging characters are important, but they do not guarantee success because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  Similarly, the employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because it only addresses one type of distraction, and there are other distractions that are not being addressed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  A: The argument is about how different people react differently to substances, and that moderation is not a useful concept because of biological differences.
  B: The argument is about how banning a device due to its potential to cause cancer in laboratory animals is not reasonable because most chemicals can cause cancer in high doses.
  C: The argument is about how Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because 1,000 employees are expected to retire.
  D: The argument is about how engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the publishing industry.
  E: The argument is about how judging a movie's success based on its profit relative to its cost is misguided.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  The argument is that if the company is concerned about distractions, it should block all potential distractions, not just some.
  Therefore, the argument is most similar to D: engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the publishing industry.
  The argument is that if publishers are concerned about selling books, they should focus on more than just engaging characters.

  The argument is that just because one element is important, it does not mean that other elements are not important as well.
Criticism: 
  The argument is not about the importance of different elements, but rather about the need to block all distractions if the company is concerned about distractions.

  The argument is that while engaging characters are important, they are not the only factor in determining the success of a novel or story.
Criticism: 
  The argument could also be similar to E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
  Both arguments point out flaws in a single criterion for success, but the movie industry argument is more about the criterion itself, while the creative writing argument is more about the importance of other factors.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

Thought: 
  The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  The study suggests that the level of nicotine in the blood is not affected by the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.
  Choice A suggests that blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available. This would support the study's finding that the level of nicotine in the blood is not affected by the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.
  Choice B suggests that smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes. This would not explain the study's finding that the level of nicotine in the blood is not affected by the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.
  Choice C suggests that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities. This would support the study's finding that the level of nicotine in the blood is not affected by the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.
  Choice D suggests that the level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes. This would not explain the study's finding that the level of nicotine in the blood is not affected by the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.
  Choice E suggests that when taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily. This would not explain the study's finding that the level of nicotine in the blood is not affected by the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If grain prices double then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.

Knowledge: 
  Grain prices doubling will cause the average price of a loaf of bread to rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Grain-fed beef prices will come close to doubling.
  A: The labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef are generally reduced by farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Thought: 
  Grain prices doubling will cause the price of bread to rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  Therefore, the cost of producing beef is much higher than the cost of producing bread.
  The cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  Therefore, the cost of producing beef is high because of the cost of feeding cattle with grain.
  The phenomenon described above can be explained by the fact that the cost of producing beef is much higher than the cost of producing bread.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  However, the statement "Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain" is not relevant to the explanation of the phenomenon described above.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Grain prices doubling will cause the average price of a loaf of bread to rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Grain-fed beef prices will come close to doubling.
Choices:
  A: This statement is about labor costs in cattle production and does not explain the phenomenon described above.
  B: This statement provides information about the wholesale price of beef and bread, but it does not explain the phenomenon described above.
  C: This statement provides information about the cost of producing bread and beef, but it does not explain the phenomenon described above.
  D: This statement provides information about the proportion of beef produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, but it does not explain the phenomenon described above.
  E: This statement provides information about the retail grocery outlets' purchasing practices for bread and meat, but it does not explain the phenomenon described above.
Thought:
  The phenomenon described above is that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling while the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  The difference in price increase could be due to the cost of feeding cattle representing most of the cost of producing beef.
  If most of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grain, then the price increase for beef would be higher than for bread.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
Criticism:
  The statement in option D is about the proportion of beef produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, not the proportion of beef produced from cattle fed on grain.
  However, the statement is still relevant because it suggests that most beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grain, which supports the reasoning above.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The phenomenon described is that if grain prices double, the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  A: This statement is about labor costs in cattle production and does not directly relate to the phenomenon described.
  B: This statement is about the wholesale price per pound of beef and bread, but it does not directly relate to the phenomenon described.
  C: This statement provides information about the cost of producing bread and beef, but it does not directly relate to the phenomenon described.
  D: This statement provides information about the proportion of beef sold that is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, but it does not directly relate to the phenomenon described.
  E: This statement provides information about the retail grocery outlets that sell bread and meat, but it does not directly relate to the phenomenon described.
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that if grain prices double, the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling, whereas the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  The difference in price changes could be due to the relative importance of grain in the production of beef and bread.
  If grain is a more significant cost in producing beef than in producing bread, then a doubling of grain prices would have a greater impact on the price of beef.
  If labor and marketing costs are a more significant cost in producing bread than in producing beef, then a doubling of grain prices would have a smaller impact on the price of bread.
  Therefore, the statement that would most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described is C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
Criticism:
  The thought process is logical and the answer is reasonable.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - If grain prices double, the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  - If grain prices double, the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Choices:
  A: This statement is about labor costs in cattle production and does not explain the phenomenon described above.
  B: This statement provides information about the wholesale price of beef and bread, but it does not explain why the price of beef would come close to doubling while the price of bread would only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  C: This statement provides information about the cost of producing bread and beef, but it does not explain why the price of beef would come close to doubling while the price of bread would only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  D: This statement provides information about the proportion of beef produced from cattle fed on grass versus grain, but it does not explain why the price of beef would come close to doubling while the price of bread would only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  E: This statement provides information about the retail grocery outlets that sell bread and meat, but it does not explain why the price of beef would come close to doubling while the price of bread would only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
Thought:
  The phenomenon described above is that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling while the average price of a loaf of bread will only rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double.
  This suggests that the cost of grain is a much larger factor in the cost of producing beef than it is in the cost of producing bread.
  Therefore, the statement that would most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above is C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
Criticism:
  The thought process is correct in that the cost of grain is a much larger factor in the cost of producing beef than it is in the cost of producing bread. 
  However, the statement in choice C is not entirely accurate. While the cost of feeding cattle is a significant factor in the cost of producing beef, it is not the only factor. Other factors such as labor, marketing, and processing costs also contribute to the cost of producing beef.

  E: This statement provides information about the retail grocery outlets that purchase bread and meat, but it does not explain the phenomenon described above.
Thought:
  The phenomenon described above is that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling, while the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  The difference in price increase could be due to the difference in the cost of producing beef and bread.
  If the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef, then a doubling of grain prices would have a significant impact on the cost of producing beef.
  If the labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, then a doubling of grain prices would have a smaller impact on the cost of producing bread.
  Therefore, C is the most likely answer.
Criticism:
  The statement in choice C is a possible explanation, but it is not the only possible explanation.
  Other factors, such as supply and demand, could also contribute to the phenomenon described above.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion
  D: appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute
  E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply

  The answer is B: it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale.
Criticism: 
  There is no support in the dialogue for the claim that the rug store in Glendale sold rugs of inferior quality (A).
  The dialogue is about whether it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale, not whether it is possible to determine the market for rugs in Glendale (C).
  The dialogue does not provide any information about whether any other stores have gone out of business in Glendale (D).
  The dialogue supports the claim that rug stores can close because of insufficient demand for rugs, but this is not what Mario and Renate disagree about (E).

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether or not H pylori should be considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that just because H pylori does not cause stomach ulcers in all people, it should not be considered a commensal.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that just because H pylori does not cause stomach ulcers in all people, it should not be considered a commensal.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  This statement shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid because H pylori allegedly strengthens immune response, while M tuberculosis does not provide any benefits.
  Therefore, choice C most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether Helicobacter pylori should be considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that since only a small percentage of people with H pylori get stomach ulcers, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, it should be considered a commensal.
  The argument compares H pylori to Mycobacter tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis.
  The argument claims that even though only a small percentage of people with M tuberculosis get sick from it, no one would call it a commensal.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  However, the argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis, but is not considered a commensal.
  The argument assumes that the only reason H pylori is considered a commensal is because it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  However, the argument does not consider other possible reasons why H pylori might be considered a commensal.
  Therefore, the answer choice that most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning is the one that provides an alternative reason why H pylori might be considered a commensal.
  Choice C provides an alternative reason why H pylori might not be considered a commensal, which undermines the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether Helicobacter pylori should be considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that just because only a small percentage of people with H pylori get stomach ulcers, and it allegedly strengthens immune response, it should not be considered a commensal.
  The argument uses the example of Mycobacter tuberculosis to support its claim.
  A: The effectiveness of antibiotics in treating stomach ulcers and tuberculosis is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The duration of tuberculosis and ulcers is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement supports the argument's claim that M tuberculosis should not be considered a commensal, but it does not undermine the argument's reasoning.
  D: The number of people who harbor M tuberculosis and H pylori is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that H pylori is more common than M tuberculosis, which could explain why fewer people get stomach ulcers from H pylori than get sick from M tuberculosis.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that just because only a small percentage of people with H pylori get stomach ulcers, and it allegedly strengthens immune response, it should not be considered a commensal.
  The argument uses the example of Mycobacter tuberculosis to support its claim.
  If there are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis, then it is possible that fewer people get stomach ulcers from H pylori simply because it is less common.
  This would undermine the argument's reasoning that H pylori should not be considered a commensal.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. 
  This statement undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that H pylori is more common than M tuberculosis, which could explain why fewer people get stomach ulcers from H pylori than get sick from M tuberculosis.
Response 3:

  The argument claims that even though only a small percentage of people with M tuberculosis get sick from it, no one would call it a commensal.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  However, the argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis but is not considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that even though only a small percentage of people with M tuberculosis get sick from it, no one would call it a commensal.
  Therefore, the argument implies that the fact that only a small percentage of people with H pylori get stomach ulcers is not enough to consider it a commensal.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the fact that only a small percentage of people with H pylori get stomach ulcers is enough to consider it a commensal.
  Answer choice C suggests that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which is irrelevant to the argument.
  Answer choices A, B, D, and E are also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices seriously undermines the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether H pylori can be considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that just because only a small percentage of people get sick from M tuberculosis, it cannot be considered a commensal.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.

  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find an answer choice that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Answer choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  This undermines the argument's reasoning because it shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it allegedly strengthens immune response, but M tuberculosis does not provide any benefits to the host.
  However, answer choice C shows that M tuberculosis also does not provide any benefits to the host, which weakens the argument's claim that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal.
  Therefore, answer choice C is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether Helicobacter pylori should be considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that since only a small percentage of people with H pylori get stomach ulcers, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, it should be considered a commensal.
  The argument then compares this to Mycobacter tuberculosis, which only a small percentage of people get sick from, but is not considered a commensal.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  However, this is not a good argument because M tuberculosis also causes disease in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed and needs to be undermined.
  Choice C undermines the argument by stating that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which is different from H pylori.
Criticism: 
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument and does not undermine the reasoning.
  Choice B is also not relevant to the argument and does not undermine the reasoning.
  Choice D and E are also not relevant to the argument and do not undermine the reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")

  D: The number of people who harbor M tuberculosis and H pylori is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that H pylori is more likely to be a commensal than M tuberculosis.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that just because only a small percentage of people who harbor H pylori get stomach ulcers, it does not mean that H pylori is a commensal.
  The argument uses the example of M tuberculosis to support its claim.
  If there are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis, then it is more likely that H pylori is a commensal.
  Therefore, E undermines the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.

  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that just because only a small percentage of people get sick from M tuberculosis, it should not be considered a commensal.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find an answer choice that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Answer choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  This undermines the argument's reasoning because it shows that M tuberculosis is not a commensal, not because only a small percentage of people get sick from it, but because it provides no benefit to the host.
  This invalidates the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis and undermines the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  A: The effectiveness of antibiotics in treating stomach ulcers and tuberculosis is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  B: The duration of cases of tuberculosis and ulcers caused by H pylori is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning by suggesting that M tuberculosis does not provide any benefits to those who harbor it.
  D: The number of people who harbor M tuberculosis or H pylori is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  If it can be shown that H pylori provides benefits to those who harbor it, despite causing stomach ulcers in some people, then the argument's reasoning would be undermined.
  Therefore, the most serious undermining statement would be one that suggests that H pylori provides benefits to those who harbor it.
Analysis: 
  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement supports the argument's reasoning by suggesting that M tuberculosis does not provide any benefits to those who harbor it.

  The argument is about whether Helicobacter pylori should be considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to Mycobacter tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis.
  The argument claims that no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal, even though only about 10% of people who harbor it get sick from it.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  However, the fact that only some people get sick from a bacterium does not necessarily mean that it is not a commensal.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that suggests that H pylori is more like a commensal than the argument suggests.
  Choice C suggests that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which implies that M tuberculosis is not a commensal.
  However, the argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens immune response, which suggests that the presence of a bacterium can be beneficial even if it causes some harm.
  Therefore, choice C does not undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E suggests that more people harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis, but this fact does not necessarily affect whether H pylori should be considered a commensal.
  Therefore, choice E does not undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A suggests that both stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can be effectively treated with antibiotics, which implies that the harm caused by H pylori can be eliminated.
  This fact weakens the argument's claim that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  Therefore, choice A undermines the argument's reasoning.
Criticism: 
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  However, the fact that only some people get sick from a bacterium does not necessarily mean that it is not a commensal.
  The argument also compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, but the two bacteria may have different relationships with their hosts.
  The argument does not consider the possibility that the harm caused by H pylori can be eliminated with antibiotics.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

Thought: 
  The question asks which of the following casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  If the evidence is not valid, then the polar bear may not have navigated over considerable distances.
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory. This does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, as the polar bear may have still navigated over considerable distances.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This supports the naturalists' claim, as the polar bear may have used its navigation abilities to return to its home territory.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice. This does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, as the polar bear may have still navigated over considerable distances.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances. This casts doubt on the validity of the evidence, as the polar bear may have found its way home through means other than navigation.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory. This does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, as the polar bear may have still navigated over considerable distances.

  If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it would suggest that the bear was able to return home because it was already familiar with the area.
  If the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, it would not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  If polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, it would not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  If polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, it would not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document
  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known

  The flaw is that the journalist does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret.
  A representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed on the document.
Thought: 
  The journalist reasons that because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is not a member of the trade group.
  However, the journalist's reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the document names every member of the trade group.
  It is possible that the document is incomplete or that there are other ways to become a member of the trade group that do not involve being listed on the document.
  Therefore, the journalist's argument is flawed because it does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
Thought:
  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity could explain why they have a lower life expectancy in captivity than in the wild.
  However, the statement says that the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both cases.
  Therefore, there must be some other factor that is balancing out the negative effects of captivity on leatherbacks.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why leatherbacks in captivity are not dying earlier than those in the wild.
Evaluation:
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy. Whether other aquatic reptiles are more or less susceptible to diseases than leatherbacks does not explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy. The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general does not explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  C: This statement suggests that predators are a major cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild. If this is true, then it is possible that leatherbacks in captivity are not dying earlier than those in the wild because they are not being attacked by predators. This could help to resolve the discrepancy.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy. Whether zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks does not explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy. Whether the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age does not explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
Thought:
  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity suggests that they would not live as long in captivity as they would in the wild.
  However, the fact that leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild suggests that captivity does not have a negative effect on their lifespan.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between these two facts.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why captivity does not have a negative effect on the lifespan of leatherbacks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice C suggests that predators are a major cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild, which could explain why their lifespan is not significantly longer in the wild than in captivity.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators. 
Action: Answer("C")

Evaluation:
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  C: This statement suggests that predators are a major cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild, which could explain why the life expectancy is similar in both cases.
  D: This statement suggests that it is difficult to create a suitable environment for captive leatherbacks, which could explain why they are not living as long as those in the wild.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
Thought: 
  There is an apparent discrepancy between the fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity and yet have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  Option A is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Option C suggests that predators are the main cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild, which could explain why the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  Option D is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
Criticism: 
  The answer is reasonable, but it is not conclusive.
  There could be other factors that explain why the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
Thought:
  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity suggests that they would have a shorter lifespan in captivity than in the wild.
  However, the fact that they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild suggests that captivity does not have a negative impact on their lifespan.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between these two facts.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why captivity does not have a negative impact on their lifespan.
Evaluation:
  A: This fact is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  B: This fact is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  C: This fact suggests that predators are a major cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild, which could explain why their lifespan is not significantly longer in the wild than in captivity.
  D: This fact is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  E: This fact is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.

  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity suggests that they would not live as long in captivity as they would in the wild.
  However, the fact that leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild suggests that captivity does not have a negative impact on their lifespan.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between these two facts.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why captivity does not have a negative impact on the lifespan of leatherbacks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice C suggests that predators are a major cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild, which could explain why they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice D suggests that zoologists may not be able to create a suitable environment for captive leatherbacks, which would suggest that captivity is not a good option for leatherbacks.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
Criticism:
  Choice D could also help to resolve the discrepancy by suggesting that the conditions of captivity are not suitable for leatherbacks, but this is less directly related to the discrepancy than choice C.
Action: Answer("C")

  There is an apparent discrepancy between these two facts.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why captivity does not have a negative impact on the lifespan of leatherbacks.
Evaluation:
  A: This fact is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  B: This fact is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  C: This fact suggests that leatherbacks in the wild are more likely to die from predation than from disease, which could explain why captivity does not have a negative impact on their lifespan.
  D: This fact is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  E: This fact is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: History provides many examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable. This shows that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: People correctly believe that technological innovations often cause job loss.
  B: People are often reluctant to take on new challenges.
  C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
  D: People tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations.
  E: People correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well

  The argument is about Harrold Foods attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign.
  Survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market.
  Any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market.
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
  The argument uses the survey results to support the conclusion.
  However, the survey results only show the opinion of the consumers and not the actual sales data.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The argument assumes that the opinion of the consumers is enough to guarantee that Harrold Foods dominates the market.
  This is not necessarily true as the actual sales data may differ from the consumer opinion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the soft-drink market because "Hero" has more than 50% of the sales.
  The survey results show that 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market.
Thought:
  The argument assumes that the market is defined by sales alone and that Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero" has more than 50% of the sales.
  The survey results show that 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market, but this does not necessarily mean that Harrold Foods dominates the market.
  The argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  Therefore, the answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Criticism:
  The analysis is correct. The argument assumes that sales alone define the market and that Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero" has more than 50% of the sales. However, the argument fails to consider other factors that may affect the market, such as the presence of other competitors or changes in consumer preferences. Therefore, the argument's conclusion is not necessarily valid.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.

  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened, but it actually increased. Therefore, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  A: The argument states that if the valley people had been invaded or if there had been a climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Therefore, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: The argument states that many people fear that if the opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: The argument states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Therefore, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: The argument states that city residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels if the battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: The argument states that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Therefore, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Thought: 
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened, but it actually increased. Therefore, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason for the increase in inflation rate is the party's economic theories being off the mark.
  Similarly, in option C, the argument assumes that the only reason for the stock price not increasing is the company's failure to sell its subsidiaries.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in option C most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above.

However, the stock price did not increase, so the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Criticism: 
  The reasoning in option A is flawed because it assumes that the absence of changes in the valley's architecture means that the valley people were not invaded. This is not necessarily true, as there could be other reasons why the architecture remained the same. 
  The reasoning in option B is flawed because it assumes that the workers' promise not to strike means that they do not believe the opposition party will keep its promise of a wage cut. This is not necessarily true, as the workers could have other reasons for not striking. 
  The reasoning in option D is flawed because it assumes that the rebels won the battle because city residents showed a great deal of support for them. This is not necessarily true, as there could be other reasons why city residents are showing support for the rebels. 
  The reasoning in option E is flawed because it assumes that the new weather forecasting equipment is no improvement on the old simply because the station's ratings decreased. This is not necessarily true, as there could be other factors affecting the station's ratings.

  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The argument infers that the party's economic theories were flawed because the inflation rate increased instead of decreasing.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument is inferring causation from correlation.
  The argument assumes that the party's economic theories were the only factor that could have affected the inflation rate.
  The argument does not consider other factors that could have affected the inflation rate, such as external economic factors or implementation issues.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Response 0:

  The columnist argues that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will not be passed into law because those who would be adversely affected are very influential.
  A: This principle states that any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights. This principle does not support the columnist's argument.
  B: This principle states that any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law if the democracy is well-functioning. This principle supports the columnist's argument.
  C: This principle states that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. This principle does not support the columnist's argument.
  D: This principle states that any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights. This principle does not support the columnist's argument.
  E: This principle states that a bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights. This principle does not support the columnist's argument.

  Therefore, the answer is B.
Criticism: 
  The columnist's argument assumes that the democracy is not well-functioning because a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will not be passed into law because those who would be adversely affected are very influential.
  However, Principle B states that if a democracy is well-functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  The columnist's argument does not necessarily contradict Principle B, but it does assume that the democracy is not well-functioning.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have had six fingers per hand if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  A: This statement does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.

  E: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have had six fingers per hand if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  The statement that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices supports the biologist's argument.
  If our perception of the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not based on objective facts, then it is possible that we could be just as content with a different configuration.
  Therefore, D is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")

  The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if we had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
  If our perception of the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not based on objective facts, but rather on our prejudices, then it is possible that we could be just as content with a different configuration of fingers.
  Therefore, D most strengthens the biologist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if they had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
- The biologist argues that the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not objectively superior to other possible configurations.
Thought:
- The biologist's argument is that humans could have been content with a different configuration of fingers.
- If there is evidence that humans are content with different configurations of fingers, this would support the biologist's argument.
- Choice A does not provide evidence that humans are content with different configurations of fingers.
- Choice B is not relevant to the argument.
- Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
- Choice D supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not based on objective facts.
- Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
- Therefore, the best answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Criticism:
- The argument is based on the assumption that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if they had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins. This assumption may not be true.
- The argument assumes that the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not objectively superior to other possible configurations. This assumption may not be true.

- The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if they had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
- The biologist argues that the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not objectively superior to other possible configurations.
Thought:
- The biologist's argument is that humans could have been content with a different configuration of fingers if they had evolved from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
- Therefore, the biologist's argument would be strengthened if there were evidence that humans have been content with other configurations of fingers in the past.
- Choice A does not strengthen the argument because it does not provide evidence that humans have been content with other configurations of fingers in the past.
- Choice B does not strengthen the argument because it makes a generalization about human behavior that is not necessarily true.
- Choice C does not strengthen the argument because it makes a generalization about human behavior that is not necessarily true.
- Choice D is consistent with the biologist's argument, but it does not provide evidence that humans have been content with other configurations of fingers in the past.
- Choice E provides evidence that at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins, which supports the biologist's argument that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if they had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
Criticism:
- The argument is not about whether humans could have had a different configuration of fingers, but whether they would be content with a different configuration.
- The argument assumes that humans are content with their current configuration of fingers, but it does not provide evidence that this is the case.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:

  A: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective facts.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans could have evolved to have six fingers if a fish with six phalanges in its fins had been our ancestor.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have evolved to have a different number of fingers if our ancestor had a different number of phalanges in its fins.
  Statement D suggests that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective facts.
  Therefore, the biologist's argument is strengthened by statement D.
  The answer is D.
Criticism: 
  The argument is not necessarily about the usefulness of our fingers, but rather about the possibility of humans having a different number of fingers.
  Statement D may not necessarily strengthen the argument, as it is not directly related to the argument.

  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not necessarily accurate.
  E: This statement supports the biologist's argument that it is possible for a fish to have six phalanges in its fins.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the best or most useful configuration.
  If it is possible for a fish to have six phalanges in its fins, then it is possible for humans to have six fingers on each hand.
  If our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not necessarily accurate, then we could be just as content with six fingers on each hand.
  Therefore, the statement that most strengthens the biologist's argument is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic or reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Dried parsley should never be used in cooking, for it is far less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley is.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most clearly helps to justify the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
  B: Only the tastiest ingredients should ever be used in cooking.
  C: Ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful.
  D: Parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking.
  E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
Thought:
  The argument is based on the premise that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  The principle that would most clearly help to justify this argument is that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
Criticism:
  The argument does not claim that only fresh ingredients should be used in cooking, but rather that dried parsley is inferior to fresh parsley.
  Therefore, while A may be a valid principle, it is not the most clearly justifying the argument above.

  The argument is not based on the principle that only the tastiest ingredients should ever be used in cooking, as this is too subjective and not necessarily related to healthfulness.
  The argument is also not based on the principle that parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking, as this is circular reasoning.
  The argument is not based on the principle that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful, as this is too broad and not necessarily true.
  The argument is not based on the principle that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients in general, as this is too broad and not necessarily true for all ingredients.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  A: This principle suggests that fresh ingredients should be used whenever possible, but it does not directly address the argument about dried parsley.
  B: This principle suggests that only the tastiest ingredients should be used, but it does not directly address the argument about dried parsley.
  C: This principle suggests that ingredients that should never be used are generally neither tasty nor healthful, which supports the argument about dried parsley.

  The argument is based on the premise that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  The principle that would most clearly help to justify this argument is that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
Criticism:
  The argument does not claim that only fresh ingredients should be used in cooking, but rather that dried parsley is inferior to fresh parsley.
  Therefore, the principle that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible is not the most clear justification for the argument.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The detective presumes that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary.
  The detective argues that an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  Therefore, it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Thought:
  A: If the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized by supervisors, it would make it less likely that one of them would be the embezzler. This weakens the detective's argument.
  B: If persons outside XYZ Corporation had access to internal financial records, it would mean that the embezzler could have been someone other than an accountant or an actuary. This weakens the detective's argument.
  C: The fact that there are more accountants than actuaries does not necessarily weaken the detective's argument.
  D: The fact that an independent report concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement does not necessarily weaken the detective's argument.
  E: If it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records, it would make it less likely that one of them would be the embezzler. This weakens the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

  The detective presumes that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary.
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
Thought:
  A: If the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized, it would make it less likely that one of them could have embezzled money. This weakens the detective's argument.
  B: If someone outside the corporation had access to the financial records, it would mean that the embezzler could have been anyone with access to the records. This weakens the detective's argument.
  C: The fact that there are more accountants than actuaries does not necessarily weaken the detective's argument.
  D: The fact that an independent report concluded that the corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement does not necessarily weaken the detective's argument.
  E: If it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to the records, it would make it less likely that one of them could have embezzled money. This weakens the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.

  A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants, then it is less likely that one of the actuaries would have been able to embezzle money without being caught. This weakens the detective's argument.
  B: If there is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records, then it is possible that the embezzler was not an employee of XYZ Corporation. This weakens the detective's argument.
  C: If there are more accountants than actuaries on staff, then it is more likely that the embezzler was an accountant. This weakens the detective's argument.

  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that supports the detective's argument.
  A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants, then it is less likely that an actuary would have been able to embezzle money without being detected.
  B: If persons outside XYZ Corporation had access to internal financial records, then it is possible that the embezzler was not an accountant or an actuary.
  C: If there are more accountants than actuaries, then it is more likely that the embezzler was an accountant.
  D: If an independent report concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement, then it is possible that the embezzler was not an accountant or an actuary.
  E: If certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, then it is less likely that an actuary would have been able to embezzle money without being detected.

  B: If someone outside the corporation had access to the records, it could have been someone other than an accountant or actuary, so this weakens the detective's argument.
  C: The number of accountants versus actuaries does not necessarily weaken the detective's argument.
  D: The fact that the corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement does not necessarily weaken the detective's argument.
  E: If it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to the records, it would make it less likely that one of them was the embezzler, so this weakens the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.

Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Movie executives aim to maximize the number of people who see a film to generate revenues from ticket sales.
  Television executives do not aim to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
    This choice does not explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
    This choice does not explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
    This choice explains the difference in goals between movie and television executives. Movie executives need to maximize the number of people who see a film to generate revenues from ticket sales to cover the high cost of producing a film. Television executives do not have the same high production costs, so they do not need to maximize the number of viewers to generate revenues.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
    This choice does not explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
Thought: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film because the more people who see a film, the more revenue they generate from ticket sales.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows because they make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  Therefore, the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives is that movie executives are concerned with maximizing the number of people who see a film, while television executives are concerned with maximizing the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  Choice D most helps to explain this difference because it states that television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
Criticism: 
  There is no direct evidence in the passage that supports the idea that television executives are concerned with maximizing the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  While it is true that television shows make their profits from sponsors, it is not clear that this is the reason why television executives are not concerned with maximizing the number of viewers for their shows.
  Therefore, the answer may not be D.

  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows because they make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  Therefore, the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives is that movie executives are concerned with maximizing the number of people who see a film, while television executives are concerned with maximizing the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

  Option A is not relevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option B is not relevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option C is relevant, but it does not explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option D is relevant because it explains that television shows make their profits from sponsors who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. This means that television executives are more concerned with the demographics of their audience than the number of viewers.
  Option E is not relevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. 
Criticism:
  None.

Thought: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film because the more people who see a film, the more revenue the film generates from ticket sales.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows because the revenue of television shows comes from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  Therefore, the answer should explain why the revenue of television shows comes from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  Choice D explains that television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
Criticism: 
  The explanation in the thought process is correct.
  However, it is possible that the revenue of television shows comes from other sources as well, such as subscription fees or advertising revenue.
  Therefore, while choice D may help explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and television executives, it may not be the only factor.

Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person has an immunity to a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms.
  The student argues that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms.
Thought:
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity to staphylococcus.
  However, it is possible for someone to be exposed to staphylococcus and not develop harmful symptoms without having immunity to staphylococcus.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  Both arguments make an assumption that is not necessarily true.

  Option B is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
  Option D is flawed because it assumes that the recent decline in business expansions is solely due to excessive taxation, which is not necessarily true.
  Option E is flawed because it assumes that doctors' hand-washing practices are the only factor affecting the spread of disease, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person has an immunity to a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. 
  The student then argues that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms.
Thought:
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to the microorganism. 
  However, it is possible that the person has not been exposed to a harmful strain of the microorganism or that their immune system was able to fight off the infection without developing symptoms.
  This flawed pattern of reasoning is most similar to option C, which assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and therefore, Isabel must not have taken the medication because she is still ill.
Criticism: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to the microorganism.

  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to the microorganism.
  This is similar to option C, which assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and therefore, Isabel must not have taken the medication because she is still ill.
Criticism: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to the microorganism.
  However, some people may not develop symptoms because they have a strong immune system, not necessarily because they have an immunity to the microorganism.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person has an immunity to a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. 
  The student also argues that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms.
Thought:
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity to the microorganism. 
  However, this assumption is not necessarily true because some people may have developed harmful symptoms in the past, but have since recovered and are now immune.
  This flawed pattern of reasoning is most similar to option C, which assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and therefore, Isabel must not have taken the medication because she is still ill.
  Both arguments make unwarranted assumptions based on incomplete information.
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.

  This assumption is not necessarily true, as the physician may be able to provide legitimate grounds for denying the claim even if he has personal reasons to deny it.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  The answer is D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
Criticism: 
  I cannot think of any significant criticism of this answer.

  E: The research relates to practical concerns, so it meets the university president's principle.
  Therefore, the principle stated by the university president most helps to justify funding for the research investigation into the mathematical properties of folded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease. The answer is E.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. The university president believes that research institutions have an obligation to promote research in any field of theoretical investigation if that research shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life. The research investigation into the mathematical properties of folded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease meets this principle.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

Knowledge: 
  The evolution of the anatomically modern human brain required a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats.
  Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans.
  The human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Thought: 
  There is a conflict between the fact that the high-calorie diet required for the evolution of the human brain was most abundant and reliable in shore environments, but the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find a statement that explains why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas despite the fact that shore environments had the most abundant and reliable food resources for the high-calorie diet required for the evolution of the human brain.
  Option A is irrelevant to the conflict presented above.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the conflict presented above.
  Option C does not explain why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas despite the fact that shore environments had the most abundant and reliable food resources for the high-calorie diet required for the evolution of the human brain.
  Option D is irrelevant to the conflict presented above.
  Option E explains that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. This statement suggests that although shore environments had the most abundant and reliable food resources for the high-calorie diet required for the evolution of the human brain, gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in savanna and woodland areas. Therefore, early humans may have preferred to gather food in savanna and woodland areas to conserve energy, even though the food resources in those areas were less abundant and reliable for the high-calorie diet required for the evolution of the human brain.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Sarah: When commercial fishing boats with permits to fish for certain species accidentally catch a type of fish for which they have no permit, the latter must be thrown back. This is a very wasteful practice because many, if not most, of the rejected fish do not survive. Fishing permits should therefore be altered so that fishers can keep fish caught accidentally. Amar: Making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more "accidents."
Question: The technique Amar uses in responding to Sarah's argument is to
Choices:
  A: question whether Sarah's recommendation can be put into practice
  B: point out that Sarah used a crucial term in two distinct senses
  C: allude to a factor that supposedly strengthens the case for Sarah's recommendation
  D: contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence
  E: maintain that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

Knowledge: 
  Carpal tunnel syndrome is a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists.
  Repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard can cause carpal tunnel syndrome.
  A recent study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Thought: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need to find an option that explains why this is the case.
  Option A suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work. This option does not explain why workers with less control over their work are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option B suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This option provides a possible explanation for the study's findings, as it suggests that the emotional stress caused by a lack of control over one's work may make workers more susceptible to developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option C suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This option does not explain why workers with less control over their work are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option D suggests that among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work. This option is not relevant to the study's findings, as the study only looked at office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  Option E suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This option does not explain why workers with less control over their work are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option B provides a possible explanation for the study's findings, so it is the best answer.

Choices:
  A: This choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work. This does not explain the study's findings that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  B: This choice suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This helps to explain the study's findings that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control. If feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders, then it makes sense that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  C: This choice suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This does not explain the study's findings that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  D: This choice suggests that among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work. This does not explain the study's findings that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  E: This choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This does not explain the study's findings that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Thought: 
  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Choice B suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  If feeling a lack of control over one's own work puts one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders, then it makes sense that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
Criticism: 
  This answer seems reasonable and there are no major flaws in the logic or reasoning.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that the recent concert was probably not properly promoted because it did not sell out, despite Wells' belief that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
Thought: 
  Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, believed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  This pattern of reasoning involves a prediction based on a condition, and then using the absence of the predicted outcome to infer the absence of the condition.
  The argument is most similar to option A, which involves a prediction based on a condition (the patient surviving the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon), and then using the absence of the predicted outcome (the patient surviving the surgery) to infer the absence of the condition (the surgery being properly performed).
Criticism: 
  The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason the concert did not sell out is because it was poorly promoted. There could be other factors that contributed to the low ticket sales, such as the ticket prices being too high or the artist not being popular in that area. Therefore, the argument's conclusion is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument suggests that Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, believed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. However, the concert did not sell out, leading to the conclusion that it was probably not properly promoted.
Thought: 
  Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, believed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, it was probably not properly promoted.
  This is similar to option C, where the neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, believed that the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. However, the repair was not properly done, leading to the conclusion that the repair was probably not properly done.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")

  E: The argument states that Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. Since the tests did find lead in the soil, they were probably properly conducted.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which an expert in a particular field makes a prediction about a certain outcome based on their knowledge and expertise. 
  The prediction is then evaluated based on whether or not the outcome occurred. 
  If the outcome did not occur, it is assumed that the prediction was incorrect and that something went wrong in the process.
  The pattern of reasoning in option A is similar to that in the argument above.
  Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, made a prediction about the patient's survival based on the surgeon's skill. 
  The patient did not survive the surgery, so it is assumed that the prediction was incorrect and that something went wrong in the process.
Criticism: 
  The pattern of reasoning in option B is not similar to that in the argument above. 
  The argument in option B is based on a conditional statement, whereas the argument above is based on an expert's prediction.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that the recent concert was probably not properly promoted because it did not sell out, despite the expectation that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  A: The argument concludes that the heart transplant was probably not properly performed because the patient did not survive, despite the expectation that the patient would survive if the surgery were performed by a highly skilled surgeon.
  B: The argument concludes that the sample is probably not labeled correctly because it probably does not contain any organic compounds, based on the knowledge of Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry.
  C: The argument concludes that the repair to the wall was probably not properly done because the damage is still noticeable, despite the expectation that it would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired, based on the knowledge of the experienced home renovator.
  D: The argument concludes that the builder was probably wrong because the school's roof is already leaking, despite the expectation that it would not require repairs for years unless it is damaged in a storm, based on the knowledge of the builder.
  E: The argument concludes that the tests were probably properly conducted because they found lead in the soil, as expected based on the knowledge of Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject.
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that the recent concert was probably not properly promoted because it did not sell out, despite the expectation that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  This is similar to the pattern of reasoning in option C, which concludes that the repair to the wall was probably not properly done because the damage is still noticeable, despite the expectation that it would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired, based on the knowledge of the experienced home renovator.
  Both arguments have an expectation of a certain outcome based on the knowledge of an expert, and conclude that the expected outcome did not occur, therefore the process leading to the outcome was probably not done properly.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which someone who is knowledgeable about a particular subject makes a prediction about an outcome based on certain conditions. If those conditions are not met, the opposite outcome is expected.
  A: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a prediction is made about an outcome based on certain conditions. If those conditions are not met, the opposite outcome is expected.
  B: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a prediction is made about an outcome based on certain conditions. However, the opposite outcome is not expected if those conditions are not met.
  C: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a prediction is made about an outcome based on certain conditions. If those conditions are not met, the opposite outcome is expected.
  D: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a prediction is made about an outcome based on certain conditions. However, the opposite outcome is not expected if those conditions are not met.
  E: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a prediction is made about an outcome based on certain conditions. If those conditions are met, the predicted outcome is expected.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which someone who is knowledgeable about a particular subject makes a prediction about an outcome based on certain conditions. If those conditions are not met, the opposite outcome is expected.
  A presents a similar pattern of reasoning in which a prediction is made about an outcome based on certain conditions. If those conditions are not met, the opposite outcome is expected.
  B presents a different pattern of reasoning in which a prediction is made about an outcome based on certain conditions, but the opposite outcome is not expected if those conditions are not met.
  C presents a similar pattern of reasoning in which a prediction is made about an outcome based on certain conditions. If those conditions are not met, the opposite outcome is expected.
  D presents a different pattern of reasoning in which a prediction is made about an outcome based on certain conditions, but the opposite outcome is not expected if those conditions are not met.
  E presents a different pattern of reasoning in which a prediction is made about an outcome based on certain conditions. If those conditions are met, the predicted outcome is expected.
  A is the most similar pattern of reasoning to the argument above.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant flaw in the argument or the thought process.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that the recent concert was probably not properly promoted because it did not sell out.
  Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, believed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
Thought: 
  Wells believed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  This is similar to option C, where the neighbor believed that the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired, but since the damage is still noticeable, the repair was probably not properly done.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that the recent concert was probably not properly promoted because it did not sell out.
  Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, believed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
Thought: 
  Wells believed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  This is similar to option B, where Professor Willis believed that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds, and concluded that the sample was not labeled correctly.
  Both arguments use an expert's belief about a condition that must be met for a certain outcome to occur, and then conclude that the condition was not met because the outcome did not occur.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and then concludes that the opposite outcome occurred because the necessary conditions were not met.
  A: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and then concludes that the opposite outcome occurred because the necessary conditions were not met.

  D: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and then concludes that the opposite outcome occurred because the necessary conditions were not met.
  E: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and then concludes that the predicted outcome occurred because the necessary conditions were met.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and then concludes that the opposite outcome occurred because the necessary conditions were not met.
  A, B, C, and D all follow this pattern of reasoning.
  E presents a different pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and then concludes that the predicted outcome occurred because the necessary conditions were met.
  Therefore, the pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above is A, B, C, or D.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to be made.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that the concert was probably not properly promoted because it did not sell out.
  Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, believed the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
Thought: 
  Wells is knowledgeable about the concert business.
  Wells believed the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  This pattern of reasoning is similar to the one in option C.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. However, the concert did not sell out, suggesting that it was probably not properly promoted.
  A: The argument claims that Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. However, the patient did not survive the surgery, suggesting that it probably was not properly performed.
  B: The argument claims that Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. However, the sample did not contain any organic compounds, suggesting that it is not labeled correctly.
  C: The argument claims that the neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. However, one can still notice the damage, suggesting that the repair to the wall probably was not properly done.
  D: The argument claims that the builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. However, the roof is already leaking, suggesting that the builder was probably wrong.
  E: The argument claims that Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. The tests did find lead in the soil, suggesting that they were probably properly conducted.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and the failure of that outcome to occur suggests that a certain condition was not met. 
  In this case, Wells predicted that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted, and the fact that it did not sell out suggests that it was probably not properly promoted.
  The pattern of reasoning in option A is similar, as Dr. Smith predicted that the patient would survive the heart transplant if it were properly performed, and the fact that the patient did not survive suggests that the surgery was probably not properly performed.
  The other options do not follow this pattern of reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed. 
Criticism: 
  The pattern of reasoning in option E is also similar, as Professor Yanakita predicted that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted, and the fact that the tests did find lead suggests that they were probably properly conducted.
  However, the argument in the question is more focused on the failure of an outcome to occur, while the argument in option E is more focused on the success of an outcome to occur.
  Therefore, option A is still the best answer.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear.
  A: This criticism suggests that the argument is based on a small sample size and may not be representative of all Kodiak bears.
  B: This criticism suggests that the argument fails to consider other factors that may contribute to the behavior of walking on hind legs.
  C: This criticism suggests that the argument uses the term "behavior" inconsistently or in a way that is misleading.
  D: This criticism suggests that the argument assumes that there are only two ways to explain behavior, which may not be accurate.
  E: This criticism suggests that the argument relies too heavily on the authority of science to support its conclusion.
Thought:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear.
  The criticism that the argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion is not applicable because the argument does not rely on a small sample size.
  The criticism that the argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity is a valid criticism.
  The criticism that the word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument is not applicable because the argument consistently uses the term "behavior" to refer to walking on hind legs.
  The criticism that the argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways is not applicable because the argument does not make this assumption.

  This is because the survey results indicate that most physicians believe that their own choices are not influenced by gifts, but most other physicians' choices are influenced by gifts.
  Therefore, some physicians must be mistaken about their own level of influence or the level of influence on other physicians.
  The answer is C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.
  The survey results suggest that there is a discrepancy between physicians' beliefs about their own level of influence and the level of influence on other physicians.
  This could be due to a variety of factors, such as cognitive biases or social pressures.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that some physicians are mistaken about the degree of influence of drug companies' gifts.

  Most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  The majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts.
Thought: 
  If the survey results are accurate, then it must be true that:
  - Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  This is because the survey results show a contradiction between physicians' beliefs about their own prescription choices and their beliefs about other physicians' prescription choices. If most physicians believe that their own choices are not influenced by gifts, but most believe that other physicians' choices are influenced, then some physicians must be mistaken about one or both of these beliefs.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic or reasoning used to arrive at the answer.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

  The assumption required by the argument is that the design of front-loading washers is different from the design of top-loading washers in a way that affects the dissolving of detergent.
  Choice B reflects this assumption.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester has not received a raise, so it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation.
Question: The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
  B: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  C: My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house. Since anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own it.
  D: My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Since no one who lives in a house both O'WIlS it and pays rent on it, it must be that my next-door neighbors pay rent on their heuse.
  E: Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Therefore, it must be that they pay rent on it.
Response 0:

  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
    This argument assumes that Sal's offer was not legitimate. The principle stated above supports the idea that the legitimacy of an offer depends on whether someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest. Therefore, this argument is justified by the principle.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism of the principle stated above.

    This argument assumes that Joe's offer was legitimate and that Sandy did not believe it to be made in jest. The principle stated in the context supports this assumption. Therefore, this argument is justified.
  Option B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
    This argument assumes that Gus's offer was not legitimate because someone in Kenta's position would reasonably believe it to be made in jest. The principle stated in the context supports this assumption. Therefore, this argument is justified.
  Option C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
    This argument assumes that Frank's offer was legitimate and that Mindy is a reasonable person who will accept it. The principle stated in the context does not directly support or refute this assumption. Therefore, this argument is not justified.
  Option D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
    This argument assumes that Hai's offer was legitimate because no one in Lea's position would reasonably believe it to be made in jest. The principle stated in the context supports this assumption. Therefore, this argument is justified.
  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
    This argument assumes that Sal's offer was not legitimate. The principle stated in the context supports this assumption if someone in Veronica's position would reasonably believe it to be made in jest. However, the argument does not provide any evidence to support this assumption. Therefore, this argument is not justified.
Criticism: 
  The principle stated in the context is not applicable to all situations involving the validity of a contract. For example, an offer may not be legitimate if it is made under duress or if it is illegal. The principle only applies to situations where an offer is not legitimate because someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Thought: 
  The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract. - This argument does not relate to the principle stated above.
  Option B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. - This argument relates to the principle stated above as it shows that the offer was not legitimate as it was made in jest.
  Option C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. - This argument does not relate to the principle stated above.
  Option D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. - This argument relates to the principle stated above as it shows that the offer was legitimate as it was not made in jest.
  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. - This argument relates to the principle stated above as it shows that the offer was not legitimate.
Conclusion: 
  Option B and Option D relate to the principle stated above, but Option B is a better fit as it directly shows an example of an offer not being legitimate as it was made in jest. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Thought: 
  The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A: The argument is valid because Joe made a legitimate offer to Sandy and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  Option B: The argument is valid because Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  Option C: The argument is not valid because the fact that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate does not mean that Mindy, as a reasonable person, will accept the offer.
  Option D: The argument is valid because Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  Option E: The argument is not valid because the principle stated above is not applicable to the situation described in the argument.
Criticism: 
  The principle stated above is applicable to options A, B, D, but not to options C and E.
  Option C is not valid because the fact that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate does not mean that Mindy, as a reasonable person, will accept the offer.
  Option E is not valid because the principle stated above is not applicable to the situation described in the argument.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.

  The medical researcher compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. 
  Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  Therefore, the researcher concludes that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that contradicts the researcher's conclusion.
  Option E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
  If jogging is one of those forms of exercise, then stretching beforehand could still be beneficial.
  Therefore, option E weakens the researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the comparison of two groups of joggers, one that stretches before jogging and one that does not stretch before jogging.
  The argument assumes that the two groups are similar in all other respects except for the stretching.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an alternative explanation for why the two groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  Choice A does not weaken the argument, as it suggests that both groups had a lower rate of jogging injuries than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  Choice B weakens the argument, as it suggests that the group that stretches before jogging may have had more injuries if many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  Choice C weakens the argument, as it suggests that most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  Choice D does not weaken the argument, as it suggests that the habit of performing stretches before jogging is more common among joggers who are more prone to jogging injuries.
  Choice E weakens the argument, as it suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:

Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is based on the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that contradicts this fact.
  A: This option does not weaken the argument, as it suggests that both groups of joggers had a lower rate of jogging injuries than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: This option suggests that many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches. This could mean that the group that stretched before jogging was not able to stretch properly, which could have led to more injuries. This weakens the argument.
  C: This option suggests that most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect. This does not weaken the argument, as it suggests that stretching would not have prevented these injuries.
  D: This option suggests that the more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging. This does not weaken the argument, as it does not contradict the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  E: This option suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise. This does not weaken the argument, as it does not contradict the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
Criticism: 
  Option B is a possible weakness in the argument, as it suggests that the group that stretched before jogging was not able to stretch properly, which could have led to more injuries.

  The argument assumes that both groups of joggers are similar in all other respects except for the stretching.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an alternative explanation for why both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  Choice A does not weaken the argument because it suggests that both groups of joggers had a lower rate of jogging injuries than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument because it suggests that some joggers may have difficulty performing stretches, but it does not explain why both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that most jogging injuries result from mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  Choice D does not weaken the argument because it suggests that joggers who are more prone to jogging injuries are more likely to perform stretches before jogging, which would support the researcher's argument.
  Choice E weakens the argument because it suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer.

  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is based on the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that contradicts this fact.
  Option A states that the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries for both groups of joggers compared by the scientists.
  This means that both groups of joggers had fewer injuries than expected, which could be due to the fact that they were being studied and were more careful.
  Therefore, option A weakens the medical researcher's argument.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer.

  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought:
  The medical researcher compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging.
  Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  Therefore, the medical researcher concluded that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the conclusion.
  A: This statement does not weaken the argument.
  B: This statement suggests that the group of joggers who stretch before jogging may have been at a disadvantage because they had difficulty performing stretches.
  C: This statement suggests that stretching may not be effective in preventing injuries caused by falls, collisions, and other mishaps.
  D: This statement suggests that joggers who are more prone to injuries are more likely to stretch before jogging, which could explain why both groups had roughly the same number of injuries.
  E: This statement suggests that stretching can be effective in preventing injuries for certain forms of exercise.
  Statement B suggests that the group of joggers who stretch before jogging may have been at a disadvantage because they had difficulty performing stretches.
Criticism: 
  Statement C is not relevant to the argument.
  Statement D does not contradict the conclusion.
  Statement E is not relevant to the argument.

Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the comparison of two groups of joggers, one that stretches before jogging and one that does not.
  The argument assumes that the two groups are similar in all other respects.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a reason why the two groups might not be comparable or why stretching might still be beneficial.
  A: This statement does not weaken the argument. It actually strengthens the argument by suggesting that both groups of joggers were less prone to injury than the general population of joggers.
  B: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that the group that did not stretch may have included more previously injured joggers who were unable to stretch.
  C: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that most jogging injuries are not related to flexibility, and therefore stretching may not be expected to prevent them.
  D: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that the group that did not stretch may have included more injury-prone joggers who were unable to develop the habit of stretching.
  E: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that stretching may be beneficial for certain forms of exercise, even if it is not beneficial for jogging.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that suggests that stretching before jogging may have some effect on preventing injuries.
  Option A suggests that both groups of joggers had a lower rate of jogging injuries during the study than the overall rate of jogging injuries. This implies that both groups of joggers were less prone to injuries, which could have masked the effect of stretching. 
  Option B suggests that some joggers may have difficulty performing stretches, which could have affected the results of the study.
  Option C suggests that most jogging injuries result from mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect. This implies that stretching may not be effective in preventing all types of jogging injuries.
  Option D suggests that joggers who are more prone to injuries are more likely to perform stretches before jogging. This implies that stretching may be effective in preventing injuries.
  Option E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise. This implies that stretching may be effective in preventing injuries.
  Option D and E both suggest that stretching may be effective in preventing injuries, so they weaken the medical researcher's argument the most.
Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.

Thought: 
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class, but most of the psychology majors are not.
  However, the argument assumes that the number of sociology majors and psychology majors is equal, which may not be the case.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is most similar to that in option B, which assumes that the number of residents in favor of spending more on roads and parks is equal.
  Both arguments assume that the number of individuals in each group is equal, which may not be the case.

Thought: 
  The argument above assumes that the number of students taking the class is proportional to the number of majors in each field.
  This is a flawed assumption because it is possible that a higher percentage of sociology majors choose to take the class than psychology majors.
  Therefore, the argument's conclusion that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class is not necessarily true.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is most similar to that in option B, which assumes that the number of residents in favor of increased spending on roads is proportional to the number of residents in favor of increased spending on parks.

  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the fact that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  A: The argument concludes that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays based on the fact that most of the paintings on display are from the twentieth century while most of the paintings the museum owns are from the nineteenth century.
  B: The argument concludes that most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks based on the fact that more residents said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than on parks.
  C: The argument concludes that there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species in the San Felipe area based on the fact that most of the trees in the San Felipe city arboretum are of local rather than exotic species.
  D: The argument concludes that more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo based on the fact that most of the vegetables available at Valley Food are organic while most of the vegetables available at Jumbo are not.
  E: The argument concludes that Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale based on the fact that the Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses but of fewer than half of the condominiums that Acme is offering for sale.
Thought: 
  The argument above assumes that the number of students enrolled in the class is proportional to the number of majors in each field.
  This assumption may not be true, as there may be other factors that influence students' decisions to take the class.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is most similar to that in option B, which assumes that the number of residents in favor of increased spending on roads is proportional to the number of residents opposed to increased spending on parks.
  This assumption may not be true, as there may be other factors that influence residents' opinions on spending priorities.
  Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

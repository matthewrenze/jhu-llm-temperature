### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.

  A: This option suggests that the generalization made about the entire group of volunteers may not be true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: This option suggests that the advertisement assumes that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola over other colas tasted, even in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: This option suggests that the advertisement overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This option suggests that the advertisement overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: This option suggests that the study only elicits consumers' responses to colas and not other beverages.
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  However, the study only tested five competing colas, and there may be other colas or beverages that the volunteers would prefer over Sparkle Cola.
  Additionally, the study does not account for factors such as packaging or price that may influence consumers' preferences.
  Therefore, the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds of option D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  A: This option suggests that the study may not be representative of the entire group of volunteers, as each of the five smaller groups may have had different preferences.
  B: This option suggests that the advertisement assumes that the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola over the other colas tasted, even in situations where it is more expensive.
  C: This option suggests that the study may not have tested all possible colas, and that there may be another cola that elicits a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This option suggests that the advertisement overlooks other factors that may influence consumers' preferences, such as packaging or price.
  E: This option suggests that the study may not be generalizable to other types of beverages.
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  Option A suggests that the study may not be representative of the entire group of volunteers, as each of the five smaller groups may have had different preferences. However, the advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the other colas tasted, so this option is not the best criticism.

However, the advertisement does not make any assumptions about the price of Sparkle Cola, so this option is not the best criticism.
  Option C suggests that the study may not have tested all possible colas, and that there may be another cola that elicits a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. This is a valid criticism, as the study only tested five colas, and there may be other colas that are more popular than Sparkle Cola.
  Option D suggests that the advertisement overlooks other factors that may influence consumers' preferences, such as packaging or price. This is a valid criticism, as the study only tested the taste of the colas, and did not take into account other factors that may influence consumers' preferences.
  Option E suggests that the study may not be generalizable to other types of beverages. This is not a valid criticism, as the advertisement only claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than the competing colas tested.
Criticism: 
  Option C and D are both valid criticisms of the advertisement, but option D is the better criticism because it points out that the study only tested the taste of the colas, and did not take into account other factors that may influence consumers' preferences.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is a conditional statement with two premises and a conclusion.
  The first premise states that if squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds.
  The second premise states that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The conclusion states that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Thought: 
  The argument above is an example of a flawed pattern of reasoning called affirming the consequent.
  Affirming the consequent is a logical fallacy that occurs when one assumes that if the consequent of a conditional statement is true, then the antecedent must also be true.
  The argument above assumes that if a bird feeder does not have a protective cover, then squirrels will eat from it, and therefore, it will not attract many birds.
  However, this assumption is flawed because there may be other reasons why a bird feeder does not attract many birds.

  The conclusion is that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Thought: 
  The argument above is an example of a flawed pattern of reasoning called affirming the consequent.
  Affirming the consequent is a logical fallacy that occurs when one assumes that if an "if-then" statement is true and the consequent is true, then the antecedent must be true as well.
  The argument above assumes that if a bird feeder does not have a protective cover, then squirrels will eat from it, and if squirrels eat from it, then it will not attract many birds.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that if a bird feeder does not have a protective cover, then it will not attract many birds.
  However, this conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.
  The correct conclusion would be that if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, then it may attract squirrels and may not attract many birds, but it does not necessarily follow that it will not attract many birds.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in option A.
  Option A assumes that if a tire's pressure is too low, then the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, then a likely cause is that the pressure was too low.
  Therefore, option A concludes that if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, then the tires will not wear out prematurely.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself

Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that the study's conclusion is valid despite the small sample size because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This argument is vulnerable to criticism because the validity of the conclusion depends on the quality of the study, not the reputation of the author.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  The answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  However, it is also possible to criticize the argument on the grounds that it takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole, as the study only looked at six individual chameleons.
  Therefore, the answer could also be A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  Critics of the study doubted its results due to the small sample size.
  The study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  However, this does not address the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument fails to address the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  None of the choices directly address this criticism, but A is the closest.
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole - this is not relevant to the argument.
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun - this is not relevant to the argument.
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself - this is not relevant to the argument.
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise - this is not relevant to the argument.
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics - this is not relevant to the argument.

  The biologist's argument is not addressing the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  Therefore, the argument is not strong enough to support the conclusion that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist conducted a study on the behavior of six individual chameleons.
  The study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  Critics of the study observed that the sample size was very small.
  The study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that the study's results should not be doubted because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This argument is vulnerable to criticism because it does not address the issue of the small sample size.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the issue of the small sample size.
  None of the choices directly address this issue, but A comes closest by suggesting that the argument takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
  This is a related issue because the small sample size of the study means that the results may not be generalizable to all lizards.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is sound, but the answer is not entirely accurate.
  While A is related to the issue of the small sample size, it is not the most accurate answer.
  The argument does not take the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole; it only suggests that the behavior of chameleons may be indicative of the behavior of other lizards.
  The most accurate answer is E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
  The argument suggests that the author's reputation and track record should be enough to support the study's results, while ignoring the valid criticism of the small sample size.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  Critics of the study observed that the sample size was very small.
  The biologist argues that the study's author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that the study's author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years, so the study's results should not be doubted.
  However, the argument does not address the criticism that the sample size was very small, which could affect the generalizability of the study's conclusions.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the issue of sample size.
  The answer is B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
Criticism:
  The argument does not take the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole, so A is not the correct answer.
  The argument does not focus its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself, so C is not the correct answer.
  The argument does not fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise, so D is not the correct answer.
  The argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics, so E is not the correct answer.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals indicates that publishing a scholarly journal is much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  A: Many university libraries charging higher fines for overdue books and periodicals does not directly weaken the argument.
  B: The fact that a university library's acquisition budget represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget is not relevant to the argument.
  C: The argument assumes that publishers of scholarly journals are consistently making a profit.
  D: If subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged, it would weaken the argument that publishing a scholarly journal is much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  E: The frequency of publication of scholarly journals is not relevant to the argument.
Thought:
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals indicates that publishing a scholarly journal is much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  If subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged, it would weaken the argument that publishing a scholarly journal is much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
Criticism:
  Your answer is correct. 
  This fact weakens the argument because if subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged, then the increase in subscription rates for libraries may not be due to publishers making more profit, but rather due to other factors such as changes in the market or changes in the way libraries negotiate subscription rates.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant, but the subscription rates a library pays for such a journal have increased dramatically. 
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that the increase in subscription rates is due to the profitability of publishing a scholarly journal. 
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that provides an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
  A: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument and does not provide an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
  B: This answer choice is also irrelevant to the argument and does not provide an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
  C: This answer choice supports the argument and does not provide an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
  D: This answer choice provides an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates. If most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years, then the increase in subscription rates for libraries cannot be due to the profitability of publishing a scholarly journal. 
  E: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument and does not provide an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
Criticism: 
  Answer choice D does not necessarily weaken the argument, as it is possible that the subscription rates for libraries have increased while the rates for individuals have remained unchanged.

  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals indicates that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  A: Many university libraries charging higher fines for overdue books and periodicals does not directly relate to the argument.
  B: The fact that a university library's acquisition budget represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget does not directly relate to the argument.
  C: The fact that publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise and publishers cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money does not directly relate to the argument.
  D: If subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged for the past several years, it would weaken the argument that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  E: The fact that the majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year does not directly relate to the argument.
Thought: 
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals indicates that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - Several regional hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  - The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
  - The plan made the staff more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
    - This statement is irrelevant to the argument. It does not provide any information that strengthens or weakens the argument.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
    - This statement weakens the argument. If the incidence of patient injuries decreased at a hospital that did not participate in the plan, then the decrease in patient injuries at the hospitals that implemented the plan may not be solely due to the plan.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
    - This statement weakens the argument. If the plan did not record staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not, then the decrease in patient injuries may not be solely due to the plan.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
    - This statement strengthens the argument. It suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff becoming more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties because they were aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
    - This statement is irrelevant to the argument. It does not provide any information that strengthens or weakens the argument.
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to systematically record staff errors reduced patient injuries because the staff became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties. 
  Choice D strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff becoming more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties because they were aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- A plan was implemented to systematically record staff errors in several regional hospitals to reduce patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
- The incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since the implementation of the plan.
- The reason for the decrease in patient injuries is that the knowledge of being monitored made the hospitals' staff more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.

Thought:
- The argument is that the implementation of the plan to systematically record staff errors has led to a decrease in patient injuries.
- To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan.

Evaluation:
- (A) is irrelevant to the argument, as it talks about a policy that was in place before the implementation of the plan.
- (B) weakens the argument, as it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be due to the implementation of the plan.
- (C) weakens the argument, as it suggests that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to capture all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
- (D) strengthens the argument, as it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the staff's awareness of being monitored.
- (E) is irrelevant to the argument, as it talks about the consequences of staff errors rather than the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument is that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the implementation of the plan.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B weakens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries may not be due to the implementation of the plan.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the implementation of the plan.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument is that the knowledge of being monitored made the staff more meticulous, which resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the implementation of the plan.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that there may be errors that were not recorded.
  Choice D strengthens the argument because it shows that the decrease in patient injuries occurred only after the staff became aware of the monitoring.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  Choice D assumes that the staff became more meticulous only after they became aware of the monitoring. It is possible that other factors contributed to the decrease in patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports this claim.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive enough.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
  Option A could be seen as a potential strengthener because it suggests that the hospitals already had a policy of investigating life-threatening staff errors, which could have made the staff more careful even before the implementation of the plan.
  Option D is the most likely strengthener because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries only began after the staff became aware that their errors were being closely monitored. This supports the argument that the knowledge of being monitored made the staff more meticulous in carrying out their duties.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:

- (C) weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to capture all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
- (D) strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries is indeed due to the implementation of the plan.
- (E) is irrelevant to the argument and does not provide any new information that strengthens the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument is that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports this claim.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
  Option A could weaken the argument if the hospitals already had a policy of investigating life-threatening errors before the implementation of the plan.
  Option D supports the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff becoming more careful after they became aware that their errors were being monitored.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Several regional hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors to reduce patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
  - The incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since the plan was implemented.
  - The reason for the decrease in patient injuries is that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
    - This statement is irrelevant to the argument that the plan to systematically record staff errors reduced patient injuries.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
    - This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be solely due to the plan implemented at the hospitals.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
    - This statement is irrelevant to the argument that the plan to systematically record staff errors reduced patient injuries.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
    - This statement strengthens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff's increased awareness of the monitoring of their errors.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
    - This statement is irrelevant to the argument that the plan to systematically record staff errors reduced patient injuries.
Thought:
  The argument is that the systematic recording of staff errors reduced patient injuries because the staff became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties. 
  Choice D strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff's increased awareness of the monitoring of their errors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument is that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports this claim.
  A: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about the plan to record staff errors.
  B: This answer choice weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be solely due to the implementation of the plan.
  C: This answer choice weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to capture all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  D: This answer choice strengthens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff becoming more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties after they became aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
  E: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about the plan to record staff errors.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
- The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
- The argument is that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
- To strengthen the argument, we need to find a statement that supports the idea that the plan caused the decrease in patient injuries.
- Choice B is irrelevant because it refers to a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
- Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan did not record all errors that could have caused patient injuries.
- Choice E is also irrelevant because it only talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.
- Choice A could be seen as weakening the argument because it suggests that the hospitals already had a policy to investigate life-threatening staff errors before the plan was implemented.
- Choice D is the best answer because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries only occurred after the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, which supports the idea that the plan caused the decrease in patient injuries.
Criticism:
- Choice A could also be seen as strengthening the argument because it suggests that the hospitals were already taking steps to investigate staff errors before the plan was implemented, which could have made the staff more careful.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded
  E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did.
  The CEO also argues that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Choices:
  A: The CEO does take for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. This is evident in the statement "there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution."
  B: The CEO's argument does not relate to the possibility that different causes can have similar effects.
  C: The CEO's argument does generalize too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. The CEO is responding to the criticism that the corporation is not environmentally responsible, but is generalizing to the class of criticisms that the corporation is not doing all they can to pollute less.
  D: The CEO's argument does not take for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded.
  E: The CEO's argument does not address the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now.
Thought: 
  The CEO's argument is flawed because they take for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed.
  Therefore, the answer is A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the CEO's argument is flawed because they take for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed.
  However, the CEO's argument also generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms.
  Therefore, the correct answer could also be C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The CEO is defending the corporation against criticism of not being environmentally responsible.
  The CEO argues that the corporation's current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods.
  The CEO argues that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Thought:
  The CEO's argument is flawed because he assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
  This is a hasty generalization because it assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution without providing evidence to support this claim.
  The CEO's argument also fails to address the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now.
  Therefore, the answer is E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct. The CEO's argument is flawed because it assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution without providing evidence to support this claim. 
  Additionally, the CEO's argument does not address the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The CEO is arguing that the company is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods.
  The CEO states that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Choices:
  A: The CEO does take for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed. This is evident in the statement that "there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution."
  B: The CEO's argument does not involve different causes having similar effects, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
  C: The CEO does generalize too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. The CEO is responding to the criticism that the company is not environmentally responsible, but then claims that environmentally responsible corporations are those that do all they can to pollute less. This is a hasty generalization because it assumes that all criticisms of the company's environmental responsibility fall under the same class.
  D: The CEO's argument does not take for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded. The CEO is arguing that the company is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods.
  E: The CEO's argument does not ignore the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now. The CEO acknowledges that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, but does not claim that the company is using the best available methods.
Thought: 
  The CEO's argument is flawed because it takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed and generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms.

  D: The CEO does take for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded. This is evident in the statement "Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did."
  E: The CEO's argument does not address the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now, so this choice is not relevant to the argument.
Thought: 
  The CEO's argument takes for granted that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, and that the corporation is environmentally responsible because they have reduced pollution.

Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct. The CEO's argument is flawed because it assumes that there are no production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now. However, this may not be true, and the CEO's argument does not consider this possibility.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The CEO is defending the corporation against accusations of not being environmentally responsible.
  The CEO argues that the corporation's current production methods pollute significantly less than its old methods.
  The CEO argues that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Thought:
  The CEO's argument is flawed because they are arguing against a strawman.
  The CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because it pollutes less than it used to.
  However, being environmentally responsible means doing all that can be done to pollute less, not just polluting less than before.
  The CEO's argument does not address whether the corporation is doing all that it can to pollute less.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms.
  The answer is C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms.

  The CEO is defending against the criticism of not being environmentally responsible by arguing that they are doing all they can to pollute less.
  However, the CEO's argument does not address the possibility that there are other ways to be environmentally responsible besides polluting less.
  Therefore, the CEO's argument is flawed because it assumes that polluting less is the only way to be environmentally responsible.
  The answer is C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  The CEO's argument is flawed because they are assuming that polluting less is the only way to be environmentally responsible.
  However, there are other ways to be environmentally responsible, such as using renewable energy sources or implementing recycling programs.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether
Choices:
  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile
  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile
  D: there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered
  E: the average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile

  Larew and Mendota are discussing the change in income of the lowest and highest income quintiles over the last ten years.
  Larew argues that the percentage increase in average income for the lowest quintile was higher than that of the highest quintile, indicating a relative increase in economic prosperity for the lowest quintile.
  Mendota disagrees, arguing that the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Thought: 
  Larew and Mendota disagree about whether the change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income or by comparing the absolute amount of the increase in average income.
  Therefore, the answer is A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Larew argues that the lowest income quintile had a higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than the highest quintile, so their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's.
  Mendota disagrees with Larew's argument.
Thought: 
  Larew and Mendota disagree about whether the change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income or not.
  Therefore, the answer is A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
Thought: 
  The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will not survive if wetlands are developed without replacement wetland habitats.
  If the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in developed wetlands without replacement wetland habitats, then the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission would not be valid.
  Therefore, the assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends is B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
Criticism: 
  The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission is based on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will not survive if wetlands are developed without replacement wetland habitats.
  However, the argument advanced by the Figorian Development Commission is also based on assumptions that may or may not be valid.
  For example, the Figorian Development Commission assumes that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
Thought: 
  The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands. If this assumption is not true, then the construction of replacement wetland habitats will not protect wildlife and the argument falls apart.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
- The Figorian Development Commission argues that wetland development is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
Thought:
- The Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument depends on the assumption that the replacement wetland habitats will be effective in protecting the wildlife that inhabits the original wetlands.
- Choice A is irrelevant to the argument and is not an assumption on which the argument depends.
- Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument and is not an assumption on which the argument depends.
- Choice D is not necessarily an assumption on which the argument depends, as the argument is about future wetland development and not past development.
- Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument and is not an assumption on which the argument depends.
- Therefore, the assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends is that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
- This assumption is necessary for the argument because if the replacement wetland habitats are not effective in protecting the wildlife, then the development of wetlands would still pose a threat to the species that inhabit them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
- The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria should allow wetland development because it is necessary for growth and they have the right to govern their own resources.
Thought:
- The Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument depends on an assumption that supports the idea that offsetting wetland development with the construction of replacement wetland habitats will actually protect wildlife.
- Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
- Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
- Choice D is not relevant to the argument.
- Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
- The only choice that is relevant to the argument is B, which assumes that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
- If this assumption is not true, then the Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument falls apart because the replacement wetlands would not actually protect the wildlife.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development in Figoria must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
Thought: 
  The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands. If this assumption is false, then the construction of replacement wetland habitats will not protect wildlife and the argument will fail.
  A, C, D, and E are not relevant to the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
Criticism: 
  The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission assumes that the construction of replacement wetland habitats will be successful in protecting wildlife. However, this assumption may not be true in all cases. Some species may not be able to survive in replacement wetlands, or the replacement wetlands may not be able to support the same level of biodiversity as the natural wetlands. Additionally, the argument does not address the potential impact of other types of development on wildlife, so it is unclear whether wetland development is the most significant threat to wildlife.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development in Figoria should be regulated and offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that wetland development is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
Thought: 
  The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands. If this assumption is false, then the offsetting of wetland development with the construction of replacement wetland habitats would not protect wildlife as intended.
  A: The argument does not depend on this assumption.
  B: This assumption is necessary for the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
  C: The argument does not address wetland development in nations that are primarily agricultural, so this assumption is not necessary.
  D: This assumption is not necessary for the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
  E: The argument does not depend on this assumption.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of identifying the polluter responsible for a river pollution incident.
  The penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument suggests that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the idea that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe, and therefore, the identity of the polluter must be certain before imposing the penalty.
  Principle A supports this reasoning by stating that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty.
  Principles B, C, D, and E are not directly related to the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river.

  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Criticism: 
  The argument does not explicitly state that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe, but it does suggest that it is severe.
  The argument does not explicitly state that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty, but it does suggest that this is the case.
  The principle in choice A is the most relevant to the argument, but it is not explicitly stated in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence of guilt.
  A: This principle suggests that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing the penalty.
  B: This principle discusses the appropriate level of severity for penalties, but it does not directly address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  C: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused, but it does not directly address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  D: This principle suggests that severe penalties may discourage someone from admitting responsibility, but it does not directly address the issue of certainty of guilt.
  E: This principle directly addresses the issue of certainty of guilt and suggests that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it is impossible to be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment.
Thought:
  The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty without sufficient evidence of guilt.

  The argument does not discuss the principle of deterrence or the proportionality of penalties to harm caused.
  The argument does not discuss the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for an offense.
  The argument does not suggest that the severity of the penalty is so great that guilt can never be sufficiently certain to justify punishment.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a polluter due to lack of certainty of their identity.
  A: This principle states that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: This principle states that penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: This principle states that the severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: This principle states that the more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam.
  A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.
Thought:
  The columnist has judged the legislator's proposal as unacceptable.
  We need to find a principle that justifies the columnist's judgment.
  Option A is not relevant to the situation.
  Option B is relevant, but it does not justify the columnist's judgment.
  Option C is relevant because the proposal is to use the additional charge on water bills to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  Option D is not relevant to the situation.
  Option E is relevant, but it does not justify the columnist's judgment.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
Criticism:
  The principle in option C is relevant to the situation, but it is not the only principle that could justify the columnist's judgment.
  Option B could also be a valid principle to justify the judgment.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam.
  A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.
Thought: 
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The legislator wants to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist believes that the extra money from water bills should be used to build a dam.
  The principle that would most help to justify the columnist's judgment is that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  The reason is that building a dam would benefit the entire community by providing a reliable source of water, while building new roads would only benefit some members of the community.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
Criticism: 
  The principle that customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used could also be used to justify the columnist's judgment.
  However, it is not as directly related to the situation as the principle in choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:

  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The legislator's proposal is to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building the dam.
  The columnist believes that the extra money from water bills should be used to build the dam.
  Therefore, the columnist believes that the money designated for the dam should not be used for other projects.
  Choice B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community, supports the columnist's judgment.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")

  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The legislator's proposal is to spend the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist believes that the extra money from water bills should be used to build a dam.
  The columnist's judgment is based on the principle that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
Criticism: 
  The principle that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community is a valid principle.
  However, it is not the most helpful principle in justifying the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The most helpful principle would be that the money collected from an additional charge on water bills should be used for water-related expenditures.
  Therefore, the answer should be E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:

  The legislator's proposal is to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist believes that the money collected from the additional charge on water bills should be used to build the dam.
  To justify the columnist's judgment, we need to find a principle that supports the idea that the money collected from the additional charge on water bills should be used to build the dam, not for other purposes.
  Choice B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community, is not relevant to the situation.
  Choice C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of, is not relevant to the situation.

  The government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills to build a dam.
  A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.
Thought:
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  We need to find a principle that justifies the columnist's judgment.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  The money collected from the additional charge on water bills is designated for building a dam, which will benefit the entire community by providing water supply.
  The legislator's proposal to use the money to build new roads will benefit only some members of the community.

  A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.
  The columnist has judged that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The principle that most helps to justify the columnist's judgment is B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  The money collected from the additional charge on water bills is designated for building a dam, which will benefit the entire community by providing a new source of water.
  The legislator's proposal to use the money for building new roads will only benefit some members of the community and not the entire community.
  Therefore, the legislator's proposal violates the principle that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  Hence, the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable is justified by principle B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:

  Therefore, none of the options justify the columnist's judgment.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Criticism:
  Your analysis is correct. None of the options justify the columnist's judgment.
  However, the question asks for the principle that most helps to justify the columnist's judgment.
  Even though none of the options perfectly justifies the columnist's judgment, we need to select the option that comes closest to justifying the judgment.
  Option C comes closest to justifying the judgment because it suggests that the additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  Therefore, the answer is C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
Action: Answer("C")

  - The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  - The question asks which principle, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment.
  - The legislator's proposal is to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  - The additional charge on water bills was approved to build a dam, not for building new roads.
  - Therefore, the principle that most helps to justify the columnist's judgment is that "Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community."
  - The legislator's proposal to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads benefits only some members of the community, whereas the dam benefits the entire community.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The Florida panther population has increased from the 1970s but is still not self-sustaining.
- The current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers.
Choices:
A: The statement that the panthers' current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals implies that some part of the habitat may be of marginal quality, but this is not a necessary conclusion.
B: The passage does not provide enough information to support this statement.
C: This statement is supported by the information in the passage.
D: The passage does not provide enough information to support this statement.
E: The passage does not provide enough information to support this statement.
Thought:
The passage states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers, and the population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining. Therefore, unless the panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining. 
Therefore, the correct answer is C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
Criticism:
There is no flaw in the logic used to arrive at the answer C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Florida panthers are an endangered species.
  There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today.
  Their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
Thought:
  The current habitat of Florida panthers is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  Therefore, unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.

Thought: 
  The passage states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  Therefore, unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  The answer is C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality, so A is not necessarily true.
  The passage states that their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining, but it does not say that exceeding 250 will guarantee self-sustainability, so B is not necessarily true.
  The passage does not suggest that the population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level, so D is not necessarily true.
  The passage does not provide any information about the size of the panthers' habitat in the 1970s, so E is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The Florida panther population has increased from the 1970s but is still below the self-sustaining level of 250.
- The current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers.
Choices:
A: The statement that the panthers' current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals suggests that the quality of the habitat is not the issue, but rather the quantity. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.
B: The passage states that the panther population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining, but it does not state that exceeding that number will guarantee self-sustainability. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.
C: The passage states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more panthers, and that the population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining. Therefore, it can be concluded that unless the panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining. This is the correct answer.
D: The passage does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the panther population will never increase much beyond its current level. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.
E: The passage does not provide any information about the size of the panthers' habitat in the 1970s compared to today. Therefore, this statement cannot be concluded from the given information.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

  The advertisement concludes that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Thought:
  A: If at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened. However, the advertisement claims that the sample is representative of all new policyholders, so it is unlikely that all of them saved little or no money.
  B: The advertisement does not make any assumptions about the premiums paid by new policyholders compared to those who have held policies for a longer period of time. Therefore, this choice is not a valid criticism.
  C: The advertisement does not address the possibility that switching to another insurance company could enable policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. Therefore, this choice is a valid criticism.
  D: The advertisement does not make any assumptions about whether policyholders underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Therefore, this choice is not a valid criticism.
  E: The advertisement does not address the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders. Therefore, this choice is not a valid criticism.
  The best criticism is C, as it points out that the advertisement fails to address the possibility that switching to another insurance company could enable policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

Knowledge: 
  The study compared two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students).
  Each member of the two groups was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time.
  Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
  There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The study shows that Group A performed better than Group B in making a telephone call at a specified time.
  The conclusion is properly drawn because the study compared two groups of people, one group of older people and one group of college students, and found that the older group performed better.
  Option A is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that the groups are of equal size and therefore comparable.
  Option B is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which eliminates any potential bias.
  Option C is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it eliminates the possibility that the college students included older individuals who may have performed better.
  Option D is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that both groups had the same resources available to them.
  Option E is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that both groups had the same amount of time to prepare for the task.
  Therefore, none of the options are least helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:

  The study compared two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students).
  Each member of the two groups was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time.
  Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
  There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence is that Group A performed better than Group B in making a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  A: The number of people in each group is not relevant to the conclusion.
  B: The same group of researchers answering the calls made by the callers in both study groups is relevant to the conclusion.
  C: The age of the college students is not relevant to the conclusion.
  D: Both groups having unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls is not relevant to the conclusion.
  E: The members of the two groups receiving their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls is relevant to the conclusion.
  Therefore, the least helpful option is A: There was the same number of people in each group.
Criticism: 
  The number of people in each group could be relevant if there was a significant difference in the number of people in each group.
  However, the difference in the number of people in each group is not significant in this study.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared Group A (persons aged 65-75) and Group B (college students) in their ability to remember to make a telephone call at a specified time.
  Group A had only one lapse, while Group B had fourteen lapses.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence is that Group A (older people) performed better than Group B (college students) in remembering to make a telephone call at a specified time.
  Therefore, the conclusion is properly drawn.
  To evaluate the answer choices, we need to look for the option that is least helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  A: This is helpful because it ensures that the groups are comparable in size.
  B: This is helpful because it ensures that the same researchers were involved in both groups, reducing the possibility of bias.
  C: This is helpful because it ensures that there were no confounding factors related to age in the college student group.
  D: This is helpful because it ensures that both groups had the same resources available to them.
  E: This is helpful because it ensures that both groups had the same amount of time to prepare for the task.
  None of the options seem particularly unhelpful, but if we had to choose, we could say that option B is the least helpful because it is not directly related to memory performance.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared the ability of two groups, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), to make a telephone call at a specified time.
  Group A had only one lapse, while Group B had fourteen lapses.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the fact that Group A performed better than Group B in remembering to make the telephone call at a specified time.
  To establish that the conclusion is properly drawn, we need to identify the option that is least helpful in supporting the conclusion.
  A: This option is helpful in establishing that the study was conducted fairly, but it does not directly relate to the conclusion.
  B: This option is helpful in establishing that the study was conducted fairly, but it does not directly relate to the conclusion.
  C: This option is helpful in establishing that the college students were not older than forty years old, but it does not directly relate to the conclusion.
  D: This option is helpful in establishing that both groups had the same resources, but it does not directly relate to the conclusion.
  E: This option is helpful in establishing that both groups had the same amount of time to prepare, but it does not directly relate to the conclusion.
  Therefore, the least helpful option is difficult to determine, as all options are not directly related to the conclusion.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared two groups of people: Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students).
  Each member of the two groups was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time, and the time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically.
  Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence is that Group A performed better than Group B in making a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  A: This statement is helpful because it establishes that the two groups were of equal size, which is important for ensuring that the results are not skewed by differences in sample size. Therefore, this statement is not the least helpful.
  B: This statement is helpful because it establishes that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which is important for ensuring that the results are not skewed by differences in the way the calls were answered. Therefore, this statement is not the least helpful.
  C: This statement is not helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn because it does not provide any information about memory or the ability to make a telephone call at a specified time. Therefore, this statement is the least helpful.
  D: This statement is helpful because it establishes that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which is important for ensuring that the results are not skewed by differences in access to telephones. Therefore, this statement is not the least helpful.
  E: This statement is helpful because it establishes that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which is important for ensuring that the results are not skewed by differences in the amount of time available to prepare for the calls. Therefore, this statement is not the least helpful.

  Group A had only one lapse, while Group B had fourteen lapses.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, as Group A (older people) performed better than Group B (college students) in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  To establish that the conclusion is properly drawn, we need to eliminate any answer choice that weakens the conclusion.
  Answer choice A is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn, as it ensures that the two groups are comparable in size.
  Answer choice B is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn, as it ensures that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, eliminating any potential bias.
  Answer choice C weakens the conclusion, as it introduces a confounding variable (age) that may have affected the results.
  Answer choice D is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn, as it ensures that both groups had the same access to the means of making the required calls.
  Answer choice E is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn, as it ensures that both groups had the same amount of time to prepare for the task.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.
Question: The reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: widespread cynicism is beneficial to the wellbeing of society
  B: cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the am01mt of information one has about them
  C: the work of contemporary journalists reflects a cynicism that is not really genuine
  D: any accurate description of human bebavior portrays it as selfish
  E: cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Resident: Data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in our town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe. Hence, at least 60 percent of our town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Question: The reasoning in the resident's argument is flawed in that the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the town has a relatively small number of houses
  B: inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe
  C: structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage
  D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe
  E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The resident's argument is that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The data indicates that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  A: The size of the town is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The argument acknowledges that inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe.
  C: The argument does not compare the difficulty of fixing inadequate site drainage versus structural defects.
  D: This is a possibility that the argument overlooks.
  E: This is a possibility that the argument does not address.
Thought:
  The argument states that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The argument is based on the data that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  If many houses do not have these problems, then the argument's conclusion that at least 60% of the houses have problems that threaten their integrity may not be valid.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Criticism:
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The resident's argument states that 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Thought:
  The resident's argument assumes that the two problems (inadequate site drainage and structural defects) are mutually exclusive.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that some houses may have both problems.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct.
  There is no flaw in the argument that the town has a relatively small number of houses, or that inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe, or that structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage.
  Therefore, A, B, and C are not correct.
  Also, the argument does not assume that all houses have problems, so D is not correct.
Action: Answer("E")

Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The resident's argument states that 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Thought:
  The resident's argument assumes that the two problems are mutually exclusive, meaning that a house can only have one problem or the other.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that some houses may have both problems, which would mean that the total percentage of houses with problems could be less than 60%.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct.
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  The resident claims that 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Thought: 
  The resident's argument assumes that the two problems (inadequate site drainage and structural defects) are mutually exclusive, but they could overlap.
  For example, a house could have both inadequate site drainage and a structural defect that makes it unsafe.
  Therefore, the argument overlooks the possibility that some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
  The answer is E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  There is no flaw in the resident's argument that the town has a relatively small number of houses, that inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe, or that structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage.
  Therefore, A, B, and C are not correct.
  The argument also does not overlook the possibility that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe, so D is not correct.

  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Thought:
  The resident's argument assumes that the two problems are mutually exclusive.
  The argument assumes that the 30% of houses with inadequate site drainage are not part of the 30% of houses with structural defects.
  The argument also assumes that there is no overlap between the two groups.
  Therefore, the argument overlooks the possibility that some houses have both inadequate site drainage and structural defects.
  The answer is E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.

  The resident's argument is that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The data indicates that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  A: The size of the town is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The argument acknowledges that inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe.
  C: The argument does not compare the ease of fixing structural defects versus inadequate site drainage.
  D: This choice presents an alternative possibility that the argument overlooks.
  E: This choice presents an alternative possibility that some houses may have both problems.
Thought:
  The argument states that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The data indicates that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that some houses may have neither problem.
  If some houses have neither problem, then the percentage of houses with problems would be less than 60%.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.

  Choice A suggests that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control, but this does not directly support the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice B suggests that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, which contradicts the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice C supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed, but it does not directly support the idea that we can only do so if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available, which supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Tolstoy claimed that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought: 
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that Tolstoy's claim is false.
  To properly draw this conclusion, we need to assume that people can be subject to praise or blame for actions that were freely performed.
  Choice A suggests that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B suggests that the responsibility for an act is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, which is also not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C suggests that we can only be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed, which is consistent with the argument but does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise varies with the amount of information available. This assumption enables the conclusion to be properly drawn because it allows for the possibility that we can praise or blame a person for an action even if we do not know everything about the events that led to that action.
  Choice E suggests that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed, which is not relevant to the argument.
Criticism: 
  Choice C is consistent with the argument, but it does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn because it does not address the possibility that we can praise or blame a person for an action even if we do not regard that action as freely performed.
  Choice D is the best answer because it enables the conclusion to be properly drawn by allowing for the possibility that we can praise or blame a person for an action even if we do not know everything about the events that led to that action.
Action: Answer("D")

  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Tolstoy claimed that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought:
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that Tolstoy's claim is rash.
  To properly draw this conclusion, we need an assumption that supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C is restating the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E contradicts the argument.
  Therefore, none of the choices enable the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought: 
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim.
  The assumption that would enable the conclusion to be properly drawn is one that supports the idea that we can still praise or blame a person for an action even if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice A suggests that people should not be praised or blamed for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, which is also not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed, which is not the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise varies with the amount of information available, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E suggests that if we do not know much about the events leading up to an action, we will regard that action as freely performed, which supports the idea that we can still praise or blame a person for an action even if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Therefore, the assumption that enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:

  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought: 
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim.
  To properly draw this conclusion, we need to assume that Tolstoy's claim is false.
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Therefore, if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would still regard that action as freely performed.
  This assumption is best captured by choice B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Tolstoy claimed that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought: 
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that Tolstoy's claim is rash.
  In order for this conclusion to be properly drawn, we need to assume that the ethicist's premise is true.
  The premise is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Therefore, the assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn is that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  The answer is B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is incorrect.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn is not that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  Rather, the assumption is that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:

Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The pharmacist claims that a study showed that melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81.
  The pharmacist claims that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct.
Thought:
  The pharmacist's argument seems to be that the study supports the manufacturers' claims that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  However, the study does not directly support this claim.
  The study only shows that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81.
  The study does not show that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  Therefore, the pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Criticism:
  Your analysis is correct.
  The pharmacist's argument is flawed because it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.

Thought:
  The pharmacist's argument is that the study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81, and that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages. Therefore, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  The argument seems to be based on a correlation between the alleviation of insomnia symptoms and the production of melatonin by the pineal gland.
  However, the argument does not establish a causal relationship between the two.
  It is possible that the alleviation of insomnia symptoms is due to factors other than the production of melatonin by the pineal gland.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Criticism:
  The criticism is correct. The pharmacist's argument is based on a correlation between the alleviation of insomnia symptoms and the production of melatonin by the pineal gland, but it does not establish a causal relationship between the two.

  D: Confusing an effect of a phenomenon with its cause is a type of causal fallacy.
  E: The argument does not rely on an unrepresentative sample.
Thought: 
  The pharmacist argues that a study shows that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in older people.
  The pharmacist concludes that the claims made by melatonin supplement manufacturers are correct.
  The study may not have been conducted on the same type of melatonin supplement that the manufacturers are selling.
  The study may not have been conducted on a large enough sample size to be representative.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it relies on the assumption that the study is applicable to all melatonin supplements and populations.
  The argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The argument is flawed in that it relies on a causal fallacy.
  The answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.

  The pharmacist's argument seems to be that the study shows that melatonin is effective in alleviating insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81, and that this supports the manufacturers' claims that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages. 
  However, the study does not necessarily support the manufacturers' claims, as the study did not investigate the relationship between age and melatonin production. 
  Therefore, the pharmacist's argument is flawed.
  The pharmacist's argument does not infer from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect (A), rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased (B), depend on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion (C), confuse an effect of a phenomenon with its cause (D), or rely on a sample that is unrepresentative (E).
  The best answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Criticism:
  The pharmacist's argument does not seem to confuse an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.

  However, the pharmacist's argument does not take into account other factors that may contribute to insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81, such as changes in sleep patterns, health conditions, or medications.
  Additionally, the pharmacist's argument assumes that the study is reliable and that the manufacturers' claims are based on scientific evidence.
  Therefore, the pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The correct answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Criticism:
  Your answer is correct. The pharmacist's argument assumes that the effect of ingesting melatonin is the cause of insomnia symptoms, when in fact there may be other causes that contribute to insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81.

Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.

Knowledge: 
  The physician conducted an experiment with 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  One group received small magnets applied to their backs, while the other group received no treatment.
  Most patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the second group did.
Thought:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to find an option that weakens the physician's conclusion.
  A: This option suggests that the improvement in the first group may be due to a placebo effect, rather than the magnets themselves. However, this does not necessarily mean that the magnets are not effective.
  B: This option is irrelevant to the argument being made about magnetic fields, and does not provide a counter to the physician's argument.
  C: This option is also irrelevant to the argument being made about magnetic fields, and does not provide a counter to the physician's argument.
  D: This option suggests that the experiment may have been biased, but it does not necessarily mean that the magnets are not effective.
  E: This option weakens the physician's argument by suggesting that the variation in causes of the chronic back pain may have affected the results of the experiment.
  Therefore, the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.

  Choice A suggests that the improvement in the first group could be due to a placebo effect.
  If the improvement in the first group was due to a placebo effect, then the magnetic fields may not actually be effective at relieving back pain.
  Therefore, choice A is the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The physician conducted an experiment on 50 patients with chronic back pain.
- One group received small magnets applied to their backs, while the other group received no treatment.
- Most patients in the magnet group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the no-treatment group did.
Thought:
- The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
- To counter this argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the physician's conclusion.
- Option A suggests that the improvement in pain reported by the magnet group could be due to a placebo effect rather than the magnets themselves.
- Option B is irrelevant to the argument about magnetic fields.
- Option C is also irrelevant to the argument about magnetic fields.
- Option D suggests that the experiment may have been biased by the scientists' preconceptions, but this does not necessarily mean that the magnets were not effective.
- Option E suggests that the variation in causes of the back pain could have affected the results, making it difficult to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of magnets.
- Option E is the strongest counter to the physician's argument because it suggests that the variation in causes of the back pain could have affected the results, making it difficult to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of magnets.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The physician conducted an experiment on 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  The patients were divided into two groups, one group received small magnets on their backs and the other group received no treatment.
  Most of the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the second group reported any reduction in pain.
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the group that received magnets reported a significant reduction in pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to find an option that weakens the physician's argument.
  Option A suggests that the patients in the first group may have reported a reduction in pain simply because they knew they were receiving treatment, not because the magnets were actually effective.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about medication, not magnets.
  Option C is also irrelevant because it talks about other areas of pain, not back pain.
  Option D suggests that the scientists who designed the experiment may have had a bias towards magnets, but this does not necessarily mean that the magnets were not effective.
  Option E suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain may have affected the results of the experiment.
  Option A weakens the physician's argument the most because it suggests that the reduction in pain reported by the patients in the first group may not have been due to the magnets, but rather due to the patients' belief that they were receiving treatment.
Criticism: 
  Option E could also be a strong counter to the physician's argument because the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain may have affected the results of the experiment.
  However, option A is still a stronger counter because it directly challenges the validity of the results of the experiment.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:

  The physician conducted an experiment on 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  The patients were divided into two groups: one group received small magnets applied to their backs, while the other group received no treatment.
  Most of the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the second group did.
Thought:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the results of the experiment.
  To counter this argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the conclusion that magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the first group may be due to a placebo effect rather than the magnets themselves. However, it does not directly address the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  C: This statement suggests that the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving pain may be limited to the back. However, it does not directly address the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  D: This statement suggests that the scientists who designed the experiment may have had a bias towards magnetic fields. However, it does not directly address the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  E: This statement suggests that the variation in the causes of chronic back pain may have affected the results of the experiment. This weakens the conclusion that magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain, as the effectiveness of magnetic fields may vary depending on the cause of the pain.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Criticism: N/A

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them

  The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
Thought:
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  However, the argument assumes that the decline in market share is the only factor affecting the company's net income.
  The argument does not consider other factors that could have affected the company's net income, such as changes in the cost of production or changes in the retail price of the hair dryer.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the argument is flawed.

  The average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is the only reason for the decline in net income from sales of the product.
  The argument does not provide any evidence that the total sales of hair dryers have declined.
  The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold is the same for all companies.
  The argument assumes that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has remained constant over the past 5 years.
  The argument assumes that the hair dryer is one of Wilson Appliance's most profitable products.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the argument is flawed because it overlooks several other factors that could have contributed to the decline in net income.
  Choice A correctly identifies the flaw in the argument.
Criticism: 
  The argument does not provide any evidence that the total sales of hair dryers have declined.
  The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold is the same for all companies.
  The argument assumes that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has remained constant over the past 5 years.
  The argument assumes that the hair dryer is one of Wilson Appliance's most profitable products.
  However, choice A correctly identifies the flaw in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% of all hair dryer sales nationwide over the past 5 years.
  The argument also states that the average net income per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
Thought:
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  However, the argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the past 5 years, which may not be true.
  The argument also assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold is the same for all companies that produce hair dryers, which may not be true.
  The argument does not provide any information about the sales figures for Wilson Appliance's other products, which may have increased or decreased over the past 5 years.
  The argument does not consider the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years, which would affect the net income per hair dryer sold.
  The argument does not provide any independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.
Criticism:
  The argument mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product.
  The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold is the same for all companies that produce hair dryers, which may not be true.
  The argument does not provide any information about the sales figures for Wilson Appliance's other products, which may have increased or decreased over the past 5 years.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years.
  The argument provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  A: Some animal species on the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Thought:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an option that contradicts the argument.
  A: This option does not weaken the argument because the argument does not claim that all animal species on the islands are found in the Americas.
  B: This option does not weaken the argument because the argument does not claim that the iguana species on the islands are identical to those found in the Americas.
  C: This option does not weaken the argument because the argument does not claim that iguanas frequently raft long distances between land masses.
  D: This option weakens the argument because it suggests that the iguana species on the islands may have originated in Australia, not the Americas.
  E: This option does not weaken the argument because the argument does not claim that all plant and animal species found in Australia or South America date back to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Criticism:
  There is no criticism to this answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  A: The presence of other animal species on the islands that are not found in the Americas does not necessarily weaken the argument about the iguanas.
  B: Genetic differences between the iguanas on the islands and those in the Americas do not necessarily weaken the argument that the iguanas rafted across the Pacific.
  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting does not necessarily weaken the argument that the iguanas rafted across the Pacific.
  D: The presence of fossils of iguana species closely related to those on the islands in Australia does not necessarily weaken the argument that the iguanas rafted across the Pacific.
  E: The fact that numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana suggests that the iguanas may have existed in Australia or South America before the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Thought: 
  The argument is that the iguanas on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  If it can be shown that the iguanas could have existed in Australia or South America before the fragmentation of Gondwana, then the argument that they rafted across the Pacific from the Americas would be weakened.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  A: Some animal species on the islands are not found in the Americas, but this does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about the iguanas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, but this does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how they got to the islands.
  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
  D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, this would weaken the scientist's argument that the iguanas must have rafted across the Pacific from the Americas.
  E: The fact that numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguanas on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, this would suggest that the iguanas may have come from Australia, rather than the Americas.
  Therefore, D weakens the scientist's argument the most.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  A: Some animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  If there are other animal species on the islands that are not found in the Americas, it is possible that the iguanas also came from somewhere else.
  If genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, it is possible that they evolved separately on the islands.
  If documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon, it is less likely that the iguanas rafted from the Americas to the islands near Australia.
  If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, it is possible that the iguanas originated in Australia and then rafted to the islands.
  If the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, it is possible that the iguanas were already present on the islands before they fragmented from Gondwana.
  Therefore, the answer is either A, B, C, D, or E.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on a small group of islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  A: The presence of other animal species on the islands that are not found in the Americas does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about the iguana species.
  B: Genetic differences between the iguana species on the islands and those found in the Americas do not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  D: The presence of fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands in Australia does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.

Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on a small group of islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an option that suggests an alternative explanation for how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  A: The presence of other animal species on the islands that are not found in the Americas does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about the iguana species.
  B: Genetic differences between the iguana species on the islands and those found in the Americas do not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  D: The presence of fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands in Australia does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  E: If numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, it is possible that the iguana species on the islands also existed in the region prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana and were able to survive on the islands as they formed. This suggests an alternative explanation for how the iguana species arrived on the islands.
  Therefore, E weakens the scientist's argument the most.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  A: Some animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  If there are other ways for the iguanas to get to the islands, then the scientist's argument is weakened.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
  B: If the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, then it is possible that they did not come from the Americas.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
  D: If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, then it is possible that the iguanas on the islands did not come from the Americas.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or D.
Criticism: 
  The argument is based on the fact that the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, so it is unlikely that the iguanas could have come from anywhere else.
  However, the genetic analysis and fossils suggest that the iguanas on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, which weakens the argument that they must have come from the Americas.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:

  E: The fact that numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana does not provide an alternative explanation for how the iguanas could have arrived on the islands.
  None of the options provide an alternative explanation for how the iguanas could have arrived on the islands.
  Therefore, none of the options weaken the scientist's argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

  The argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an alternative explanation for how the iguanas could have arrived on the islands.
  Choice A does not provide an alternative explanation for how the iguanas could have arrived on the islands.
  Choice B does not provide an alternative explanation for how the iguanas could have arrived on the islands.
  Choice C does not provide an alternative explanation for how the iguanas could have arrived on the islands.
  Choice D does not provide an alternative explanation for how the iguanas could have arrived on the islands.
  Choice E suggests that the iguanas could have been present on the islands prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, which weakens the argument that they must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  However, it is important to note that the argument is not that the iguanas could not have been present on the islands prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, but rather that they must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  Therefore, choice E does not necessarily provide an alternative explanation for how the iguanas could have arrived on the islands.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

  The argument claims that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports this claim by citing statistics that reveal more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  However, the argument fails to consider the possibility that the presence of designated bicycle lanes may actually increase the number of bicyclists on the road, which could lead to more collisions.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: While it is true that bees' vision is well suited to the task of identifying flowers by their colors, it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the statement above?
Choices:
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Response 0:

  To support this claim, we need to find an option that shows that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  None of the options seem to support the claim.
  Therefore, none of the options is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This statement does not support the given statement.

  Your reasoning is correct that none of the options provide evidence that supports the idea that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  However, the question asks for the option that most strongly supports the statement above, not for the option that supports the statement above.
  Therefore, you should select the option that is most closely related to the statement above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This may suggest that bees' vision is not the only factor that influenced the development of flowers.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This may suggest that bees' vision is not the only factor that influenced the development of flowers.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This fact does not provide any evidence to support the statement.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This fact does not provide any evidence to support the statement.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This fact does not provide any evidence to support the statement.
Thought:

  If many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If the number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If many nonflowering plants rely on bees, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Criticism:
  The answer is a weak support for the statement. It only suggests that bees rely on flowers for their food, but it does not directly support the claim that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:

  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This does not support the statement.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This does not support the statement.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This supports the statement because it suggests that bees and flowers have a co-evolutionary relationship.
Thought: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, then it is likely that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  Therefore, E most strongly supports the statement.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:

  To support this statement, we need to find an option that suggests that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  Option A, B, C, D, and E do not support the statement.
  Therefore, none of the options strongly supports the statement.
  However, option A weakly supports the statement by suggesting that not all insects with similar vision to bees depend on perceiving an object's color.
Criticism:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  Option A, B, C, D, and E do not support the statement.
  However, option A does not relate to the development of flowers in response to bees' vision.

  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Thought: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  If the number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  If many nonflowering plants rely on bees, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
Criticism: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  While the number of different species of flowers being greater than the number of different species of bees may support the idea that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision, it is not a strong enough argument to "most strongly support" the statement.
  A stronger argument would be evidence that flowers have evolved to have colors that are specifically suited to bees' color vision.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: This choice suggests that other insects with similar vision to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.

  C: This choice is irrelevant to the statement.
  D: This choice suggests that many nonflowering plants rely on bees.
  E: This choice suggests that present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  Therefore, B most strongly supports the statement.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This may suggest that bees' vision is unique and that flowers developed in response to it.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This does not support or contradict the statement.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This does not support or contradict the statement.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This does not support or contradict the statement.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This does not support or contradict the statement.
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to bees' unique vision.
  Therefore, A most strongly supports the statement.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This does not support the statement.

Thought: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If there is evidence that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, then it would support the statement.
  None of the choices provide evidence that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  Therefore, none of the choices support the statement.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Criticism: 
  Your logic is correct.
  None of the choices provide evidence that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  However, the question asks for the choice that most strongly supports the statement.
  Even if none of the choices provide strong support, one of them may provide the strongest support.
  Therefore, you should select the choice that provides the strongest support, even if it is not very strong.

This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that a diet based on fish is healthier than one based on red meat, but if everyone adopted this diet, it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  A: The argument presents evidence that taking vitamin E supplements reduces the risk of heart attack, but it has not been established that they are safe for everyone.
  B: The argument claims that governments can tax tobacco and spend the revenue on education, but if the taxes become too high, people might smoke less, reducing the funding for education.
  C: The argument claims that limiting purchases to what one needs and saving or investing the rest is better for the consumer, but if everyone did this, it would throw the economy into a severe recession, making saving and investing impossible for most people.
  D: The argument claims that if legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do their jobs, but if they did not campaign as much, they probably would not get reelected.
  E: The argument claims that restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve species, but it also reduces the proliferation of species that flourish in developed areas.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that a diet based on fish is healthier than one based on red meat, but if everyone adopted this diet, it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  The argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  A similar argument might be that a certain policy or action is desirable, but if everyone were to adopt it, it would lead to negative consequences that would make it impossible to implement.
  C is the closest argument to this reasoning, as it claims that a certain spending pattern is better for the consumer, but if everyone were to adopt it, it would throw the economy into a severe recession, making it impossible for most people to save and invest.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
Criticism: 
  The argument could also be seen as an example of the tragedy of the commons, where individuals acting in their own self-interest can lead to negative consequences for the group as a whole.
  Additionally, the argument assumes that everyone adopting the fish-based diet would lead to the extinction of marine species, which may not necessarily be the case.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that a fish-based diet is healthier than a red meat-based diet, but universal adoption of such a diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a dilemma where a healthier diet would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible to adopt the diet universally. 
  The reasoning is similar to the argument in which recommending vitamin E supplements is not safe for everyone, so it should not be recommended universally.
Criticism: 
  The reasoning in option A is not similar to the argument in the question. Option A presents a concern about the safety of vitamin E supplements, while the argument in the question presents a dilemma between adopting a healthier diet and preserving marine species.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that a fish-based diet is healthier than a red meat-based diet, but if everyone adopted this diet, it would lead to the extinction of marine species.

  The argument presents a dilemma where a healthier diet would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible to adopt the diet universally. 
  Therefore, the argument concludes that the universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
  The reasoning in option C is similar as it presents a dilemma where a spending pattern that is better for an individual would lead to a severe recession if everyone adopted it, making it impossible for most people to save and invest.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that this spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.
  The reasoning in option C is the most similar to the argument above.
Action: Answer("C")

Thought: 
  The argument presents a situation where a certain action is beneficial, but if everyone were to adopt it, it would lead to negative consequences. Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such an action.
  Option A presents a situation where a certain action is beneficial, but it has not been conclusively established that it is safe for all people. Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such an action.
  Option B presents a situation where a certain action is beneficial, but if it becomes too effective, it would lead to negative consequences. Therefore, the argument concludes that such an action might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as windows and decorations, are not banned.
  A: The argument is that moderation is not a useful concept because people have different reactions to substances.
  B: The argument is that banning a device because it causes cancer in laboratory animals is not reasonable because many chemicals cause cancer in high doses.
  C: The argument is that Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because 1,000 employees will retire.
  D: The argument is that engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the movie industry.
  E: The argument is that judging a movie's success based on profit relative to cost is misguided.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as windows and decorations, are not banned.
  The argument is that if the company is concerned about distractions, it should ban all distractions, not just non-work-related websites.
  Therefore, the argument is similar to D: engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the movie industry.
  The argument is that publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
Criticism: 
  The argument is not similar to A, B, C, or E.
  The argument in D is not about banning something, but rather about the idea that engaging characters do not guarantee a sale.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to increase productivity because other distractions, such as windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  A: The argument is that moderation is not a useful concept because people have different reactions to substances.
  B: The argument is that banning a device because it causes cancer in laboratory animals is not reasonable because most chemicals cause cancer in high doses.
  C: The argument is that Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because 1,000 employees are expected to retire.
  D: The argument is that engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the movie industry because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: The argument is that judging a film's success in terms of its profit relative to its cost is misguided because an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to increase productivity because other distractions, such as windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  The argument is that if website filtering software is necessary to increase productivity, then other distractions should also be blocked.
  Therefore, the argument is that website filtering software is not necessary to increase productivity.
  The argument in D is similar because it argues that engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the movie industry because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  The argument is that if engaging characters were necessary for a sale, then manuscripts that emphasize character would not be rejected.
  Therefore, the argument is that engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the movie industry.
  The answer is D.
Criticism: 
  The argument in D is not very similar to the employee's argument.
  The argument in D is about the movie industry and the rejection of manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  The employee's argument is about website filtering software and its necessity to increase productivity.
  A better answer would be E because it argues that judging a film's success in terms of its profit relative to its cost is misguided because an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie.
  The argument is that if profit relative to cost were the only criterion for success, then an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie.
  Therefore, the argument is that judging a film's success in terms of its profit relative to its cost is misguided.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to increase productivity because other distractions, such as windows and decorations, are not blocked.
  A: The argument is about moderation and how it fails to take into account biological differences.
  B: The argument is about banning a device due to its potential to cause cancer in laboratory animals.
  C: The argument is about the need for Acme to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: The argument is about the relationship between engaging characters and the sale of novels and stories.
  E: The argument is about the flawed criterion for judging a film's success in the movie industry.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to increase productivity because other distractions, such as windows and decorations, are not blocked.
  The argument is that if the company is going to block non-work-related websites, then it should also block other distractions that could potentially decrease productivity.
  Therefore, the argument is most similar in reasoning to D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  The argument is that while engaging characters are important, they do not guarantee a sale, just as blocking non-work-related websites does not guarantee increased productivity.
Criticism: 
  The argument is not about engaging characters and their relationship to the sale of novels and stories.
  The argument is about the need to block other distractions if the company is going to block non-work-related websites.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to increase productivity because other distractions, such as a lack of windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  A: The argument is that moderation is not a useful concept because people have different biological differences.
  B: The argument is that banning an electronic device because it causes cancer in laboratory animals is not reasonable because most chemicals cause cancer in high doses.
  C: The argument is that Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because it expects 1,000 employees to retire.
  D: The argument is that engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the creative writing industry.
  E: The argument is that judging a movie's success based on its profit relative to its cost is misguided because it does not take into account other factors.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to increase productivity because other distractions, such as a lack of windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  The argument is that if the company is going to block websites to increase productivity, it should also remove other distractions.
  Therefore, the argument is most similar to D: engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the creative writing industry.
  The argument is that if a writer wants to sell their work, they need to focus on more than just creating engaging characters.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace that are not being addressed.
  A: The argument is about moderation and how it fails to take into account biological differences.
  B: The argument is about banning a device due to its potential harm, but most chemicals cause cancer in high doses and are not banned.
  C: The argument is about the need for Acme to hire new employees due to expected retirements.
  D: The argument is about the importance of engaging characters in creative writing, but publishers and agents may still reject manuscripts that emphasize character.
  E: The argument is about how a movie's success is judged based on profit relative to cost, which may not accurately reflect its success.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace that are not being addressed.
  The argument is that the company's reasoning for installing the software is flawed because it does not address all potential distractions.
  Therefore, the most similar argument would be one where the reasoning for a proposed solution is flawed because it does not address all relevant factors.
  Option D is somewhat similar, as it argues that engaging characters are important but not sufficient for a manuscript to be successful.
  However, it is not a perfect match as it does not address a flawed reasoning for a proposed solution.
  Option B is also somewhat similar, as it argues that banning a device due to its potential harm is flawed because other substances that are not banned also cause harm.
  However, it is not a perfect match as it does not address a flawed reasoning for a proposed solution.
  Option A is not similar as it is about biological differences and moderation.
  Option C is not similar as it is about the need for new employees due to retirements.
  Option E is not similar as it is about the flawed criterion for judging a movie's success.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not a good way to increase productivity because other factors, such as a lack of windows or decorations, can be just as distracting.
  A: The argument is that moderation is not a good way to approach substances because people have different biological differences.
  B: The argument is that banning a device because it causes cancer in laboratory animals is not a good idea because most chemicals cause cancer in high doses.
  C: The argument is that Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because it expects 1,000 employees to retire.
  D: The argument is that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character.
  E: The argument is that judging a film's success based on its profit relative to its cost is misguided because an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be considered less successful.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not a good way to increase productivity because other factors, such as a lack of windows or decorations, can be just as distracting.
  The argument in option D is similar because it argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character.
  Both arguments suggest that a single factor is not enough to achieve a desired outcome.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Criticism: 
  There is no significant flaw in the logic used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

  Option D suggests that the level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes. This does not explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  Option E suggests that when taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily. This does not explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  Therefore, the most helpful option to explain the finding of the nicotine study is C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want.
  A recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Thought:
  The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  The study suggests that the amount of nicotine absorbed by the smoker is not dependent on the level of nicotine in the cigarette.
  Option A suggests that blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available. This supports the study's finding that the amount of nicotine absorbed by the smoker is not dependent on the level of nicotine in the cigarette.
  Option B suggests that smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes. This does not explain the finding of the nicotine study.
  Option C suggests that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities. This supports the study's finding that the amount of nicotine absorbed by the smoker is not dependent on the level of nicotine in the cigarette.
  Option D suggests that the level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes. This does not explain the finding of the nicotine study.
  Option E suggests that when taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily. This does not explain the finding of the nicotine study.
  Options A and C both support the study's finding that the amount of nicotine absorbed by the smoker is not dependent on the level of nicotine in the cigarette, but option C is a more general statement that applies to all cigarettes, not just low- and high-nicotine cigarettes.

B: This statement provides information about the wholesale price of beef and bread, but it does not explain why the price of beef would come close to doubling if grain prices double.
C: This statement provides information about the cost of producing bread and beef, but it does not explain why the price of beef would come close to doubling if grain prices double.
D: This statement suggests that most of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grain, which supports the phenomenon described in the context.
E: This statement provides information about the retail grocery outlets' purchasing practices, but it does not explain why the price of beef would come close to doubling if grain prices double.
Thought:
The context states that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling if grain prices double, and the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double. The statement in option D suggests that most of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grain. This means that if grain prices double, the cost of producing beef will increase significantly, which will lead to an increase in the price of beef. Therefore, option D is the most likely answer.
Criticism:
There is no significant flaw in the logic used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The researcher harvested lichens at sites with airborne copper pollution and compared the results with mechanical monitoring devices.
  The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available.
Thought:
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that lichens are a reliable and cost-effective alternative to mechanical monitoring devices.
  Option B supports the researcher's argument by stating that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales, which means that lichens can be used to monitor air quality in many different places.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about the accuracy or cost-effectiveness of lichens as a replacement for mechanical monitoring devices.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that lichens may not be effective in areas with minimal air pollution.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about the accuracy or cost-effectiveness of lichens as a replacement for mechanical monitoring devices.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide any information about the accuracy or cost-effectiveness of lichens as a replacement for mechanical monitoring devices.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The researcher harvested lichens at sites with airborne copper pollution and compared the results with mechanical monitoring devices.
  The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available.
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to find an option that supports the accuracy of lichens as a replacement for expensive pollution-monitoring devices.
  Option B states that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  This supports the researcher's argument that lichens can be used to monitor air pollution, as the researcher has already shown that lichens can accurately detect copper pollution.
  Therefore, option B most strengthens the researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The researcher claims that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion
  D: appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute
  E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")

The journalist is clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply. The journalist is arguing that withholding relevant information in interviews is not the same as lying, because lying actively encourages a false belief, while withholding information does not. The journalist is defending the moral principle that lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief, and is comparing it to the case of withholding information to show that this principle does not apply in that case. Therefore, the correct answer is E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  A: The effectiveness of antibiotics in treating stomach ulcers and tuberculosis is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The duration of the illnesses caused by H pylori and M tuberculosis is not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement supports the argument that M tuberculosis should not be considered a commensal, but it does not undermine the argument's reasoning.
  D: The number of people who harbor M tuberculosis or H pylori is not relevant to the argument.
  E: This statement undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that H pylori is more common than M tuberculosis, which weakens the argument's comparison between the two bacteria.
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  If there are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis, then the comparison between the two bacteria is weakened.
  Therefore, E undermines the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether Helicobacter pylori can be considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to Mycobacter tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis.
  The argument claims that no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal, even though only about 10% of people who harbor it get sick from it.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis.
  The argument claims that no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal, even though only about 10% of people who harbor it get sick from it.
  The argument assumes that the only reason to not call M tuberculosis a commensal is because it can cause tuberculosis.
  However, if there is another reason to not call M tuberculosis a commensal, then the argument's reasoning is undermined.
  Choice C provides another reason to not call M tuberculosis a commensal, which is that people who harbor it derive no benefit from its presence.
  Therefore, choice C most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  A: The effectiveness of antibiotics in treating stomach ulcers and tuberculosis is not relevant to the argument's reasoning.

  Therefore, the correct answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether or not H pylori should be considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that just because H pylori does not cause stomach ulcers in everyone who harbors it, it should not be considered a commensal.
  The argument uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample, claiming that just because not everyone who harbors M tuberculosis gets sick from it, it should not be considered a commensal.
Thought: 
  The argument is that just because not everyone who harbors H pylori gets stomach ulcers, it should not be considered a commensal.
  The argument uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample, claiming that just because not everyone who harbors M tuberculosis gets sick from it, it should not be considered a commensal.
  If there is a significant difference between H pylori and M tuberculosis that undermines the comparison, then the argument's reasoning is weakened.
  Choice C, that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, undermines the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  If M tuberculosis does not provide any benefits to the host, then it is not a commensal, and the comparison to H pylori is not valid.
  Therefore, choice C most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether or not H pylori should be considered a commensal.
  H pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers.
  Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which also causes illness in some people.
  The argument claims that no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
  The argument assumes that the only reason to consider a bacterium a commensal is if it provides a benefit to the host.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a reason why H pylori might still be considered a commensal even though it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  Choice C provides a reason why H pylori might still be considered a commensal even though it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether or not H pylori should be considered a commensal.
  The argument claims that just because H pylori only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of people who harbor it, and it allegedly strengthens immune response, it should not be considered a commensal.
  The argument uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample, since only about 10% of people who harbor it get sick from it, but no one would call it a commensal.
Thought: 
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal just because it only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of people who harbor it, and it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The counterexample is M tuberculosis, which only causes sickness in about 10% of people who harbor it, but no one would call it a commensal.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed because it is not clear why H pylori should be considered a commensal if M tuberculosis should not be considered a commensal.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that shows why H pylori should be considered a commensal while M tuberculosis should not be considered a commensal.
  A, B, and D are irrelevant to the argument.
  C is a possible answer because it suggests that people who harbor M tuberculosis do not derive any benefit from its presence, which could be a reason why it should not be considered a commensal while H pylori should be considered a commensal.
  E is also irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.
  However, you could also argue that the argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason to consider a bacterium a commensal is if it provides a benefit to the host, which may not be true.
  Additionally, the argument does not consider the fact that H pylori may provide some benefits to the host even if it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
Action: Answer("C")

Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  However, the fact that M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal even though only about 10% of people who harbor it get sick from it undermines this argument.
  If there is another reason why M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal, then the argument's reasoning is flawed.
  Therefore, we need to find an answer choice that provides another reason why M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal.
  Choice C provides such a reason by stating that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  If M tuberculosis does not provide any benefits to the host, then it cannot be considered a commensal.
  Therefore, choice C most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Principle: Any person or business knowingly aiding someone's infringement on a copyright is also guilty of copyright infringement. Application: Grandview Department Store, which features a self-service photo-printing kiosk, is guilty of copyright infringement since a customer using the kiosk infringed on a wedding photographer's copyright by printing photographs whose copyright is held by the photographer.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to justify the application of the principle?
Choices:
  A: The operator of a business has the same legal obligations to customers who use self-service facilities as it has to customers who use full-service facilities.
  B: The management of a business that is open to the public is obligated to report to the authorities any illegal activity that it witnesses on its property.
  C: The owner of a self-service printing kiosk should post a notice advising customers that copyrighted material should not be printed at the kiosk without the permission of the copyright holder.
  D: Owners of self-service facilities should monitor those facilities in order to ensure that they are not used for illegal or unethical purposes.
  E: A person or business providing a service that can be expected to be used to infringe on a copyright should be considered to knowingly aid any copyright infringer using the service. 15
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Copyright infringement occurs when someone uses or reproduces a copyrighted work without permission from the copyright holder.
- Anyone who knowingly aids someone's infringement on a copyright is also guilty of copyright infringement.
- Grandview Department Store is guilty of copyright infringement because a customer using its self-service photo-printing kiosk infringed on a wedding photographer's copyright.
Thought:
- The principle states that anyone who knowingly aids someone's infringement on a copyright is also guilty of copyright infringement.
- The application states that Grandview Department Store is guilty of copyright infringement because a customer using its self-service photo-printing kiosk infringed on a wedding photographer's copyright.
- Justifying the application of the principle requires an assumption that helps to connect the store's actions to the principle.
- Option A is irrelevant because it talks about legal obligations to customers, not copyright infringement.
- Option B is also irrelevant because it talks about reporting illegal activity, not aiding copyright infringement.
- Option C is not helpful because it suggests a solution to the problem, but it doesn't connect the store's actions to the principle.
- Option D is also not helpful because it talks about monitoring facilities, not aiding copyright infringement.
- Option E is the most helpful because it directly connects the store's provision of a service that can be used to infringe on a copyright to the principle that anyone who knowingly aids someone's infringement on a copyright is also guilty of copyright infringement.
- Therefore, the answer is E: A person or business providing a service that can be expected to be used to infringe on a copyright should be considered to knowingly aid any copyright infringer using the service.
Criticism:
- Option C could be seen as helpful because it suggests that the store should have posted a notice advising customers not to print copyrighted material without permission.
- However, this option still doesn't directly connect the store's actions to the principle, and it doesn't address the issue of the store knowingly aiding copyright infringement.
- Option E is still the most helpful assumption for justifying the application of the principle.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

  B: The fact that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  C: The fact that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  D: The fact that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  E: The fact that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
Criticism: 
  None of the options cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  The evidence cited is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  The options do not provide any information that would cast doubt on the validity of this evidence.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:

  Polar bears are claimed to navigate over considerable distances.
  Naturalists cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Thought: 
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  A: The fact that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  B: The fact that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  C: The fact that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  D: The fact that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  E: The fact that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  None of the options directly challenges the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  However, option B provides an alternative explanation for the polar bear's ability to return to its home territory, which is that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  Therefore, option B casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.

Knowledge: 
  Navigation in animals is the ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses.
  Polar bears are claimed to have the ability to navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence cited in support of the naturalists' claim is an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the option that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  If the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, it could indicate that the bear was not navigating but rather wandering aimlessly.
  If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it could indicate that the bear was following a familiar path rather than navigating.
  If the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, it could indicate that the bear was following natural cues rather than navigating.
  If polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, it could indicate that the bear's ability to navigate is not unique.
  If polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, it could indicate that the bear was not navigating but rather following its sense of smell.
  Option A, B, C, and E do not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Option D suggests that the polar bear's ability to navigate is not unique to polar bears and therefore casts doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.

  Navigation in animals is the ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses.
  Polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  Naturalists cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Thought: 
  The question asks which option casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  If the polar bear's ability to navigate over considerable distances is not the reason for its return, then the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim is not valid.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory. This implies that the polar bear was not using its navigational abilities to return home, but rather was relying on other factors.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This implies that the polar bear's return home may have been due to its annual migration route rather than its navigational abilities.
  Option C suggests that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice. This option does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Option D suggests that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances. This option does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Option E suggests that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory. This option does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries than in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  In Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument does not consider other factors that may contribute to colon cancer, such as genetics, lifestyle, or environmental factors.
  Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that there may be other factors that affect the incidence of colon cancer.
  Choice B is not a criticism of the argument, but rather a potential supporting argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument, as it does not address the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
  Choice D is not a criticism of the argument, but rather a potential refinement of the argument.
  Choice E is a potential criticism of the argument, as it suggests that other substances in fiber-rich foods may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, rather than fiber alone.
Criticism: 
  The argument overlooks the possibility that other factors may contribute to the incidence of colon cancer, such as genetics, lifestyle, or environmental factors.
  Therefore, the argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism.
Action: Answer("None of the above")

  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods.
  In Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument does not consider other factors that may contribute to colon cancer.
  Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism that it overlooks other possible causes of colon cancer.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument's claim that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  Choice E is a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning because it suggests that other substances in fiber-rich foods may contribute to preventing colon cancer, not just fiber.
Criticism: 
  Choice E is a possible criticism of the argument's reasoning because it suggests that other substances in fiber-rich foods may contribute to preventing colon cancer, not just fiber.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries than in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.

Thought: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries than in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that there may be other factors that contribute to the difference in colon cancer rates between Western and non-Western countries.
  For example, there may be differences in lifestyle, genetics, or environmental factors that affect the incidence of colon cancer.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, B, C, D, or E.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  The argument cites studies that show that colon cancer rates are lower in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.
  The argument also cites studies that show that colon cancer rates are lower in areas where people consume more cereals, which are high in fiber.
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  However, the argument overlooks the possibility that there may be other factors that contribute to the correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates.
  For example, it is possible that people who consume more fiber also engage in other healthy behaviors that reduce their risk of colon cancer.
  Therefore, the argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that there may be confounding variables that explain the correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates.
  Among the choices, the most relevant one is E, which suggests that foods containing fiber may also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer.
Criticism:
  The argument's reasoning is not necessarily vulnerable to criticism because it is possible that the studies cited in the argument have already controlled for confounding variables.
  Furthermore, the argument's conclusion is supported by multiple lines of evidence, which makes it less vulnerable to criticism.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer.
  The argument cites studies that show a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer rates.
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer.

  Therefore, the argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that the correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer rates may be due to other factors.
  Choice B is a possible criticism, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C is also a possible criticism, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is a possible criticism, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E is a possible criticism, but it does not directly address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A is the most likely criticism because it directly addresses the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer rates may be changing over time due to changes in dietary habits.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.

  Choice E is not relevant to the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  Choice A is relevant to the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. If the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably, then the correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer may not hold in the future.
Criticism: 
  The argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it is not necessarily true. 
  The argument assumes that there is a causal relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer, but it does not provide evidence to support this assumption.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that there are other factors that could be contributing to the correlation between fiber consumption and colon cancer.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity or in the wild.
Thought:
  The apparent discrepancy is that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity or in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  C: This statement suggests that predators are a significant threat to leatherbacks in the wild, which could explain why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity or in the wild.
Thought: 
  There is an apparent discrepancy between the fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity and yet have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity or in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  Choice C provides a reason why the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy. If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then the fatal diseases that leatherbacks are susceptible to in captivity may not be as significant a factor in determining their maximum life expectancy as predation is in the wild.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
Thought:
  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity and that they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild seems contradictory.
  Therefore, we need to find a statement that resolves this apparent discrepancy.
  Option A does not help to resolve the discrepancy because it talks about other large aquatic reptiles, not leatherbacks.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about the average life expectancy of sea turtles in general, not leatherbacks.
  Option C does not help to resolve the discrepancy because it talks about the cause of death of leatherbacks in the wild, not in captivity.
  Option D is also irrelevant because it talks about the knowledge of zoologists, not about the discrepancy.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the size of a leatherback, not about the discrepancy.
  None of the options seem to help resolve the discrepancy.
Criticism:
  The answer choices do not seem to provide any relevant information to resolve the discrepancy.
  However, it is possible that the answer is implied in the passage and not explicitly stated in the answer choices.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
Thought: 
  There is a discrepancy between the fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity and that they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice C suggests that the cause of death for most leatherbacks in the wild is not due to diseases, which could explain why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
Criticism: 
  The correct answer is a bit of a stretch. 
  While it is true that if most leatherbacks perish in the wild due to predators, then it would explain why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild, it is not a direct explanation for why the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity or in the wild.
Thought:
  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity could explain why they have a lower life expectancy in captivity.
  However, the passage states that leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity or in the wild.
  Therefore, there must be some other factor that is helping captive leatherbacks to reach their maximum life expectancy.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why captive leatherbacks are not dying from the fatal diseases they are susceptible to.
Evaluation:
  A: This answer choice provides information about other aquatic reptiles, but it does not help to explain why captive leatherbacks are not dying from fatal diseases.
  B: This answer choice provides information about sea turtles in general, but it does not help to explain why captive leatherbacks are not dying from fatal diseases.
  C: This answer choice provides information about the cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild, but it does not help to explain why captive leatherbacks are not dying from fatal diseases.
  D: This answer choice provides information about the difficulty of creating a suitable environment for captive leatherbacks, but it does not help to explain why captive leatherbacks are not dying from fatal diseases.
  E: This answer choice provides information about the age of leatherbacks, but it does not help to explain why captive leatherbacks are not dying from fatal diseases.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity or in the wild.
Thought:
  The apparent discrepancy is that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity or in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why leatherbacks are not affected by fatal diseases in the wild.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  C: This statement suggests that leatherbacks are more likely to die from predators in the wild than from diseases.
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Therefore, C is the most helpful statement in resolving the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
Thought:
  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity suggests that they would have a shorter lifespan in captivity.
  However, the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between these two facts.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice C suggests that predators are the main cause of death in the wild, which could explain why the susceptibility to diseases does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
Thought:
  The paradox is that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
  The correct answer should help to explain why leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
  A: This answer choice is irrelevant to the paradox.
  B: This answer choice is also irrelevant to the paradox.
  C: This answer choice suggests that predators are the main cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild, which could explain why leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
  D: This answer choice is irrelevant to the paradox.
  E: This answer choice is also irrelevant to the paradox.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
Criticism:
  There is no significant criticism to this answer.
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherback sea turtles are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
Thought: 
  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity suggests that they would have a shorter life expectancy in captivity than in the wild.
  However, the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both captivity and the wild.
  There must be some other factor that is offsetting the negative effects of captivity on leatherbacks.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the negative effects of captivity are not as significant as we might expect.
  Choice C provides a possible explanation: if most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then the risk of predation may be offsetting the negative effects of captivity on leatherbacks.
Criticism: 
  Choice A is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  Choice B provides a general fact about sea turtles, but it does not help to explain why leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice D suggests a reason why leatherbacks might not thrive in captivity, but it does not explain why they have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in the wild.
  The likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but they are also susceptible to fatal diseases in the wild. Therefore, this does not help to resolve the discrepancy.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C suggests that leatherbacks are killed by predators in the wild, which could explain why they do not live longer in the wild. However, this does not help to explain why they have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  Option D suggests that zoologists do not have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks. This could help to explain why leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but it does not help to explain why they have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  The argument suggests that there is a discrepancy between the susceptibility of leatherbacks to fatal diseases in captivity and in the wild, and their likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild. However, the argument does not provide any evidence to support this claim.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
- Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Thought:
- The journalist's statements indicate that the presence or absence of lithium in a celestial object's atmosphere is related to the object's mass and whether or not it has a fully functional nuclear furnace.
- The journalist does not state that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun, so A is not strongly supported.
- The journalist does state that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium in their atmospheres, but this does not necessarily mean that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements, so B is not strongly supported.
- The journalist does not state that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf, so C is not strongly supported.
- The journalist does not state that no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun, so D is not strongly supported.

- The journalist also states that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- The journalist further states that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- Finally, the journalist states that a brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
- From these statements, we can conclude that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements, and that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
- However, we cannot conclude that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun, or that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.

Criticism:
- The journalist's statements do not support choice A, as there may be other reasons why a celestial object does not have lithium in its atmosphere.
- The journalist's statements do support choice B, as any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere must have a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
- The journalist's statements do not support choice C, as there may be other reasons why a celestial object does not have lithium in its atmosphere.
- The journalist's statements do not support choice D, as there may be other celestial objects with lithium in their atmospheres that have less mass than the Sun.
- The journalist's statements do support choice E, as no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has been shown to have lithium in its atmosphere.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Thought: 
  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
  Therefore, any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  Therefore, any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is either a star with less mass than the Sun or a brown dwarf.
  Therefore, no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  Therefore, no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
  The statement "No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf" is not supported by the journalist's statements.
  The answer is E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic or reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
- Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Thought:
- The journalist states that brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- The journalist also states that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- The journalist further states that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- Finally, the journalist states that a brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
- Based on these statements, the most strongly supported option is B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.

Criticism:
- The journalist's statements do not support option A, which is too broad and does not take into account brown dwarfs.
- The journalist's statements do not support option C, which is too narrow and implies that brown dwarfs cannot exist.
- The journalist's statements do not support option D, which is incorrect because brown dwarfs have less mass than the Sun but can still have lithium in their atmospheres.
- The journalist's statements do not support option E, which is incorrect because there are celestial objects less massive than brown dwarfs that can have lithium in their atmospheres.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
- Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Thought:
- The journalist's statements suggest that the presence or absence of lithium in a celestial object's atmosphere is related to the object's mass and nuclear furnace.
- The journalist does not state that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun, so A is not strongly supported.
- The journalist does state that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete, so B is strongly supported.
- The journalist does not state that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf, so C is not strongly supported.
- The journalist does not state that no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun, so D is not strongly supported.
- The journalist does state that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere, so E is strongly supported.

Criticism:
- The journalist's statements are based on current scientific understanding, but they may not be universally accepted or may be subject to revision as new evidence emerges.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.

  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that people will buy the game after renting it.
  A: This option does not provide any information about whether people will buy the game after renting it.
  B: This option suggests that people will take longer to complete the game, which could mean that they will rent it multiple times before deciding to buy it.
  C: This option suggests that the publisher has a good reputation and a strong fan base, which could increase the likelihood of people buying the game after renting it.
  D: This option suggests that people may not play the game extensively after completing it, which could decrease the likelihood of people buying the game after renting it.
  E: This option suggests that some people may give the game away after completing it, which could decrease the likelihood of people buying the game after renting it.

Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.

Thought: 
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, the inflation rate increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The argument assumes that the party's economic theories were sound and that their implementation would have led to a decrease in the inflation rate. However, the argument does not consider other factors that could have contributed to the increase in the inflation rate.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument is that it assumes a causal relationship between the party's economic theories and the inflation rate without considering other factors that could have contributed to the increase in the inflation rate.
  The argument that most closely resembles this flawed reasoning is C, which assumes a causal relationship between the company's ability to sell its subsidiaries and the increase in its stock price without considering other factors that could have contributed to the increase in its stock price.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:

  D: The argument states that city residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels if the battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: The argument states that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Thought: 
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, inflation rate would have lessened. However, since the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  This is flawed reasoning because it assumes that the only reason for the increase in inflation rate is the party's economic theories being off the mark, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the increase.
  Option C has a similar flawed reasoning, assuming that the only reason for the stock price not increasing is the company's failure to sell its subsidiaries, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the stock price not increasing.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. 
Criticism: 
  The reasoning in option D is also flawed, assuming that the only reason for the residents' support for the rebels is the rebels winning the battle, without considering other factors that may have contributed to the residents' support.
  However, option C is still the best answer as it has the most similar flawed reasoning to the argument in the question.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate wetland development in Figoria to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that wetland development is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources and that wetland development is necessary for growth. 
  Therefore, a principle that supports the right of nations to govern their own resources would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  The principle that supports this position is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Criticism: 
  The principle that supports the Figorian Development Commission's position is not necessarily D. 
  D does not directly address the issue of a nation's right to govern its own resources.
  A more appropriate principle might be one that emphasizes a nation's sovereignty over its own resources.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development should be regulated in order to protect wildlife. They propose that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources and that wetland development is necessary for growth.
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources and that wetland development is necessary for growth. Therefore, the principle that would most strongly support their position is one that emphasizes the right of individual nations to govern their own resources and prioritize their own economic needs.
  A: This principle would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it suggests that national resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered, which is the opposite of what the Figorian Development Commission is arguing.
  B: This principle would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it suggests that the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations, which is the opposite of what the Figorian Development Commission is arguing.
  C: This principle would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it suggests that regulation should only be implemented after a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found, which is the opposite of what the Figorian Wildlife Commission is arguing.
  D: This principle would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it suggests that environmental regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment, which is the opposite of what the Figorian Development Commission is arguing.
  E: This principle would support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it suggests that it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources, which is consistent with the Figorian Development Commission's argument that wetland development is necessary for growth.
Conclusion: 
  The principle that would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position is E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate wetland development in Figoria to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission wants to allow wetland development in Figoria for economic growth.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that they have the right to govern their own resources.
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that they should be allowed to develop wetlands in Figoria for economic growth.
  They believe that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  Therefore, the principle that would most strongly support their position is one that emphasizes a nation's right to govern its own resources.
  The principle that best fits this description is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Criticism: 
  The principle that supports the Figorian Development Commission's position is not necessarily the best principle for protecting wildlife and the environment.
  The principle that supports the Figorian Development Commission's position is more focused on a nation's right to govern its own resources rather than on protecting wildlife and the environment.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development should be regulated to protect wildlife by offsetting development with the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that wetland development is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources and that wetland development is necessary for growth.
  Therefore, a principle that supports the right of nations to govern their own resources would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  The only choice that supports this principle is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Criticism:
  While choice D does support the principle of a nation's right to govern its own resources, it does not directly address the issue of wetland development or the protection of wildlife.
  Therefore, another choice could be a better answer depending on how the question is interpreted.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that wetland development should be regulated in order to protect wildlife and that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources, and that wetland development is necessary for growth. Therefore, a principle that supports the idea that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  A: This principle suggests that national resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered, which does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  B: This principle suggests that the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations, which does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  C: This principle suggests that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found, which does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  D: This principle suggests that environmental regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment, which does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  E: This principle suggests that it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources, which does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Therefore, none of the principles strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Criticism: 
  The answer is not clear-cut, as none of the principles strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position. However, if we had to choose one, it would be A, as it suggests that national resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered, which could be interpreted as limiting Figoria's right to govern its own resources.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that wetland development should be regulated in order to protect wildlife. They propose that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that wetland development is necessary for growth and that they have the right to govern their own resources.
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that they should be allowed to develop wetlands because they have the right to govern their own resources and because wetland development might not affect wildlife. 
  Therefore, the principle that would most strongly support their position is one that emphasizes the right of individual nations to govern their own resources.
  Choice D suggests that environmental regulation must aim to prevent any further environmental damage and cannot allow for different degrees of harm caused by different nations. This principle would not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it would suggest that Figoria should be subject to the same regulations as other nations that have already harmed the environment.
  Choice E suggests that it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources. While this principle might be relevant to the debate, it does not directly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice A suggests that national resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered. This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, not the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice B suggests that the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations. This principle would also support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, not the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice C suggests that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found. This principle might support the Figorian Development Commission's position, as it suggests that regulation should only be implemented when there is evidence of harm to wildlife. 
  However, this principle does not directly address the issue of Figoria's right to govern its own resources. 
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage. 
Criticism: 
  While choice C might support the Figorian Development Commission's position, it is not a strong argument in favor of their position. 
  The principle suggests that regulation should only be implemented when there is evidence of harm to wildlife, but it does not address the issue of Figoria's right to govern its own resources. 
  Therefore, it is possible that another principle might more strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The biologist argues that humans could have had six fingers per hand if they had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
- The biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
- The biologist argues that our prejudices lead us to believe that our configuration of fingers is the best.
Thought:
- The biologist's argument is that humans could have had six fingers per hand if they had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
- The argument is that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
- Therefore, if there is evidence that humans are content with other configurations of fingers, it would strengthen the biologist's argument.
- Choice A does not strengthen the argument because it does not provide evidence that humans are content with other configurations of fingers.
- Choice B weakens the argument because it suggests that humans are never content with two things of unequal usefulness, which contradicts the biologist's argument.
- Choice C does not strengthen the argument because it is a general statement that does not provide evidence that humans are content with other configurations of fingers.
- Choice D strengthens the argument because it suggests that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is based on our prejudices, which supports the biologist's argument that our configuration of fingers is not inherently better than other configurations.
- Choice E does not strengthen the argument because it only provides evidence that a fish with six phalanges in its fins exists, but it does not provide evidence that humans could have had six fingers per hand.
Criticism:
- Choice D strengthens the argument, but it does not directly provide evidence that humans are content with other configurations of fingers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have had six fingers per hand if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  A: This statement does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is based on our prejudices rather than any inherent usefulness.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans could have had six fingers per hand if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have had six fingers per hand if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  The biologist suggests that our perception of the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is based on our prejudices rather than any inherent usefulness.
  If there is evidence that our perception of the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is based on our prejudices rather than any inherent usefulness, then this would support the biologist's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Criticism: 
  This statement is not necessarily true, and it is difficult to prove or disprove.
  Additionally, the statement does not directly support the biologist's argument that humans could have had six fingers per hand if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers we have is not necessarily the most useful configuration.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective facts.
  E: This statement is relevant to the biologist's argument because it suggests that the configuration of fingers the biologist describes is possible.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that our current configuration of fingers is not necessarily the most useful.
  The argument is based on the idea that our current configuration is not inherently better than other possible configurations.
  The argument is also based on the idea that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective facts.
  If there is evidence that other configurations are possible, then this would support the biologist's argument.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the most useful configuration, and that humans would be content with other configurations.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective facts.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans might not be content with a different configuration of fingers, since at least one species of fish has a different configuration.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that humans would be content with a different configuration of fingers.
  If humans have been content with our current configuration of fingers because we believe it is the most useful, then the biologist's argument is weakened.
  If humans have not been content with our current configuration of fingers because we believe it is the most useful, then the biologist's argument is strengthened.
  Statement D suggests that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective facts, which supports the biologist's argument.
  Therefore, statement D most strengthens the biologist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have had a different number of fingers and still be content with that configuration.
  A: This statement does not support the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on objective facts.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that humans could have evolved to have six fingers if a fish with six phalanges in its fins existed.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have had a different number of fingers and still be content with that configuration.
  If the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices, then it is possible that humans could be content with a different number of fingers.
  Therefore, D strengthens the biologist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if we had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
- The biologist argues that our current configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than other possible configurations.
- The biologist suggests that humans would be content with a different configuration of fingers if we had evolved that way.
Thought:
- The biologist's argument is based on the idea that our current configuration of fingers is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations.
- To strengthen this argument, we need evidence that supports the idea that humans are content with things that are not inherently better or worse than alternatives.
- Option C suggests that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness, which supports the biologist's argument.
Criticism:
- Option C is too strong of a statement. It is unlikely that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
- The biologist's argument is also based on the idea that humans are not inherently biased towards our current configuration of fingers. Option D provides some support for this idea, but it is not as strong as Option C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the best or most useful configuration.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective facts.
  E: This statement supports the biologist's argument by providing evidence that a fish with six phalanges in its fins exists, which strengthens the argument that humans could have evolved with six fingers.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the best or most useful configuration.
  The argument is based on the idea that our current configuration of fingers is not inherently better than other possible configurations.
  The biologist suggests that if humans had evolved from a fish with six phalanges in its fins, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
  Choice D supports the argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective facts.
  Choice E supports the argument by providing evidence that a fish with six phalanges in its fins exists, which strengthens the argument that humans could have evolved with six fingers.
  Choice E is more directly relevant to the argument, as it provides evidence that supports the idea that humans could have evolved with six fingers.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the best or most useful configuration.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not necessarily accurate.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument because it suggests that humans could have evolved to have six fingers if a fish with six phalanges in its fins existed.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that our configuration of fingers is not necessarily the best or most useful.
  If our configuration of fingers is not necessarily the best or most useful, then it is possible that another configuration could be just as useful.
  If the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices, then it is possible that another configuration could be just as useful.
  Therefore, D most strengthens the biologist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")

  Statement D supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on objective facts.
  Therefore, statement D most strengthens the biologist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if they had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
- The biologist argues that our current configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than other possible configurations.
- The biologist implies that humans would be equally content with a different configuration of fingers if they had evolved that way.
Thought:
- The biologist's argument is based on the idea that the usefulness of our fingers is not inherent, but rather a product of our evolutionary history.
- To strengthen this argument, we need evidence that supports the idea that our current configuration of fingers is not inherently better than other possible configurations.
- Option D suggests that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is a result of our prejudices, which supports the biologist's argument.
- Option E is interesting, but it does not directly strengthen the biologist's argument. It only provides additional information that is not directly relevant to the argument.
- Options A, B, and C are not relevant to the argument and do not provide evidence to support the idea that our current configuration of fingers is not inherently better than other possible configurations.
Criticism:
- Option D is not entirely accurate. While our perception of the usefulness of our fingers may be influenced by our prejudices, there are also objective reasons why our current configuration of fingers is useful (e.g. the ability to grasp objects).
- Option E is not directly relevant to the argument, but it could be indirectly relevant if it suggests that there are many different possible configurations of fingers that could be equally useful.

  Therefore, principle C is the most valid principle that helps to justify the argument above.
  The answer is C: Ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful.
Criticism:
  The argument does not claim that dried parsley should never be used because it is an ingredient that should never be used in cooking. 
  Instead, the argument claims that dried parsley should never be used because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  Therefore, principle C is not the most valid principle that helps to justify the argument above.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  A: This principle suggests that fresh ingredients should be used whenever possible, but it does not directly address the argument about dried parsley.
  B: This principle suggests that only the tastiest ingredients should be used, but it does not directly address the argument about dried parsley.
  C: This principle suggests that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful, which supports the argument about dried parsley.
  D: This principle is too specific to parsley and does not address the broader argument about dried parsley.
  E: This principle directly supports the argument that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Thought:
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  Principle C suggests that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful, which supports the argument about dried parsley.
  Therefore, Principle C most clearly helps to justify the argument above.
  The answer is C.
Criticism:
  The argument does not claim that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it should never be used in cooking. It claims that it should never be used because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley. So, Principle C is not the most accurate justification for the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
Thought:
  The argument is based on the premise that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.

  Therefore, the answer is A: Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
Criticism:
  The argument does not claim that only the tastiest ingredients should be used in cooking, so B is not the best answer.
  The argument also does not claim that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful, so C is not the best answer.
  The argument is specifically about parsley, so D is not the best answer.
  The argument is not a general claim that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients, so E is not the best answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
Thought:
  The argument is based on the premise that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  The principle that would most clearly help to justify the argument is that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
Criticism:
  The argument does not claim that only fresh ingredients should be used in cooking, but rather that dried parsley is inferior to fresh parsley.
  Therefore, the principle that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible is not the most clear justification for the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  A: The principle of using fresh ingredients in cooking is mentioned in the argument, but it is not the main point.
  B: The argument mentions taste, but it does not say that only the tastiest ingredients should be used.
  C: This principle is similar to the argument, but it is too broad and does not specifically address parsley.
  D: This principle is similar to the argument, but it is too narrow and only addresses parsley.
  E: This principle is the most similar to the argument, as it directly compares dried and fresh ingredients.
Thought:
  The argument claims that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  The principle that best justifies this argument is that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Criticism:
  The argument only talks about parsley, not all dried ingredients.
  The principle could be applied to other ingredients, but it is not explicitly stated in the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:

  B: This principle argues that only the tastiest ingredients should ever be used in cooking.
  C: This principle argues that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful.
  D: This principle argues that parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking.
  E: This principle argues that in cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  Principle E states that in cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
  Therefore, Principle E most clearly helps to justify the argument above.
  The answer is E.
Criticism: 
  The argument does not claim that all dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients, only that dried parsley is inferior to fresh parsley.
  Therefore, Principle E may not be the most valid principle to justify the argument.
  However, it is still the most relevant principle among the given options.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The detective presumes that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary.
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
Thought:
  A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized, it would be less likely that one of them could have embezzled money without being detected. This weakens the detective's argument.
  B: If someone outside the corporation had access to internal financial records, it would be possible for them to embezzle money without being an accountant or an actuary. This weakens the detective's argument.
  C: This fact does not directly weaken the detective's argument.
  D: The fact that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement does not directly weaken the detective's argument.
  E: If security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records, it would be less likely that one of them could have embezzled money. This weakens the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
Criticism:
  The fact that XYZ Corporation employs more accountants than actuaries does not directly weaken the detective's argument. However, it does not support the detective's argument either.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The detective presumes that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary.
  The detective believes that an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: This weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that the accountants were more closely scrutinized and therefore less likely to have committed the crime.
  B: This weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that someone outside of XYZ Corporation could have committed the crime.
  C: This does not weaken the detective's argument because it does not address the likelihood of an accountant committing the crime.
  D: This does not weaken the detective's argument because it does not address the likelihood of an accountant committing the crime.
  E: This weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that the actuaries may not have had access to the internal financial records.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
Criticism:
  I do not see any flaws in the above analysis.
Action: Answer("C")

Thought: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A weakens the argument because it suggests that the accountants could have been responsible for the embezzlement.
  B weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside the company could have had access to the internal financial records.
  C weakens the argument because it suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, making it more likely that an accountant was responsible for the embezzlement.
  D weakens the argument because it suggests that the company was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place, which could mean that the embezzler was not an employee of the company.
  E weakens the argument because it suggests that the actuaries may not have had access to the internal financial records.
  Therefore, none of the choices except D strengthens the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("D")

Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely an actuary because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized than the activities of the accountants, it would weaken the detective's argument because it would suggest that the accountants could have had the opportunity to embezzle.
  B: If there is evidence of breaches in computer security that could have given outsiders access to internal financial records, it would weaken the detective's argument because it would suggest that the embezzler could have been someone outside the company.
  C: The number of accountants and actuaries employed by XYZ Corporation is not relevant to the detective's argument.
  D: The fact that an independent report concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement does not weaken the detective's argument.
  E: If certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, it would weaken the detective's argument because it would suggest that the actuaries did not have the opportunity to embezzle.
  Therefore, the answer is D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

Thought: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A weakens the argument because it suggests that the accountants were more closely scrutinized than the actuaries, which could have led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  B weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside of XYZ Corporation could have had access to the internal financial records, which means that the embezzler could have been someone other than an accountant or an actuary.
  C weakens the argument because it suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, which means that it is more likely that the embezzler is an accountant.
  D does not weaken the argument because it is not relevant to the detective's reasoning.
  E weakens the argument because it suggests that it is more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, which means that it is less likely that the embezzler is an actuary.
  Therefore, the answer is D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:

  The detective presumes that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary.
  The detective argues that an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
Thought: 
  We need to find the option that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  A: If the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized, it would make it less likely that one of them was the embezzler. This weakens the detective's argument.
  B: If persons outside XYZ Corporation had access to internal financial records, it would mean that the embezzler could have been someone other than an accountant or an actuary. This weakens the detective's argument.
  C: The number of accountants and actuaries employed by XYZ Corporation does not directly affect the detective's argument.
  D: The independent report does not directly affect the detective's argument.
  E: If it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records, it would make it less likely that one of them was the embezzler. This weakens the detective's argument.
  Only options A, B, and E could weaken the detective's argument. Option C and D are irrelevant. Option B and E weaken the detective's argument. Option A does not weaken the detective's argument. Therefore, the answer is A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.

Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone.
  B: I have no reason to think that the practical joke I want to play would harm anyone. So, since the joke would show no contempt for the person the joke is played on, it would not be wrong for me to play it.
  C: Because of the circumstances, it would be wrong for me to play the practical joke I had intended to play on you. Even though it would not show contempt for anyone, it could easily bring you significant harm.
  D: It would have been wrong for me to play the practical joke that I had intended to play on you. Even though I did not have reason to think that it would significantly harm anyone, I did think that it would show contempt for someone.

  B: The speaker believes that the practical joke would not harm anyone, so the principle would not support the reasoning in this argument.
  C: The speaker acknowledges that the practical joke could easily bring significant harm to someone, but it would not show contempt for anyone, so the principle would not support the reasoning in this argument.
  D: The speaker acknowledges that the practical joke would show contempt for someone, so the principle would support the reasoning in this argument.
  E: The speaker acknowledges that someone was harmed as a result of the practical joke, but it did not show contempt for the person the joke was played on, so the principle would not support the reasoning in this argument.
  Therefore, the principle stated above would most help to justify the reasoning in argument D.
  The answer is D: It would have been wrong for me to play the practical joke that I had intended to play on you. Even though I did not have reason to think that it would significantly harm anyone, I did think that it would show contempt for someone.
Criticism: 
  The reasoning in argument A is also supported by the principle stated above, as the speaker acknowledges that the practical joke would bring significant harm to someone.
  However, the reasoning in argument D is more directly supported by the principle, as the speaker acknowledges that the practical joke would show contempt for someone.
  So, the answer could also be A, but D is a more direct application of the principle.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
Thought:
  Movie executives want to maximize the number of people who see a film to generate revenues from ticket sales.
  Television executives do not want to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  Option A is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option B is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option C is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option D is relevant because it explains that television executives are concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show because sponsors make their profits from them.
  Option E is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
Criticism:
  The explanation in option D is not the only reason why television executives do not want to maximize the number of viewers for their shows. There could be other reasons such as the type of content, target audience, and competition.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Movie executives aim to maximize the number of people who see a film to make a profit.
  Television executives do not aim to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
    This choice does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
    This choice does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
    This choice explains the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives. Since the cost of producing a film is much greater than the cost of producing an hour of television, movie executives need to maximize the number of people who see a film to make a profit. In contrast, television executives can make a profit with fewer viewers because the cost of producing a television show is much lower.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
    This choice does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
    This choice does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
Thought:
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film to make a profit.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  The cost of producing a film is much greater than the cost of producing an hour of television.
  Therefore, the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives is explained by the fact that movie executives need to maximize the number of people who see a film to make a profit, while television executives can make a profit with fewer viewers because the cost of producing a television show is much lower.

  Option A is not relevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option B is not relevant to the goals of movie and television executives.

  Option D suggests that television executives are more concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show, which could explain why they do not want to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  Option E is not relevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Option C and D could both explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives, but option D is more directly related to the goals of television executives.

  Option B is not relevant to the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Option C is not relevant to the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.

  Option E is not relevant to the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

  Movie executives want to maximize the number of people who see a film because it generates revenues from ticket sales.
  Television executives do not have the same goal because they make their profits from sponsors who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  Therefore, the correct answer should explain why television executives are not concerned with maximizing the number of viewers.
  Choice D explains that television shows make their profits from sponsors who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  This means that television executives are more concerned with attracting viewers who have higher purchasing power, rather than maximizing the number of viewers.
  Therefore, D is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  The argument assumes that the primary goal of television executives is to make profits from sponsors.
  However, this may not always be the case, as some television executives may prioritize other goals such as critical acclaim or social impact.
  Additionally, the argument assumes that the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film, but this may not always be the case as well.

  Option C could be relevant because if the cost of producing a film is much greater than the cost of producing an hour of television, then the movie executives would need to maximize the number of people who see the film to make a profit. Whereas, television executives may not need to maximize the number of viewers to make a profit.
  Option D could be relevant because if television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show, then television executives may not need to maximize the number of viewers to make a profit.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

  Choice A: Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. If he could not have reasonably foreseen this, he should not be blamed for it. This aligns with the principle stated in the passage.
  Choice B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. If she could not have reasonably foreseen this, she should not be blamed for it. This aligns with the principle stated in the passage.
  Choice C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. This does not align with the principle stated in the passage because Gougon was concerned that it might make his guests ill, indicating that he could have reasonably foreseen the possibility.
  Choice D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine and did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. If he could not have reasonably foreseen this, he should not be blamed for it. This aligns with the principle stated in the passage.
  Choice E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, which any reasonable person could have foreseen would start a fire. This does not align with the principle stated in the passage because any reasonable person could have foreseen the possibility.
Conclusion: 
  Choices A, B, and D align with the principle stated in the passage. 
  Choices C and E do not align with the principle stated in the passage.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage argues that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if they could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Thought: 
  Choice A describes a situation where Riley did not foresee the traffic accident, but he should have been able to foresee it if he had thought about it. Therefore, he should be blamed for it.
  Choice B describes a situation where Oblicek had no reason to foresee the bankruptcy of her brother's business, and thus should not be blamed for it.
  Choice C describes a situation where Gougon was concerned that the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, but had no reason to think that it would. Therefore, he should not be blamed for it.
  Choice D describes a situation where Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know that the wrong medicine would cause the patient's increased blood pressure. Therefore, he should not be blamed for it.
  Choice E describes a situation where Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, which any reasonable person could have foreseen would start a fire. Therefore, she should be blamed for it.
  The principles in the passage support the reasoning in choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The principles state that a person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it, but a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if they could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Thought: 
  A: Riley parked his car in the center lane of Main Street, which could lead to a traffic accident. Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to him. Therefore, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek suggested to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business, but she had no idea that it was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt. She could not have reasonably foreseen this. Therefore, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon served hollandaise sauce to his guests, which made them ill. He had no reason to think that it would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Therefore, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, which caused the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. He did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves on Rodriguez's farm, which started a fire. Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.
  The reasoning in A and B aligns with the principles stated. The reasoning in C, D, and E does not align with the principles stated.
Action: Answer("A")

  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. Therefore, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine and did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves on Rodriguez's farm and started a fire. Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

  The argument is that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant, making trial by jury unfair for disputes involving such issues.
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.
Thought: 
  The argument is that trial by jury is not fair for disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries.
  Option A weakens the argument because it suggests that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony, even if it is explained to them.
  Option B does not weaken the argument because it suggests that jurors with specialized knowledge may be biased.
  Option C is irrelevant because it suggests that appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Option D is also irrelevant because it discusses how experts hedge their conclusions, not how juries are selected.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it discusses the cost of expert witnesses, not how juries are selected.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. Option A weakens the argument by suggesting that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony, even if it is explained to them.

  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.
Thought: 
  The argument is that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are systematically excluded from juries.
  If it is true that the more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given, then it would strengthen the argument.
  If it is true that the more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins, then it would strengthen the argument.
  If it is true that appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues, then it is irrelevant to the argument.
  If it is true that experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error, then it would weaken the argument.
  If it is true that expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services, then it is irrelevant to the argument.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after exposure to a microorganism, then they have an immunity to that microorganism.
  The student then argues that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms.
Thought:
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity to staphylococcus.
  However, it is possible for a person to be exposed to staphylococcus and not develop harmful symptoms without having an immunity to staphylococcus.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to option C, which assumes that taking medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms.
Criticism:
  The criticism is that the student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity to staphylococcus.
  However, it is possible for a person to be exposed to staphylococcus and not develop harmful symptoms without having an immunity to staphylococcus.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they must have an immunity to that microorganism.
  The argument is flawed because not developing symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has immunity to the microorganism.
  A: The argument is not about morality or justice.
  B: The argument is not about advertising or fiction.
  C: The argument is not about medication or illness.
  D: The argument is not about taxation or business expansion.
  E: The argument is not about hand washing or disease prevention.
Thought: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that not developing harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism means that a person has immunity to that microorganism.
  However, it is possible for a person to not develop symptoms even if they do not have immunity to the microorganism.
  This flawed pattern of reasoning is similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in option C, where it assumes that because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, Isabel must not have taken the medication because she is still ill.
  Just as not taking medication does not necessarily mean that a person will not be cured or their symptoms alleviated, not developing harmful symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has immunity to a microorganism.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to option C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person has an immunity to a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms.
  The student argues that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms.
Thought: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to the microorganism. This is not necessarily true, as there are other factors that can contribute to a lack of symptoms, such as a low dose of the microorganism or a strong immune system. This flawed pattern of reasoning is most similar to option C, which assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and therefore concludes that Isabel did not take the medication because she is still quite ill. This is flawed because there are other reasons why Isabel might still be ill, such as an incorrect diagnosis or an ineffective medication. 
  Therefore, the answer is C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person has an immunity to a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms.
  The student argues that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms.
Thought:
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity to staphylococcus.
  This is similar to answer choice C, which assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and therefore concludes that Isabel did not take the medication because she is still ill.
Criticism: 
  The student's argument is flawed because exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has an immunity to staphylococcus.
  It is possible that the person has an immunity, but it is also possible that the person was not exposed to a sufficient amount of the microorganism, or that their immune system was able to fight off the infection.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person has an immunity to a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms.
  The student argues that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms.
Thought: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity to the microorganism. However, this is not necessarily true, as some people may simply not be susceptible to the harmful effects of the microorganism for other reasons.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is most similar to that in option C, which assumes that medication always cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and therefore concludes that Isabel did not take the medication because she is still quite ill.
Criticism: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity to the microorganism. However, this is not necessarily true, as some people may simply not be susceptible to the harmful effects of the microorganism for other reasons.
  Option A is flawed because it assumes that everything morally right is just, which is not necessarily true.
  Option B is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
  Option D is flawed because it assumes that excessive taxation is the only reason why business owners become less willing to expand their businesses, which is not necessarily true.
  Option E is flawed because it assumes that doctors' hand-washing practices are the only factor affecting disease prevention, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they must have an immunity to that microorganism.
  The argument is flawed because not developing harmful symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has an immunity to the microorganism.
  A: This argument is about the relationship between morality and serving the interests of everyone. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  B: This argument is about whether writers of fiction try to persuade people that certain claims are true. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  C: This argument is about whether Isabel took her medication. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  D: This argument is about the relationship between business expansions and taxes. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  E: This argument is about the value of hand washing in preventing disease. It is not similar to the student's argument.
Thought: 
  The student's argument is flawed because not developing harmful symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has an immunity to the microorganism.
  The argument assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to the microorganism.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning is most similar to an argument that assumes a relationship between two things without sufficient evidence.
  The argument in choice C assumes that Isabel did not take her medication because she is still quite ill, without considering other possible reasons for her illness.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they must have an immunity to that microorganism.
  This argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to a microorganism is the only way to develop immunity to it.
  A: This argument is about the relationship between morality and serving the interests of everyone.
  B: This argument is about whether writers of fiction try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: This argument is about whether Isabel took medication or not.
  D: This argument is about the relationship between taxation and business expansion.
  E: This argument is about the value of hand-washing in preventing disease.
Thought: 
  The student's argument assumes that exposure to a microorganism is the only way to develop immunity to it.
  This is similar to assuming that the only way to persuade people that certain claims are true is through advertising.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to B.
Criticism: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to a microorganism is the only way to develop immunity to it.
  However, immunity can also be acquired through vaccination or previous infection.
  The argument in B is flawed because it assumes that writers of fiction never try to persuade people that certain claims are true, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person has an immunity to a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms.
  The student argues that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms.
Thought: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to the microorganism. This is not necessarily true because some people may have developed harmful symptoms in the past or may develop them in the future. 
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill. This argument assumes that medication is the only way to cure a disease or alleviate its symptoms, which is not necessarily true. 
Criticism: 
  The criticism is that the student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to the microorganism. This is not necessarily true because some people may have developed harmful symptoms in the past or may develop them in the future. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person is not affected by a microorganism, then they have an immunity to it.
  The student argues that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms.
Thought:
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to it.
  This is flawed because there are other reasons why a person may not develop harmful symptoms, such as the person's immune system being able to fight off the infection.
  This flawed pattern of reasoning is most similar to option C, which assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and therefore, Isabel must not have taken the medication because she is still ill.
Criticism: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to it.
  This is flawed because there are other reasons why a person may not develop harmful symptoms, such as the person's immune system being able to fight off the infection.
  However, the argument is not similar to any of the given options.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The journalist argues that a critique of a book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims.
  The physician who criticized the book is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  The journalist suggests that the physician's employment with the company may bias their critique of the book.
Thought:
  The journalist's argument is that the physician's critique is biased because of their employment with the company that manufactures the drug.
  The argument assumes that the physician's critique is biased and therefore not legitimate.
  However, the argument does not consider the possibility that the physician's critique may be unbiased and legitimate despite their employment with the company.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  The answer is D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
Criticism:
  None. The answer is well-supported by the reasoning provided. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims.
  The physician who criticized the book is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  The journalist assumes that the physician has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
Thought:
  The journalist's argument is vulnerable to criticism because it assumes that the physician's critique is biased and therefore not legitimate.
  This assumption is based on the physician's employment with the company that manufactures the drug.
  However, the journalist does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
  Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes for granted that anyone associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  The answer is B.
Criticism:
  The journalist's argument could also be vulnerable to criticism on other grounds.
  For example, the argument assumes that the critique only concerns the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects, but it is possible that the critique calls into question other claims made in the book.
  Therefore, answer choice A could also be a valid criticism of the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist argues that a critique of a book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects is not legitimate because the physician who provided the critique is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  A: This choice suggests that the critique may have called into question other claims made in the book, but this is not relevant to the journalist's argument.
  B: This choice suggests that the journalist assumes that anyone associated with a drug company is biased, but this is not necessarily the case.
  C: This choice suggests that the author of the book may have been biased, but this is not relevant to the journalist's argument.
  D: This choice suggests that the journalist fails to consider the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may still provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim, which is a potential criticism of the journalist's argument.
  E: This choice suggests that the journalist overlooks the possibility that a critique may not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim for reasons other than personal biases, but this is not relevant to the journalist's argument.
Thought: 
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects is not legitimate because the physician who provided the critique is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  This assumes that the physician is biased and unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of the drug.
  However, it is possible that the physician may still provide legitimate grounds for denying the claim.
  Therefore, the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  The answer is D.

  B: The argument assumes that anyone associated with a drug company is unable to weigh evidence fairly.
  C: The argument does not address the possibility of bias on the part of the book's author.
  D: The argument does not address the possibility that someone with personal reasons to deny a claim may still provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: The argument does not address the possibility that a critique may fail to provide legitimate grounds for rejecting a claim for reasons other than personal biases of the author.
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book is not legitimate because the physician who provided the critique is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  This assumes that the physician is biased and unable to weigh evidence fairly.
  However, it is possible that the physician is able to provide legitimate grounds for denying the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects, despite being employed by the drug company.
  Therefore, the journalist's argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  The answer is D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct.
  However, it is also possible to criticize the journalist's argument on the grounds that it assumes that the physician's critique is biased without providing any evidence to support this assumption.
  Therefore, the answer could also be B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
Action: Answer("D")

  B: This choice suggests that the journalist takes for granted that anyone associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: This choice suggests that the author of the book may have been biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: This choice suggests that the journalist fails to address the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: This choice suggests that the journalist overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Thought: 
  The journalist argues that the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims because the physician who critiqued the book is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  However, the journalist assumes that the physician is biased and unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  This assumption may not be true in all cases.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it takes for granted that anyone associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  The answer is B.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims.
  The physician who criticized the book is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  The journalist assumes that the physician's employment with the company creates a personal bias that would lead him to deny that the drug is dangerous.
Thought:
  The journalist's argument is that the physician's critique of the book is not legitimate because he has a personal bias.
  The argument assumes that the physician's employment with the company creates a personal bias that would lead him to deny that the drug is dangerous.
  However, it is possible that the physician's critique is legitimate, even if he is employed by the company.
  Therefore, the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  The answer is D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The journalist argues that a critique of a book claiming a new drug has dangerous side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims.
  The critique was made by a prominent physician who is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
Choices:
  A: This choice is not relevant to the journalist's argument and does not criticize the reasoning presented.
  B: This choice criticizes the journalist's argument by suggesting that it assumes that anyone associated with a drug company cannot weigh evidence fairly. This is a potential flaw in the journalist's argument.
  C: This choice is not relevant to the journalist's argument and does not criticize the reasoning presented.
  D: This choice is not relevant to the journalist's argument and does not criticize the reasoning presented.
  E: This choice is not relevant to the journalist's argument and does not criticize the reasoning presented.
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
  The physician who made the critique is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  The journalist suggests that the physician's employment creates a personal bias that undermines the critique's legitimacy.
  This argument assumes that anyone associated with a drug company cannot weigh evidence fairly.
  This is a potential flaw in the journalist's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The journalist argues that a critique of a book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
  The physician who provided the critique is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  A: The argument does not address other claims made in the book.
  B: The argument assumes that anyone associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: The argument does not address the possibility that the author of the book was biased in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: The argument does not address the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: The argument does not address the possibility that a critique may not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, even if the failure is not the result of any personal biases of the author.
Thought: 
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician who provided the critique is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  This argument assumes that the physician is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug because of their association with the company.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes for granted that anyone associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  The answer is B.
Criticism: 
  The argument does not address the possibility that the physician's critique may be based on legitimate grounds, such as scientific evidence, regardless of their association with the company.
  Therefore, the argument is also vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  Both B and D are valid criticisms of the argument.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The evolution of the anatomically modern human brain required a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats.
  Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in shore environments.
  The human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Thought: 
  The apparent conflict is that the evolution of the human brain required a high-calorie diet that was most abundant and reliable in shore environments, but the evolution of the human brain took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find an option that explains why the human brain's evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas instead of shore environments.
  Option A is irrelevant to the conflict.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the conflict.
  Option C does not resolve the conflict because it only talks about the reliability and abundance of resources in prehistoric savanna and woodland areas, not shore environments.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the conflict.
  Option E resolves the conflict because it explains that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. Therefore, early humans may have avoided shore environments to conserve energy and instead focused on savanna and woodland areas where food gathering was less energy-intensive.
  The answer is E.
Criticism: 
  The reasoning is sound, and the answer is correct.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The evolution of the anatomically modern human brain required a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats.
- Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in shore environments.
- The human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Thought:
- There is a conflict between the fact that a high-calorie diet with adequate fats was most abundant in shore environments, but the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
- To resolve this conflict, we need to find a statement that explains why early humans did not evolve their brains in shore environments despite the abundance of food resources there.
- Option A is irrelevant to the conflict presented.
- Option B is also irrelevant to the conflict presented.
- Option C does not explain why early humans did not evolve their brains in shore environments despite the abundance of food resources there.
- Option D is irrelevant to the conflict presented.
- Option E provides a possible explanation for the conflict presented. If gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments, then it would make sense that early humans did not evolve their brains in shore environments despite the abundance of food resources there.

- Option E is not a definitive answer to the conflict presented. It only provides a possible explanation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The evolution of the anatomically modern human brain required a high-calorie diet with adequate fats.
- Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in shore environments.
- The human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Thought:
- The conflict is that the high-calorie diet required for the evolution of the human brain was most abundant in shore environments, but the evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Sarah: When commercial fishing boats with permits to fish for certain species accidentally catch a type of fish for which they have no permit, the latter must be thrown back. This is a very wasteful practice because many, if not most, of the rejected fish do not survive. Fishing permits should therefore be altered so that fishers can keep fish caught accidentally. Amar: Making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more "accidents."
Question: The technique Amar uses in responding to Sarah's argument is to
Choices:
  A: question whether Sarah's recommendation can be put into practice
  B: point out that Sarah used a crucial term in two distinct senses
  C: allude to a factor that supposedly strengthens the case for Sarah's recommendation
  D: contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence
  E: maintain that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Carpal tunnel syndrome is a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists.
  Repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard can cause carpal tunnel syndrome.
  A recent study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Thought: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need to find an answer that explains why this is the case.
  A: If office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work, then this would suggest that the amount of typing is a factor in the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, rather than the level of control over one's work.
  B: If feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders, then this would suggest that the level of control over one's work is a factor in the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  C: If the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, then this would suggest that the amount of typing is a factor in the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, rather than the level of control over one's work.
  D: If among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work, then this would suggest that the level of control over one's work is a factor in the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  E: If office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work, then this would suggest that the amount of typing is a factor in the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, rather than the level of control over one's work.
Criticism: 
  All of the answer choices except for B and D suggest that the amount of typing is a factor in the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, rather than the level of control over one's work.
  Answer choice B suggests that the level of control over one's work is a factor in the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, but it does not explain why this is the case.
  Answer choice D suggests that the level of control over one's work is a factor in the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, and it provides evidence to support this claim.

  A recent study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Choices:
  A: This choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work. This does not explain why workers with less control over their work have a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  B: This choice suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This provides a possible explanation for the study's findings, as it suggests that the higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome among workers with less control over their work may be due to the emotional stress they experience.
  C: This choice suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. While this may be a contributing factor to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, it does not explain why workers with less control over their work have a higher risk of developing the condition.
  D: This choice suggests that among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work. This does not provide an explanation for the study's findings, as the study specifically looked at office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  E: This choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This does not explain why workers with less control over their work have a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
Thought: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Choice B provides a possible explanation for the study's findings, as it suggests that the higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome among workers with less control over their work may be due to the emotional stress they experience.

  A: This choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work. This does not explain the study's findings as the study found that among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  B: This choice suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This choice helps to explain the study's findings as it suggests that the emotional stress caused by feeling a lack of control over one's own work makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
  C: This choice suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This choice does not explain the study's findings as it does not address the issue of control over one's own work.
  D: This choice suggests that among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work. This choice does not explain the study's findings as the study focused on office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  E: This choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This choice does not explain the study's findings as the study focused on the effects of control over one's own work on the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome among office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
Thought: 
  The study found that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Choice B suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Therefore, choice B most helps to explain the study's findings.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous, despite the fact that this drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy indicated above?
Choices:
  A: The drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available.
  B: The drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low.
  C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
  D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
  E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that the recent concert was probably not properly promoted because it did not sell out, despite Wells' expectation that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
Thought: 
  Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, expected the concert to sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  The pattern of reasoning is that an expected outcome did not occur, so the reason for the unexpected outcome is probably the opposite of what was expected.
  The argument is most similar to B: Professor Willis expected the sample to contain organic compounds if it were labeled correctly, but it did not contain organic compounds, so the sample is probably not labeled correctly.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant criticism to the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which someone with expertise in a particular area makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and then the opposite outcome occurs. 
  A: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which someone with expertise in a particular area makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and then the opposite outcome occurs.
  B: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which someone with expertise in a particular area makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and then draws a conclusion based on that prediction.
  C: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which someone with expertise in a particular area makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and then draws a conclusion based on the opposite outcome.
  D: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which someone with expertise in a particular area makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and then draws a conclusion based on a different outcome.
  E: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which someone with expertise in a particular area makes a prediction about a certain outcome, and then draws a conclusion based on the same outcome.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which someone with expertise in a particular area (Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business) makes a prediction about a certain outcome (the concert selling out), and then the opposite outcome occurs (the concert does not sell out). The argument then concludes that the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  The pattern of reasoning in option A is similar, as it also presents someone with expertise in a particular area (Dr. Smith, a cardiologist) making a prediction about a certain outcome (the patient surviving the heart transplant), and then the opposite outcome occurs (the patient does not survive). The argument then concludes that the surgery was probably not properly performed.
  The patterns of reasoning in options B, C, D, and E are not similar to the argument presented.
Criticism: 
  The analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:

  The argument is similar to option C.
Criticism:
  There is no flaw in the reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which someone with expertise in a certain area makes a prediction about an event based on certain conditions, and then concludes that the opposite of the prediction is true when the event does not occur.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person predicts an outcome based on certain conditions, and the outcome does not occur, suggesting that the conditions were not met.
A: Dr. Smith predicts a positive outcome based on certain conditions, but the outcome does not occur, suggesting that the conditions were not met.
B: Professor Willis predicts a negative outcome based on certain conditions, and the outcome does occur, suggesting that the conditions were met.
C: The neighbor predicts a positive outcome based on certain conditions, but the outcome does not occur, suggesting that the conditions were not met.
D: The builder predicts a positive outcome based on certain conditions, but the outcome does not occur, suggesting that the conditions were not met.
E: Professor Yanakita predicts a positive outcome based on certain conditions, and the outcome does occur, suggesting that the conditions were met.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a pattern of reasoning in which a knowledgeable person predicts an outcome based on certain conditions, and the outcome does not occur, suggesting that the conditions were not met.
  A is similar to the argument in that Dr. Smith predicts a positive outcome based on certain conditions, but the outcome does not occur, suggesting that the conditions were not met.
  B, C, D, and E are not similar to the argument because they do not follow the same pattern of reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is A.

  Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, believed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
Thought: 
  Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, believed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  This is similar to option C, where the neighbor believed that the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired, but since the damage is still noticeable, the repair was probably not properly done.
  The argument in option C is similar to the argument in the question stem because both arguments rely on an expert's opinion and a predicted outcome that did not occur, leading to the conclusion that something was not done properly.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that the recent concert was probably not properly promoted because it did not sell out.
  Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
Thought: 
  Wells is knowledgeable about the concert business.
  Wells was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, the concert was probably not properly promoted.
  The pattern of reasoning is that if X is true, then Y is likely to be true. Y is not true, so X is probably not true.
  The argument is most similar to option C.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:

Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  A: This criticism suggests that the argument is based on a small sample size and may not be representative of the entire Kodiak bear population.
  B: This criticism suggests that the argument overlooks the possibility that walking on hind legs may be a combination of both innate and learned behavior.
  C: This criticism suggests that the argument uses the term "behavior" inconsistently, which could lead to confusion or misunderstanding.
  D: This criticism suggests that the argument makes an unwarranted assumption that all behavior can be explained by either innate or learned behavior.
  E: This criticism suggests that the argument relies too heavily on the authority of science without providing sufficient evidence to support its claims.
Thought:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  The argument does not make any generalizations about the entire Kodiak bear population, so criticism A is not applicable.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Paleontologists believed that Diplodocus fed on high-growing vegetation by raising its long neck.
  Computer models have shown that Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement.
  Diplodocus's neck could bend downward and extend below ground level, allowing it to access underwater vegetation from dry land.
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The argument is based on the premise that Diplodocus's neck structure would have prevented it from raising its neck to feed on high-growing vegetation.
  Therefore, an assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  Choice D states this assumption.

  E: The argument concludes that since anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it, and my next-door neighbors do not own their house, then it must be that they pay rent on it.
Thought: 
  The argument above concludes that since no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise, and Lester has not received a raise, then it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation.
  This is flawed reasoning because it assumes that receiving a poor performance evaluation is the only reason someone would not receive a raise.
  A is not similar to the argument above.
  B is similar to the argument above because it assumes that owning a house and paying rent on a house are mutually exclusive, just as the argument above assumes that receiving a poor performance evaluation and a raise are mutually exclusive.
  C is not similar to the argument above.
  D is similar to the argument above because it assumes that owning a house and paying rent on a house are mutually exclusive, just as the argument above assumes that receiving a poor performance evaluation and a raise are mutually exclusive.
  E is not similar to the argument above.
  The argument above is most similar to B and D.
Criticism: 
  The criticism of the argument above is that it assumes that receiving a poor performance evaluation is the only reason someone would not receive a raise, which may not be true.
  The criticism of B is that it assumes that owning a house and paying rent on a house are mutually exclusive, which may not be true.

Thought:
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument assumes that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  This is flawed reasoning because it assumes that there are only two possible outcomes: either a poor performance evaluation or a raise.

  D: The argument concludes that since no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, and my next-door neighbors do not own their house, then they must pay rent on it.
  E: The argument concludes that since anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it, and my next-door neighbors do not own their house, then they must pay rent on it.
Thought: 
  The argument above concludes that since no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise, and Lester has not received a raise, then he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  This argument assumes that the only reason someone would not receive a raise is because they received a poor performance evaluation.
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why someone did not receive a raise.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in answer choice E.
Criticism: 
  Your evaluation of the argument is correct.
  However, the reasoning in answer choice E is not the most similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
  Answer choice A is actually the most similar because it assumes that the only reason someone would pay rent on a house is because they do not own it, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise.
  The argument assumes that receiving a raise and receiving a poor performance evaluation are mutually exclusive.
Thought:
  No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  Lester has not received a raise.
  Therefore, Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument assumes that receiving a raise and receiving a poor performance evaluation are mutually exclusive.
  This is flawed reasoning because it is possible for someone to not receive a raise for reasons other than a poor performance evaluation.
  For example, the company may not have the budget for raises or may have a policy of not giving raises during a certain time period.
  This flawed reasoning is most similar to the reasoning in option B.
  Option B assumes that owning a house and paying rent on a house are mutually exclusive, which is not necessarily true.
Criticism: 
  The analysis of the flawed reasoning is correct.
  However, the explanation for why option B is flawed is not accurate.
  Option B assumes that owning a house and paying rent on a house are mutually exclusive, which is not necessarily true.
  This is similar to the flawed assumption in the original argument that receiving a raise and receiving a poor performance evaluation are mutually exclusive.

  This is flawed reasoning because it assumes that there are only two possible outcomes: either an employee receives a raise or a poor performance evaluation. It does not consider the possibility that an employee may receive neither a raise nor a poor performance evaluation.
  This flawed reasoning is most similar to the reasoning in option B.
  Option B concludes that since the neighbors own their house, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  The argument assumes that no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it.
  This is flawed reasoning because it assumes that there are only two possible outcomes: either a person owns a house or pays rent on it. It does not consider the possibility that a person may both own a house and pay rent on it.
Criticism: 
  There are no flaws in the thought process.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  A: The argument involves a negative correlation between two events.
  B: The argument involves a positive correlation between two events.
  C: The argument involves a positive correlation between two events.
  D: The argument involves a negative correlation between two events.
  E: The argument involves a positive correlation between two events.
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that since no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise, and Lester has not received a raise, then he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  This argument assumes that the only reason for not receiving a raise is a poor performance evaluation.
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument is most similar to the reasoning in option E.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise.
  The argument assumes that receiving a poor performance evaluation is the only reason someone would not receive a raise.
Thought:
  The argument assumes that there is only one reason why someone would not receive a raise.
  It is possible that there are other reasons why someone would not receive a raise.
  Therefore, the argument's conclusion is flawed.
  The flawed reasoning in the argument is most similar to the reasoning in option B.
  Option B assumes that there is only one reason why someone would not pay rent on a house.
  It is possible that there are other reasons why someone would not pay rent on a house.
  Therefore, the argument's conclusion is flawed.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is based on the premise that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. 
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that the only reason Lester has not received a raise is because he received a poor performance evaluation. 
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise, such as budget constraints or a company-wide policy. 
  This flawed reasoning is most similar to the reasoning in option E.
  Option E assumes that anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. 
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why someone does not own a house, such as choosing to rent or not being able to afford to buy a house.
Criticism: 
  The reasoning in option E is not exactly the same as the reasoning in the original argument. 
  Option E assumes that anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it, while the original argument assumes that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. 
  However, both arguments make unwarranted assumptions and draw conclusions based on those assumptions.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  A: The argument involves a conditional statement with two conditions that cannot both be true at the same time. The conclusion is drawn based on one of the conditions being true.
  B: The argument involves a conditional statement with two conditions that cannot both be true at the same time. The conclusion is drawn based on one of the conditions being true.
  C: The argument involves a conditional statement with one condition. The conclusion is drawn based on the condition being true.
  D: The argument involves a conditional statement with two conditions that cannot both be true at the same time. The conclusion is drawn based on one of the conditions being true.
  E: The argument involves a conditional statement with two conditions that cannot both be true at the same time. The conclusion is drawn based on one of the conditions being true.
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument assumes that there are only two possible outcomes: either Lester received a raise or he received a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument assumes that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  The flawed reasoning in the argument is most similar to the reasoning in option B, which also involves a conditional statement with two conditions that cannot both be true at the same time.
Criticism: 
  The argument assumes that there are only two possible outcomes: either Lester received a raise or he received a poor performance evaluation. However, there could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise, such as budget constraints or company policies.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise.
  The argument assumes that receiving a raise and receiving a poor performance evaluation are mutually exclusive.
Thought:
  The argument assumes that receiving a raise and receiving a poor performance evaluation are mutually exclusive.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why Lester has not received a raise.
  For example, the company may not have the budget to give raises this year.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument is most similar to the reasoning in answer choice B.
Criticism:
  The reasoning in answer choice B is not flawed.
  The argument in answer choice B concludes that the neighbors do not pay rent on their house because they own it.
  This is a valid conclusion because owning a house and paying rent on it are mutually exclusive.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument is not most similar to the reasoning in any of the answer choices.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Thought: 
  Option A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
    This argument assumes that Sandy did not believe the offer to be made in jest. The principle stated in the context supports this assumption. Therefore, this argument is justified.
  Option B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
    This argument is supported by the principle stated in the context. Therefore, this argument is justified.
  Option C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
    This argument assumes that Mindy did not believe the offer to be made in jest. The principle stated in the context supports this assumption. However, this argument is flawed because it assumes that Mindy will accept the offer if it is legitimate, which may not be the case.
  Option D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
    This argument is supported by the principle stated in the context. Therefore, this argument is justified.
  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
    This argument assumes that the offer was not legitimate. The principle stated in the context supports this assumption. Therefore, this argument is justified.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.

  Option D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. - This argument is consistent with the principle stated above.
  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. - This argument does not address the issue of whether the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option B and D are consistent with the principle stated above, but option D is a stronger argument because it explicitly states that the offer was not made in jest.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this analysis.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Thought: 
  Option A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
    This argument is valid because Joe made a legitimate offer and Sandy did not reject it, so there was a valid contract.
  Option B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
    This argument is valid because Gus's offer was not legitimate since he made it in jest, so the contract was not valid.
  Option C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
    This argument is not valid because the fact that Frank's offer was legitimate does not necessarily mean that Mindy will accept it.
  Option D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
    This argument is valid because Hai's offer was legitimate since no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, so if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
    This argument is valid because Sal's offer was not legitimate, so there is no valid contract between them.
Criticism: 
  The principle stated in the question is valid and the arguments in options A, B, D, and E are logically sound. 
  However, the argument in option C is not valid because the fact that an offer is legitimate does not necessarily mean that the other party will accept it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Thought: 
  The principle stated above helps to justify the reasoning in option B.
  Option B states that Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus made the offer in jest.
  According to the principle, an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Therefore, the contract was not valid.
  This reasoning is justified by the principle stated above.
  The other options do not involve the issue of whether an offer is legitimate or not.
  Therefore, they are not justified by the principle stated above.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Thought: 
  Option A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
    This argument is valid based on the principle stated above. If Joe made a legitimate offer and Sandy did not reject it, then there is a valid contract.
  Option B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
    This argument is also valid based on the principle stated above. If Gus made the offer in jest and Kenta did not know that, then the offer was not legitimate and there is no valid contract.
  Option C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
    This argument is not valid based on the principle stated above. Just because Frank's offer was legitimate does not mean that Mindy is required to accept it. She may have other reasons for not accepting the offer.
  Option D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
    This argument is also valid based on the principle stated above. If Hai's offer was made in a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, then the offer was legitimate and there is a valid contract if Lea accepts it.
  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
    This argument is also valid based on the principle stated above. If Sal's offer was not legitimate, then there is no valid contract between them.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to the application of the principle to options A, B, D, and E.
  Option C is not valid because it assumes that Mindy is required to accept Frank's offer just because it was legitimate.
Action: Answer("B")

    This argument is supported by the principle stated above.
  Option C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
    This argument assumes that Mindy did not believe the offer was made in jest. The principle stated above does not support this argument.
  Option D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
    This argument is supported by the principle stated above.
  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
    This argument assumes that the offer was not legitimate. The principle stated above does not support this argument.
Criticism: 
  Options A, B, and D are all supported by the principle stated above.

  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Thought: 
  Option A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
    This argument assumes that Joe's offer was legitimate and that Sandy did not believe the offer to be made in jest.
    The principle stated in the context supports this argument.
  Option B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
    This argument assumes that Gus's offer was not legitimate because he made it in jest.
    The principle stated in the context supports this argument.
  Option C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
    This argument assumes that Frank's offer was legitimate and that Mindy is a reasonable person.
    The principle stated in the context does not directly support this argument.
  Option D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
    This argument assumes that Hai's offer was legitimate because no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest.
    The principle stated in the context supports this argument.
  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
    This argument assumes that Sal's offer was not legitimate.
    The principle stated in the context supports this argument.
Criticism: 
  Options A, B, D, and E are all plausible arguments that could be supported by the principle stated in the context.
  Option C, however, assumes that Mindy is a reasonable person, which is not necessarily supported by the principle stated in the context.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Thought: 
  Option A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
    This argument assumes that Sandy did not believe the offer was made in jest. The principle stated above supports this assumption, as it states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest. Therefore, this argument is justified by the principle.
  Option B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
    This argument is also supported by the principle stated above. If someone in Kenta's position would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest, then the offer is not legitimate and there is no valid contract.
  Option C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
    This argument does not relate to the principle stated above. It assumes that Frank's offer is legitimate and that Mindy is a reasonable person, but it does not address whether someone in Mindy's position would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
    This argument is also supported by the principle stated above. If no one in Lea's position would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest, then the offer is legitimate and there is a valid contract.
  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
    This argument assumes that the offer was not legitimate, but it does not address whether someone in Veronica's position would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the reasoning used to evaluate the options.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Thought: 
  The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A: This argument is valid because it states that Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  Option B: This argument is valid because it states that Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  Option C: This argument is not valid because it states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. However, the principle does not state that an offer is legitimate if the person to whom it was made is reasonable.
  Option D: This argument is valid because it states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  Option E: This argument is not valid because it states that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. However, the principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Thought:
  Option A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
    This argument assumes that Joe's offer was legitimate and that Sandy did not believe the offer to be made in jest. The principle stated above supports the idea that Sandy must have believed the offer to be legitimate for there to be a valid contract. This argument is not justified by the principle.
  Option B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
    This argument is supported by the principle stated above. If Kenta believed that Gus's offer was legitimate, but Gus made the offer in jest, then the offer was not legitimate and there was no valid contract.
  Option C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
    This argument assumes that Frank's offer was legitimate and that Mindy is a reasonable person. The principle stated above supports the idea that the offer must be legitimate, but it does not necessarily support the idea that Mindy must accept the offer if it is legitimate. This argument is not justified by the principle.
  Option D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
    This argument is supported by the principle stated above. If no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed the offer to be made in jest, then the offer is legitimate and there would be a valid contract if Lea accepts the offer.
  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
    This argument assumes that Sal's offer was not legitimate. The principle stated above supports the idea that the offer must be legitimate for there to be a valid contract. This argument is justified by the principle.
Criticism:
  The principle stated above is concerned with the legitimacy of an offer, not the acceptance of an offer. Options A and C assume that the acceptance of a legitimate offer creates a valid contract, but this is not necessarily true. The principle only addresses the legitimacy of the offer itself.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

- The passage states that horror stories about mad scientists express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, but it does not say that most stories express this view, so D is not necessarily true.
- The passage states that horror stories may employ symbolism to describe violations of the laws of nature, so E is true.

Criticism:
- There are no flaws in the logic or reasoning used to arrive at the answer.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast.
- In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
- Horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
- Both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.

Thought:
- The statements do not suggest that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature, so A is not necessarily true.
- The statements do not suggest that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader, so B is not necessarily true.
- The statements suggest that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, but not that this is true of horror stories of any kind, so C is not necessarily true.
- The statements suggest that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, but not that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views, so D is not necessarily true.
- The statements suggest that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature, so E could be true.

Criticism:
- The statements do not provide enough information to determine whether E is true or not.

Action: Answer("None of the above")

- Horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
- Both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.

Thought:
- The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader.
- None of the statements in the answer choices are explicitly stated in the passage.
- Statement A is too extreme, as it uses the word "all" and is not supported by the passage.
- Statement B is also too extreme, as it uses the word "any" and is not supported by the passage.
- Statement C is not supported by the passage, as it only mentions that some horror stories about monstrous beasts use symbolism to represent psychological disturbance.
- Statement D is not entirely accurate, as the passage only states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
- Statement E is possible, as the passage mentions that some horror stories about monstrous beasts use symbolism to represent psychological disturbance, and that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature.

Criticism:
- Statement E is possible, but it is not necessarily true. The passage only mentions that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature, not all of them.

Action: Answer("E")

- Horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
- Both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.

Thought:
- Option A is not necessarily true because not all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature. For example, a story about a giant friendly dog would not describe a violation of the laws of nature.
- Option B is not necessarily true because not all stories that describe a violation of a law of nature are intended to invoke dread in the reader. For example, a story about a scientist who discovers a new law of nature could describe a violation of the old law, but not be intended to invoke dread.
- Option C is not necessarily true because not all horror stories describe characters who are psychologically disturbed. For example, a horror story about a haunted house may not have any psychologically disturbed characters.
- Option D is not necessarily true because not all stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views. For example, a story about a mad scientist who creates a cure for a deadly disease could express the author's belief in the power of science.
- Option E is possible because some stories that employ symbolism could describe violations of the laws of nature. For example, a story about a tree that grows too tall and disrupts the balance of nature could be a symbolic violation of the laws of nature.

Criticism:
- Option E is possible, but it is not necessarily true. It depends on the specific story and how the symbolism is used.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is based on the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that indicates that stretching before jogging could have some effect on preventing injuries.
  Option E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
  This suggests that stretching could have some effect on preventing injuries.
  Therefore, option E weakens the medical researcher's argument the most.

  Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  Therefore, the researcher concluded that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that contradicts the researcher's conclusion.
  A: This option does not weaken the argument because it supports the conclusion that stretching does not help to prevent injuries.
  B: This option weakens the argument because it suggests that the group of joggers who stretch before jogging may have incurred more injuries if they had not experienced difficulty in performing stretches.
  C: This option does not weaken the argument because it suggests that stretching would have little if any effect on preventing injuries.
  D: This option does not weaken the argument because it does not contradict the researcher's conclusion.
  E: This option does not weaken the argument because it refers to "certain forms of exercise," not jogging.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the comparison of two groups of joggers, one that stretches before jogging and one that does not.
  The argument assumes that the two groups are similar in all other respects.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a reason why the two groups might not be comparable.
  Choice B suggests that some joggers in the stretching group might have had difficulty performing stretches because of previous injuries.
  This could mean that the stretching group was not stretching as effectively as they could have been, which could explain why stretching did not prevent injuries.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")

Thought: 
  The argument is based on the comparison of two groups of joggers, one that stretches before jogging and one that does not.
  If there is a flaw in the comparison, it could weaken the argument.
  A: This statement does not weaken the argument. It suggests that both groups of joggers had a lower rate of injuries than the overall rate of jogging injuries, which is a positive outcome.
  B: This statement suggests that some joggers may have difficulty performing stretches, but it does not necessarily weaken the argument that stretching does not help prevent injuries.
  C: This statement suggests that most jogging injuries are not related to flexibility, which could weaken the argument that stretching helps prevent injuries.
  D: This statement suggests that joggers who are more prone to injuries are more likely to stretch, which could weaken the argument that stretching does not help prevent injuries.
  E: This statement suggests that stretching can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise, but it does not necessarily weaken the argument that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries.
Criticism: 
  Statement C and D could weaken the argument.

  Therefore, the researcher concludes that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the conclusion.
  A: This statement does not weaken the argument because it does not address the issue of stretching before jogging.
  B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the group of joggers who stretched before jogging may have been injured more frequently because they experienced difficulty in performing stretches.
  C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that most jogging injuries are not preventable by stretching.
  D: This statement does not weaken the argument because it does not address the issue of stretching before jogging.
  E: This statement does not weaken the argument because it does not address the issue of jogging injuries.
Criticism: 
  The argument is based on a comparison of two groups of joggers, one that stretches before jogging and one that does not.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.

Thought: 
  The argument above makes a flawed pattern of reasoning by assuming that the majority of one group implies the majority of another group.
  A: The argument above is similar to this option because it assumes that the majority of paintings on display implies the majority of paintings owned by the museum.
  B: This option is not similar to the argument above because it does not assume that the majority of one group implies the majority of another group.
  C: This option is not similar to the argument above because it does not assume that the majority of one group implies the majority of another group.
  D: This option is not similar to the argument above because it does not assume that the majority of one group implies the majority of another group.

Thought: 
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class, but most of the psychology majors are not.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that the number of students enrolled in the class is proportional to the number of majors in each discipline.
  Therefore, the argument is most similar to that in option B, which assumes that the number of residents in favor of spending more on roads is proportional to the number of residents opposed to spending more on parks.
  Both arguments make unwarranted assumptions about the relationship between two variables.
  Option A is different because it assumes that the paintings on display at the museum are representative of the paintings the museum owns, which may not be true.
  Option C is different because it makes a conclusion about the San Felipe area based on the composition of the trees in the city arboretum, which may not be representative of the area as a whole.
  Option D is different because it makes a conclusion about the availability of organic vegetables at two stores based on the proportion of organic vegetables available at each store, which may not be representative of the total number of vegetables available at each store.
  Option E is different because it makes a conclusion about the number of houses and condominiums for sale based on the number of photos of each type of property on the Acme Realty website, which may not be representative of the total number of each type of property for sale.

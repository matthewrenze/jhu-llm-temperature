### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.

  E: This choice suggests that the advertisement is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the other five colas tasted.
  However, the study was carefully controlled, and the advertisement does not provide any information about the methodology of the study.
  The advertisement also does not provide any information about the sample size or the characteristics of the volunteers.
  Therefore, it is possible that the results of the study are not generalizable to the population at large.
  Choice A is a valid criticism because the study may not have been representative of the entire population.
  Choice B is not a valid criticism because the advertisement does not make any claims about the likelihood of volunteers buying Sparkle Cola.
  Choice C is a valid criticism because the study did not test all possible colas.
  Choice D is a valid criticism because the study did not control for factors such as packaging and price.
  Choice E is not a valid criticism because the study was focused on colas, not other beverages.
  The most vulnerable criticism is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:

Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that in a controlled study, blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to five competing colas.
  A: This option suggests that the generalization made about the entire group may not be true for each of the five smaller groups.
  B: This option suggests that the advertisement assumes that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola over the other colas tasted.
  C: This option suggests that the study overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: This option suggests that the study overlooks the possibility that people may prefer Sparkle Cola for reasons other than taste.
  E: This option suggests that the study only elicits responses to colas and not other beverages.
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to five competing colas.
  However, the study may not be representative of the entire population.
  The advertisement assumes that the preference for Sparkle Cola is based on taste alone.
  The study does not consider other factors that may influence a person's preference for Sparkle Cola.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds of option D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.

  Therefore, choice C is the most vulnerable criticism of the advertisement.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  A: The advertisement divides the volunteers into five groups, each tasting a different cola.
  B: The advertisement assumes that the preference for Sparkle Cola will translate into purchasing behavior.
  C: The advertisement does not consider the possibility that other colas not tested may elicit a more favorable response.
  D: The advertisement does not consider factors other than taste that may influence a consumer's preference for Sparkle Cola.
  E: The advertisement only tests colas and does not consider other types of beverages.
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  However, the study only tested five colas, and it is possible that other colas not tested may elicit a more favorable response.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  The answer is C.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is sound. The study only tested five colas, and it is possible that other colas not tested may elicit a more favorable response. However, it is also possible that the five colas tested are representative of the most popular colas on the market. Therefore, it is not necessarily a flaw in the reasoning to limit the study to these five colas.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The advertisement claims that blindfolded volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to five competing colas.
  A: This option suggests that the generalization made about the entire group may not be true for each of the smaller groups.

  C: This option suggests that the study may not have tested all possible colas, and therefore, the results may not be accurate.
  D: This option suggests that the study may not have controlled for other factors that could influence consumer preferences.
  E: This option suggests that the study may not be comprehensive enough to make a definitive conclusion about consumer preferences.
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  Option A suggests that the study may not be generalizable to the entire population, but the advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested, not the entire population.
  Option B suggests that the study may not be applicable to real-world situations, but the advertisement does not make any claims about the real-world situations.
  Option C suggests that the study may not have tested all possible colas, but the advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  Option D suggests that the study may not have controlled for other factors that could influence consumer preferences, which is a valid criticism of the study.
  Option E suggests that the study may not be comprehensive enough to make a definitive conclusion about consumer preferences, which is a valid criticism of the study.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
Criticism: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested, but the study may not have controlled for other factors that could influence consumer preferences, such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.

  D: The argument involves a conditional statement and a conditional chain, and the conclusion follows logically from the premises.
  E: The argument involves a conditional statement and a conditional chain, but it is not similar to the argument above.
Thought: 
  The argument above is based on a conditional statement and a conditional chain.
  The conclusion follows logically from the premises.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  Therefore, the argument is most similar to D, which is also based on a conditional statement and a conditional chain, and the conclusion follows logically from the premises.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is based on the conditional statement "If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds" and the premise "squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover."
  A: The argument is based on a conditional statement and a premise, but the conclusion is not related to either of them.
  B: The argument is based on a conditional statement and a premise, and the conclusion follows logically from them.
  C: The argument is not based on a conditional statement, and the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise.
  D: The argument is based on a conditional statement and a premise, and the conclusion follows logically from them.
  E: The argument is based on a conditional statement and a premise, but the conclusion is not related to either of them.
Thought: 
  The argument above is based on a conditional statement and a premise, and the conclusion follows logically from them.
  The pattern of reasoning is that if a certain condition is met, then a certain result will follow.
  The argument assumes that the condition is necessary for the result to occur.
  The argument also assumes that if the condition is not met, then the result will not occur.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is similar to that in answer choice A.
  Answer choice A is based on a conditional statement and a premise, but the conclusion is not related to either of them.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the argument above is based on a conditional statement and a premise, and the conclusion follows logically from them.
  However, the argument assumes that the condition is both necessary and sufficient for the result to occur, which may not be true in all cases.
  Also, answer choice A is not similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above, as the conclusion is not related to the conditional statement and the premise.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is based on a conditional statement.
  A: The argument is based on a conditional statement, but the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
  B: The argument is based on a conditional statement, and the conclusion follows logically from the premises.
  C: The argument is not based on a conditional statement.
  D: The argument is based on a conditional statement, and the conclusion follows logically from the premises.
  E: The argument is based on a conditional statement, but the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Thought: 
  The argument above is based on a conditional statement.
  The conclusion follows logically from the premises if the conditional statement is true.
  A, C, and E are flawed because the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
  B and D are similar in that they are based on a conditional statement, and the conclusion follows logically from the premises.
  However, D is flawed because it uses circular reasoning.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above uses a conditional statement to argue that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  A: The argument involves a conditional statement, but it is not similar to the argument above because it concludes that checking the tire pressure regularly will prevent premature tire wear.
  B: The argument involves a conditional statement and concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, but it is not similar to the argument above because it does not involve a protective cover.
  C: The argument involves a conditional statement and concludes that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure, but it is not similar to the argument above because it does not involve a protective cover.
  D: The argument involves a conditional statement and concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, but it is not similar to the argument above because it does not involve a protective cover.
  E: The argument involves a conditional statement and concludes that keeping tire pressure from becoming too low will not help a tire last longer if it is often driven on gravel roads, but it is not similar to the argument above because it involves an additional condition about driving on gravel roads.
Thought: 
  The argument above uses a conditional statement to argue that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  However, the argument assumes that the only reason squirrels eat from a bird feeder is because it lacks a protective cover.
  This assumption may not be true, as squirrels may also eat from bird feeders for other reasons.
  Therefore, the argument's pattern of reasoning is flawed.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning is most similar to that in answer choice D, which assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis of the argument above is correct.
  However, the argument in answer choice D is not flawed in the same way as the argument above.
  The argument in answer choice D assumes that neglecting to check the tire pressure regularly is the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely, which may not be true.
  However, this assumption is not as problematic as the assumption in the argument above, which assumes that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  Therefore, the answer choice that is most similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above uses a conditional statement to draw a conclusion.
  A: The argument uses a conditional statement to draw a conclusion, but the conclusion is valid.
  B: The argument uses a conditional statement to draw a conclusion, but the conclusion is valid.
  C: The argument does not use a conditional statement to draw a conclusion.
  D: The argument uses a conditional statement to draw a conclusion, but the conclusion is valid.
  E: The argument uses a conditional statement to draw a conclusion, but the conclusion is not valid.
Thought: 
  The argument above uses a conditional statement to draw a conclusion.
  The conclusion is not valid because it assumes that the only reason squirrels eat from a bird feeder is that it lacks a protective cover.
  A is not similar because the conclusion is valid.
  B is not similar because the conclusion is valid.
  C is not similar because it does not use a conditional statement to draw a conclusion.
  D is similar because it uses a conditional statement to draw a conclusion, but the conclusion is not valid.
  E is not similar because the conclusion is not valid due to the additional premise.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above presents a conditional statement: if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, squirrels will eat from it, and if squirrels eat from it, it will not attract many birds.
  A: The argument presents a conditional statement: if a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. The conclusion is that if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: The argument presents a conditional statement: if a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. The conclusion is that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: The argument presents a conditional statement: tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. The conclusion is that car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: The argument presents a conditional statement: if a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. The conclusion is that if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: The argument presents a conditional statement: if a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. The conclusion is that if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Thought: 
  The argument above presents a conditional statement: if a bird feeder lacks a protective cover, squirrels will eat from it, and if squirrels eat from it, it will not attract many birds.
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is because squirrels eat from it.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is a conditional statement.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is because of squirrels.
  A: The argument is not similar to this because it is a valid conditional statement.
  B: The argument is similar to this because it assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure.
  C: The argument is not similar to this because it is about making car owners aware of the consequences of neglecting to check tire pressure.
  D: The argument is similar to this because it assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure and neglecting to check tire pressure.
  E: The argument is not similar to this because it introduces another reason why a tire may wear out prematurely.
Thought: 
  The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is because of squirrels.
  Choice B is similar because it assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure.
  Therefore, the answer is B.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the argument above is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is because of squirrels.
  However, choice B is not similar because it does not assume that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure. It also mentions neglecting to check tire pressure.
  The argument in choice D is more similar because it assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure and neglecting to check tire pressure.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is based on a conditional statement and a conditional chain.
  A: The argument involves a conditional statement and a conditional chain, but the flawed pattern of reasoning is not the same as in the argument above.
  B: The argument involves a conditional statement and a conditional chain, but the flawed pattern of reasoning is not the same as in the argument above.
  C: The argument does not involve a conditional statement or a conditional chain, so the flawed pattern of reasoning is not the same as in the argument above.
  D: The argument involves a conditional statement and a conditional chain, and the flawed pattern of reasoning is similar to the argument above.
  E: The argument involves a conditional statement and a conditional chain, but the flawed pattern of reasoning is not the same as in the argument above.

  The argument above is based on a conditional statement and a conditional chain.
  The conclusion is based on the conditional chain, which is flawed.
  Option D also involves a conditional statement and a conditional chain.
  The conclusion is based on the conditional chain, which is also flawed.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in option D.
  The answer is D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct. Well done!
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above is based on a conditional statement and a conditional chain.
  A: The argument is based on a conditional statement and a conditional chain, but the reasoning is not flawed.
  B: The argument is based on a conditional statement and a conditional chain, but the reasoning is not flawed.
  C: The argument is based on a conditional statement and a conditional chain, but the reasoning is not flawed.
  D: The argument is based on a conditional statement and a conditional chain, and the reasoning is flawed.
  E: The argument is based on a conditional statement and a conditional chain, but the reasoning is not flawed.
Thought: 
  The argument above is based on a conditional statement and a conditional chain.
  The reasoning is that if squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds.
  Squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  Therefore, a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
  The reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is because of squirrels.
  The argument in D is similar because it also assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is because of low tire pressure.
  The argument in A is not flawed because it is a valid argument.
  The argument in B is not flawed because it is a valid argument.
  The argument in C is not flawed because it is a valid argument.
  The argument in E is not flawed because it is a valid argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument above uses a conditional statement: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds.
  The argument also uses a conditional statement: Squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The argument concludes: So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Thought: 
  The argument above uses a flawed pattern of reasoning called affirming the consequent.
  The argument assumes that if the consequent (squirrels eat from a bird feeder) is true, then the antecedent (the bird feeder lacks a protective cover) must also be true.
  This is a logical fallacy because there could be other reasons why squirrels are eating from the bird feeder.
  Answer choice B has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning. It assumes that if the tire wears out prematurely, then it must be because the car owner neglected to check the tire pressure regularly.
  This is a logical fallacy because there could be other reasons why the tire wore out prematurely.
  Therefore, the answer is B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. Both arguments use the same flawed pattern of reasoning called affirming the consequent.
  However, it is important to note that the other answer choices do not use this same flawed pattern of reasoning.
  Therefore, your answer is the best choice.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.

  The argument is that watching television causes people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters. 
  However, the argument does not consider the possibility that people who are more anxious or fearful are more likely to watch more television and also more likely to overestimate the risks of natural disasters. 
  Therefore, the argument may be flawed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think they will be victims of a natural disaster than those who do not.
Thought:
  The argument assumes that watching television is the only factor that influences people's perception of the risk of natural disasters.
  To weaken the argument, we need to provide an alternative explanation for why people who watch more television are more likely to think they will be victims of natural disasters.
  A: This statement does not provide an alternative explanation for why people who watch more television are more likely to think they will be victims of natural disasters.
  B: This statement suggests that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas that are prone to natural disasters, which weakens the argument that watching television causes people to overestimate the risk of natural disasters.
  C: This statement suggests that people who watch less television have a more accurate perception of the risk of natural disasters, which weakens the argument that watching television causes people to overestimate the risk of natural disasters.
  D: This statement suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to become informed in ways other than by watching television, which weakens the argument that watching television causes people to overestimate the risk of natural disasters.
  E: This statement suggests that people who live in areas that are prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch more television, which weakens the argument that watching television causes people to overestimate the risk of natural disasters.
Criticism: 
  All of the answer choices except for A provide alternative explanations for why people who watch more television are more likely to think they will be victims of natural disasters.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A because it does not weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:

  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  A: This statement does not address the impact of television on people's perception of risk.
  B: This statement contradicts the argument by suggesting that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters.
  C: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that people who watch less television have a more accurate perception of risk.
  D: This statement suggests that there are other ways to become well-informed about natural disasters besides watching television.
  E: This statement does not address the impact of television on people's perception of risk.
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that watching television leads people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.
  If people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, then the argument is weakened.
  Therefore, B weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than those who do not.
Thought:
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that contradicts the argument or shows that the argument is not valid.
  A: This option does not address the argument.
  B: This option contradicts the argument. If a person watches an above-average amount of television, they are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters. Therefore, the argument is not valid.
  C: This option supports the argument. It states that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. Therefore, the argument is valid.
  D: This option supports the argument. It states that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. Therefore, the argument is valid.
  E: This option does not address the argument.
Criticism: 
  Option B contradicts the argument, but it does not necessarily weaken the argument. It provides an alternative explanation for the correlation between television watching and overestimating the risks of natural disasters.
  Option C and D support the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than those who do not.
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that watching television is the only factor that influences people's perception of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
  If there is another factor that influences people's perception of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster, then the argument is weakened.
  Choice A does not weaken the argument because it does not address the relationship between watching television and people's perception of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
  Choice B does not weaken the argument because it suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters, which does not address the relationship between watching television and people's perception of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
  Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster, which suggests that watching television is a factor that influences people's perception of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
  Choice D weakens the argument because it suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, which suggests that watching television is not the only factor that influences people's perception of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
  Choice E does not weaken the argument because it suggests that people who live in an area that is prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch an above-average amount of television, which does not address the relationship between watching television and people's perception of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
Criticism: 
  The argument assumes that people's perception of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster is solely influenced by watching television.
  However, there may be other factors that influence people's perception of the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster.
  For example, people who have experienced a natural disaster may be more likely to perceive the likelihood of being a victim of a natural disaster as higher than those who have not, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  The sample size of the study was very small, only six individual chameleons.
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument defends the study's conclusion by pointing out that the author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  However, this does not address the criticism that the sample size of the study was very small.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole, which is not necessarily true given the small sample size.
  The answer is A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is sound and correctly identifies the vulnerability of the biologist's argument.
  However, it is worth noting that the argument could also be criticized for failing to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.
  Nevertheless, A is a more direct and specific criticism of the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist concludes that chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  Critics of the study doubt its results because of the small sample size.
  The biologist defends the study by pointing out the author's professional reputation.
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that the study's results are valid despite the small sample size because the author is a reputable professional.
  This argument is vulnerable to criticism because the author's reputation does not guarantee the validity of the study's results.
  The argument does not address the specific criticisms of the study's small sample size.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  The answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  However, it is possible that the argument is also vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole, as the study only looked at chameleons and not other lizards.
  Therefore, the answer could also be A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  Critics of the study observed that the sample size was very small.
  The study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that the study's results should not be doubted because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  However, this argument is not relevant to the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  The answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  However, it is possible that the argument could also be criticized for taking the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole (A) or for failing to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun (B).
  Nevertheless, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist conducted a study on the behavior of six individual chameleons.
  The study concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  Critics of the study observed that the sample size was very small.
  The study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that the study's results should not be doubted because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  However, this argument is not a valid defense against the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the criticism that the sample size was very small.
  None of the answer choices directly address this criticism, but A comes closest by suggesting that the argument takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole, which is a related but different issue.
Criticism: 
  The argument is not vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole, because the study only concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  Answer choice C is incorrect because the argument does not focus its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself; it merely mentions the author's credentials as a defense against the criticism of the small sample size.
  Answer choice D is incorrect because the argument does not fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise; it merely mentions the criticism without addressing it directly.
  Answer choice E is incorrect because the argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics; it merely mentions the author's credentials as a defense against the criticism of the small sample size.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist's study concluded that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  Critics of the study observed that the sample size was small.
  The biologist argues that the study's author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that the study's results are valid despite the small sample size because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  However, the validity of the study's results is not necessarily related to the author's professional reputation or past work.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.

Thought: 
  The biologist's argument defends the study's results by pointing out that the author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This is an ad hominem argument that focuses on the author rather than the study itself.
  The argument does not address the criticism that the sample size is too small to support the conclusion that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their production of vitamin D.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  The answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.

  The biologist argues that the study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that the study's author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years, so the study's results should be trusted despite the small sample size.
  However, this argument is flawed because the study's author's professional reputation does not necessarily guarantee the accuracy of the study's results.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
  The answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Criticism: 
  The argument could also be criticized for assuming that the behavior of chameleons is generalizable to lizards as a whole, which is not necessarily true.
  However, this criticism is not as strong as the criticism that the argument focuses on the study's author rather than on the study itself.

  The study's sample size was small.
  The study's author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that the study's results should not be doubted because the author is well-regarded and has been doing excellent work for years.
  This argument is vulnerable to criticism because it is an appeal to authority and does not address the actual criticisms of the study.
  The argument does not provide any evidence that the study's results are valid or that the criticisms are invalid.
  Therefore, the answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the biologist's argument is an appeal to authority and does not address the actual criticisms of the study.
  However, the argument does not take the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole, fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun, fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise, or hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
  Therefore, the answer is C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals suggests that publishing a scholarly journal is now much more profitable than it was several years ago.
  A: Many university libraries charging higher fines for overdue books and periodicals does not necessarily weaken the argument.
  B: The fact that a university library's acquisition budget represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget is irrelevant to the argument.
  C: The fact that publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise and publishers cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money supports the argument.
  D: The fact that most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years weakens the argument.
  E: The fact that the majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year is irrelevant to the argument.
Thought: 
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals suggests that publishing a scholarly journal is now much more profitable than it was several years ago.
  If most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years, then the increase in subscription rates for libraries may not necessarily indicate that publishing a scholarly journal is now much more profitable than it was several years ago.
  Therefore, D weakens the argument.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The regional hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument is that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find a statement that supports the idea that the plan caused the decrease in patient injuries.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be due to the implementation of the plan.
  C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan may not have been comprehensive enough to capture all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  D: This statement supports the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff becoming more meticulous as a result of the knowledge that their errors were being recorded and analyzed.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:

  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer that supports the idea that the plan caused the decrease in patient injuries.
  A: This answer is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This answer weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is not due to the implementation of the plan.
  C: This answer is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: This answer strengthens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff becoming more meticulous after they became aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
  E: This answer is irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- A plan was implemented to systematically record staff errors in several regional hospitals to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
- The incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since the implementation of the plan.
- The reason for the decrease is that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.

Thought:
- The argument is that the implementation of the plan to systematically record staff errors has led to a decrease in patient injuries.
- We need to find an option that strengthens this argument.

Evaluation:
- Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
- Option B weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is not necessarily due to the implementation of the plan.
- Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
- Option D strengthens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff becoming more meticulous after becoming aware of the monitoring.
- Option E is irrelevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("D")

Thought: 
  The argument is that the systematic recording of staff errors has led to a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports this claim.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C is irrelevant because it talks about errors that were not recorded.
  Option E is irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
  Option A weakens the argument because it suggests that the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient, which means that the decrease in patient injuries could be due to this policy rather than the plan.
  Option D strengthens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, which supports the claim that the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals' staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- A plan was implemented to systematically record staff errors in several regional hospitals to reduce patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
- The incidence of patient injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since the implementation of the plan.
- The reason for the decrease in patient injuries is attributed to the knowledge that staff errors were being carefully monitored.
Choices:
A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.

Thought:
The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors has led to a decrease in patient injuries. The reason for the decrease is attributed to the knowledge that staff errors were being carefully monitored. To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports this reasoning.

A: This option talks about a policy that was already in place before the implementation of the plan. It does not provide any information that strengthens the argument.
B: This option talks about a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan. It does not provide any information that strengthens the argument.
C: This option talks about staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not. It does not provide any information that strengthens the argument.
D: This option supports the argument by stating that the decrease in patient injuries began only after the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. This suggests that the knowledge of being monitored was a significant factor in reducing patient injuries.
E: This option talks about the consequences of staff errors. It does not provide any information that strengthens the argument.

Criticism:
Option A, B, C, and E do not provide any information that strengthens the argument. Option D is a bit vague and does not provide any concrete evidence to support the argument. However, it does suggest that the knowledge of being monitored was a significant factor in reducing patient injuries.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan.
  If we can find evidence that supports this suggestion, it would strengthen the argument.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument.
  Option B suggests that there might be other reasons for the decrease in patient injuries, so it weakens the argument.
  Option C suggests that the plan might not have been comprehensive enough, so it weakens the argument.
  Option D suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff's awareness of the close analysis of the records, which supports the argument.
  Option E is not relevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  Option D is not conclusive evidence that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff's awareness of the close analysis of the records. It is possible that other factors contributed to the decrease.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument is that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan to record staff errors.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries is likely due to the plan and not some other factor.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be due to the plan.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: This statement strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries is likely due to the plan.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to systematically record staff errors to reduce patient injuries.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument is that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the hospitals' staffs becoming more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties because they knew their errors were being monitored.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer that supports this claim.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries may not be due to the plan implemented by the hospitals.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: This statement supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the staff becoming more careful after they knew their errors were being monitored.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The hospitals implemented a plan to record all staff errors to reduce patient injuries resulting from staff errors.
- The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
- The argument suggests that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan, which made the staff more meticulous in carrying out their duties.
- To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports the idea that the plan caused the decrease in patient injuries.
Evaluation:
- A: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument. It talks about a policy that was in place before the implementation of the plan, which does not affect the argument.
- B: This answer choice weakens the argument. If a hospital that did not participate in the plan also saw a decrease in patient injuries, then the decrease cannot be solely attributed to the implementation of the plan.
- C: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument. It talks about errors that were not recorded, which does not affect the argument.
- D: This answer choice strengthens the argument. If the decrease in patient injuries did not begin until the staff became aware of the records being analyzed, then it supports the idea that the plan caused the decrease in patient injuries.
- E: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument. It talks about the consequences of staff errors, which does not affect the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The hospitals implemented a plan to record staff errors.
  The incidence of patient injuries has decreased since the implementation of the plan.
Thought:
  The argument is that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors caused the staff to be more careful and resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries was a direct result of the implementation of the plan.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  Choice D strengthens the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was a direct result of the staff becoming aware that their errors were being monitored.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism:
  Choice D only suggests a correlation between the decrease in patient injuries and the staff becoming aware of the monitoring. It does not prove causation.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded
  E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The CEO is arguing that the corporation is environmentally responsible because their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did.
  The CEO also argues that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Choices:
  A: This choice is relevant to the CEO's argument because the CEO is assuming that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution. However, the CEO does not take this for granted, but rather argues that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
  B: This choice is not relevant to the CEO's argument because the CEO is not comparing different causes that can have similar effects.
  C: This choice is relevant to the CEO's argument because the CEO is generalizing too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. The CEO is assuming that because they have reduced pollution, they are environmentally responsible, and therefore cannot be criticized for not being environmentally responsible.
  D: This choice is relevant to the CEO's argument because the CEO is assuming that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded. However, the CEO does not take this for granted, but rather argues that their current production methods pollute significantly less than their old methods did.
  E: This choice is relevant to the CEO's argument because the CEO is assuming that there are currently no production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now. However, the CEO does not ignore this possibility, but rather argues that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Thought:
  The CEO's argument is flawed because they are generalizing too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms. The CEO is assuming that because they have reduced pollution, they are environmentally responsible, and therefore cannot be criticized for not being environmentally responsible. However, this is not necessarily true, as there may be other ways in which the corporation is not environmentally responsible.
Criticism:
  The CEO's argument is also flawed because they are assuming that there are currently no methods that do not produce any pollution. However, this assumption may not be true, as there may be new methods that have not yet been developed or discovered.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether
Choices:
  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile
  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile
  D: there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered
  E: the average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Larew argues that the lowest income quintile had a higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than the highest quintile, and that their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's.
  Mendota disagrees with Larew's conclusion.
Thought:
  Larew and Mendota disagree about whether the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
  Mendota argues that the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile, which suggests that the economic prosperity of the highest quintile increased more than that of the lowest quintile.
  Therefore, the answer is A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
Criticism:
  The answer is not E, as this is a statement that Larew makes and Mendota disagrees with. The question asks what they disagree about, not what Larew said.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Larew argues that people in the lowest income quintile had a higher percentage increase in average income than those in the highest quintile, indicating an increase in relative economic prosperity.
  Mendota disagrees and argues that the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Thought:
  Larew and Mendota disagree about how to measure the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest.
  Larew argues that the percentage change in average income is a good measure of relative economic prosperity, while Mendota argues that the absolute amount of the increase in average income is a better measure.
  Therefore, the answer is A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Larew argues that the lowest income quintile had a higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than the highest quintile, so their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's.
  Mendota disagrees with Larew's argument.
Thought: 
  Larew and Mendota disagree about whether the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income or not.
  Mendota argues that the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile, so the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is not accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
  Therefore, the answer is A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
Criticism: 
  There is no disagreement between Larew and Mendota about whether the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income or not.
  Mendota's argument is about the absolute amount of the increase in average income, not the accuracy of measuring the change in economic prosperity.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Larew and Mendota are discussing the change in average income of the lowest and highest income quintiles over the last ten years.
  Larew argues that the percentage increase in average income of the lowest quintile was higher than that of the highest quintile, indicating an increase in their economic prosperity relative to the highest quintile.
  Mendota disagrees, arguing that while the percentage increase may be higher for the lowest quintile, the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Thought: 
  Larew and Mendota are disagreeing about the best way to measure the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest.
  Larew argues that comparing the percentage increase in average income is a valid way to measure this change, while Mendota argues that the absolute amount of the increase in average income is a better measure.
  Therefore, they are disagreeing about whether the change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
  The answer is A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development in Figoria must be regulated and offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.

Thought: 
  The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on the assumption that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands. If this assumption is false, then the offsetting of wetland development with the construction of replacement wetland habitats will not protect wildlife.
  A, C, D, and E are not assumptions on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
- The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
Thought:
- The Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument is based on the assumption that the replacement wetland habitats will be able to support the same species as the natural wetland habitats.
- If the replacement wetland habitats cannot support the same species, then the development would still pose a threat to the species that inhabit the wetlands.
- Therefore, the assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends is that the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
- Choice B captures this assumption.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is discussing the difficulty in identifying the responsible party for a pollution incident and the severity of the penalty for such an infraction.
  A: This principle suggests that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of guilt before imposing the penalty.
  B: This principle discusses the appropriate level of penalties for crimes, but it does not directly relate to the argument.
  C: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused, but it does not directly relate to the argument.
  D: This principle suggests that severe penalties may discourage someone from admitting responsibility, but it does not directly relate to the argument.
  E: This principle directly relates to the argument by suggesting that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it cannot be justified by the evidence.
Thought: 
  The argument is discussing the difficulty of identifying the responsible party for a pollution incident and the severity of the penalty for such an infraction.
  The argument suggests that the penalty is too severe to impose without stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility.
  Principle E directly relates to the argument by suggesting that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it cannot be justified by the evidence.
  Therefore, Principle E most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of identifying the polluter responsible for a recent river pollution incident and the severity of the penalty for this type of pollution.
  A: This principle suggests that the more severe the penalty, the higher the standard of proof required to impose it.
  B: This principle is not directly related to the argument.
  C: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused, but it is not directly related to the argument.
  D: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty may discourage someone from admitting responsibility for an offense.
  E: This principle is similar to principle A, but it emphasizes that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it is impossible to meet the standard of proof required to impose it.
Thought: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of identifying the polluter responsible for a recent river pollution incident and the severity of the penalty for this type of pollution.
  The argument suggests that the penalty is severe enough that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is required to impose it.
  Principle A supports this argument by suggesting that the more severe the penalty, the higher the standard of proof required to impose it.
  Therefore, principle A is the most helpful principle to justify the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about justifying the imposition of a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river.
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also states that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Thought:
  The argument is about justifying the imposition of a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river.
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also states that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  The argument implies that the severity of the penalty is an important factor in determining whether or not to impose it.
  Therefore, the principle that most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of identifying the responsible party for a pollution incident that occurred in a river.
  The penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument suggests that stronger evidence is needed or the perpetrator must admit responsibility before imposing the penalty.
Thought:
  The argument is about the difficulty of identifying the responsible party for a pollution incident that occurred in a river.
  The penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument suggests that stronger evidence is needed or the perpetrator must admit responsibility before imposing the penalty.
  Choice A is the most relevant principle that helps to justify the reasoning in the argument.
  If the penalty for an infraction is severe, then one must be more certain of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty on that party.
  This principle supports the argument that stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is needed before imposing the penalty.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Criticism:
  There is no significant flaw in the logic used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting a river.
  A: The principle states that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty.
  B: The principle states that penalties should be severe enough to deter people from committing crimes, but not so severe as to undermine willingness to impose them.
  C: The principle states that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused by the infraction.
  D: The principle states that the more severe the penalty, the less likely someone will admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The principle states that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that one can never be certain of guilt to justify punishment.
Thought:
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting a river.
  The penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The identity of the polluter cannot be sufficiently certain to justify imposing the penalty.
  The reasoning is that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, the penalty cannot be imposed.
  Principle A states that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty.
  This principle supports the argument's reasoning that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is necessary before imposing the penalty.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
Criticism:
  The argument is not about the severity of the penalty, but rather the difficulty of identifying the polluter.
  Principle C is also relevant to the argument, as it suggests that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused by the infraction.
  However, Principle A is the most directly relevant to the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The argument is discussing the difficulty of identifying the polluter responsible for a certain type of pollution in a river.
  The argument suggests that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument concludes that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, the penalty cannot be imposed.
Thought:
  The argument is concerned with the severity of the penalty for the pollution.
  The argument suggests that the severity of the penalty is a factor in determining whether it is justified to impose the penalty.
  The argument concludes that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, the penalty cannot be imposed.
  Therefore, the principle that most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument is the one that relates to the severity of the penalty.
  A: This principle is consistent with the argument, as it suggests that a more severe penalty requires a higher standard of proof.
  B: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument, as it discusses the appropriate level of penalties in general, rather than the relationship between penalty severity and proof of guilt.
  C: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument, as it discusses the appropriate level of penalties in relation to the harm caused by an infraction, rather than the relationship between penalty severity and proof of guilt.
  D: This principle is not directly relevant to the argument, as it discusses the likelihood of someone admitting responsibility for an offense, rather than the relationship between penalty severity and proof of guilt.
  E: This principle most directly relates to the argument, as it suggests that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it is impossible to be certain of guilt before imposing punishment.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Criticism:
  There is no criticism to the selected answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is discussing the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a polluter without sufficient evidence.
  A: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should match the certainty of guilt.
  B: This principle discusses the appropriate level of penalties, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  C: This principle suggests that the severity of the penalty should match the harm caused, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  D: This principle suggests that severe penalties may discourage people from admitting responsibility, but it is not directly relevant to the argument.
  E: This principle directly addresses the argument by suggesting that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it cannot be justified by the evidence.
Thought:

  C: This principle states that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the harm caused by the infraction.
  D: This principle states that the more severe the penalty, the less likely someone will admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: This principle states that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it is impossible to be certain of guilt before imposing the penalty.
Thought: 
  The argument is about the difficulty of imposing a penalty on a polluter without sufficient evidence.
  The penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The severity of the penalty makes it difficult to impose it without sufficient evidence.
  Therefore, the principle that states that the severity of the penalty should not be so great that it is impossible to be certain of guilt before imposing the penalty most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument.
  The answer is E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Criticism: 
  The argument does not state that the penalty is so great that it is impossible to be certain of guilt before imposing the penalty. 
  Rather, it states that the penalty is severe enough that stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.
  Therefore, the principle in E is not the most helpful in justifying the reasoning in the argument.

Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  A: This principle states that customers have a right to know how their money is being used by the utility.
  B: This principle states that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: This principle states that an additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: This principle states that an additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: This principle states that a water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
Thought: 
  The government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam.
  The member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The principle that most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable is that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  The proposed use of the extra money from water bills to build new roads will benefit only some members of the community, rather than the entire community.
  Therefore, the principle in B most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills to build a dam.
  A member of the legislature has proposed using the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building the dam.
Thought:
  The columnist thinks that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  We need to find a principle that justifies the columnist's judgment.
  Option A is not relevant to the situation.
  Option B is somewhat relevant, but it does not directly address the situation.
  Option C is relevant because it suggests that the additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of, but we do not know if most of the utility's customers disapprove of building the dam.
  Option D is not relevant because the utility has already received approval to collect the additional charge on water bills.
  Option E is relevant because it suggests that the water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures. Building new roads is not a water-related expenditure.
  Therefore, option E is the best choice to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills to build a dam.
  A member of the legislature has proposed using the extra money to build new roads instead of building the dam.
Thought: 
  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The proposal is to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist believes that the extra money should be used to build the dam.
  Therefore, the columnist believes that the money designated for the dam should not be used for other projects.
  The principle that best justifies the columnist's judgment is that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer.

  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  The legislator's proposal is to spend the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist believes that the extra money from water bills should be used to build a dam.
  The principle that most helps to justify the columnist's judgment is that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  The dam would benefit the entire community by providing water, while building new roads would only benefit some members of the community.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
Criticism: 
  The principle that customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used could also be used to justify the columnist's judgment.
  However, it is not as directly related to the situation as the principle in choice B.
Action: Answer("B")

Thought:
  The columnist has judged that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  To justify this judgment, we need to find a principle that supports the idea that the extra money from water bills should be used to build the dam.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community. This principle does not help to justify the columnist's judgment because both building a dam and building new roads could be considered projects that benefit the entire community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of. This principle does not help to justify the columnist's judgment because there is no information provided about whether most of the utility's customers approve or disapprove of building a dam.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature. This principle does not help to justify the columnist's judgment because the legislature has already approved the additional charge.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures. This principle supports the idea that the extra money from water bills should be used to build the dam because building a dam is a water-related expenditure.

  The legislator wants to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist believes that building a dam is more important than building new roads.
  The question asks which principle justifies the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  Option A is not relevant to the judgment of the proposal.
  Option B is relevant, but it does not justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable.
  Option C is relevant because the proposal is to use the additional charge on water bills to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  Option D is not relevant because the utility has already received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills.
  Option E is relevant because the proposal is to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of water-related expenditures.
  Option C is the most relevant principle that justifies the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable because the proposal is to use the additional charge on water bills to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Florida panther population has increased from the 1970s but is still below the self-sustaining level of 250.
  The current habitat of the Florida panthers is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
Thought: 
  The Florida panther population has increased but is still below the self-sustaining level of 250.
  The current habitat of the Florida panthers is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  Therefore, unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  The answer is C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
Criticism: 
  There is no information to support the claim that some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality (A).
  The statement that if the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining is not supported by the information given (B).
  The statement that the population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level is not supported by the information given (D).
  The statement that today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s is contradicted by the information given (E).
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Florida panthers are an endangered species.
  The current population of Florida panthers is 70 to 100.
  The population of Florida panthers must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  The current habitat of Florida panthers is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
Thought:
  The population of Florida panthers must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  The current habitat of Florida panthers is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
  Therefore, unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  The answer is C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence to support the idea that some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality, so A is not necessarily true.
  B is not necessarily true because even if the population exceeds 250, it may not be self-sustaining without a larger habitat.
  D is not necessarily true because the population may increase beyond its current level if a larger habitat is acquired.
  E is not necessarily true because the passage only states that the population has increased, not that the habitat has.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Florida panthers are an endangered species.
  There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today.
  Their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.
  Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.
Thought: 
  The statements above suggest that the current habitat of the Florida panthers is not large enough to support any more of these animals, and that their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. 
  Therefore, it must be true that unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  The answer is C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the statements above to suggest that some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality, so A cannot be the correct answer.
  The fact that the population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining does not necessarily mean that it will be self-sustaining if it reaches that number, so B cannot be the correct answer.
  The statements above do not suggest that the population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level, so D cannot be the correct answer.
  The statements above do not provide any information about the size of the Florida panthers' habitat in the 1970s, so E cannot be the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")

Criticism: 
  There is no evidence to support the claim that some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality, so A cannot be the correct answer.
  B is incorrect because the statement says that the population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining, not that it will be self-sustaining if it exceeds 250.
  D is incorrect because the statement says that the population has increased from the 1970s, so it is not true that the population will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E is incorrect because the statement says nothing about the size of the panthers' habitat in the 1970s.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The Florida panther population is currently between 70 to 100.
  The population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining.
  The current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  The advertisement suggests that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Thought: 
  The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
  A: If some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened. However, the advertisement claims that the sample is representative of all new policyholders, so it is unlikely that all of them saved little or no money.
  B: If the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened. However, the advertisement does not provide information about the premiums paid by people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: If switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened. However, the advertisement does not provide information about other insurance companies or how much money policyholders could save by switching to them.
  D: If many of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened. However, the advertisement claims that the sample is representative of all new policyholders, so it is unlikely that all of them underestimated their savings.
  E: If people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened. However, the advertisement does not provide information about the characteristics of the new policyholders.
Criticism: 
  The argument in the advertisement could be criticized on the grounds that it fails to address adequately the possibility that the sample of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed is not representative of all new policyholders.

Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. 
  Option A suggests that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. If this is true, then the advertisement's claim that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  Option B suggests that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time. This option is not relevant to the advertisement's claim.
  Option C suggests that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. If this is true, then the advertisement's claim that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  Option D suggests that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. This option is not relevant to the advertisement's claim.
  Option E suggests that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders. If this is true, then the advertisement's claim that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  Option A and Option C both have the potential to weaken the advertisement's claim. However, Option C is less relevant to the advertisement's claim than Option A. Therefore, the answer is A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. 
Action: Answer("A")

  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  A: The possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka would weaken the argument.
  B: The argument does not mention anything about the difference in the amount paid by new and old policyholders of Popelka Auto Insurance.
  C: The argument does not consider the possibility of switching to another insurance company.
  D: The argument assumes that the new policyholders accurately reported the amount of money they saved.
  E: The argument does not address the possibility of disproportionate representation among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The advertisement is based on a survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  The survey reports that the new policyholders saved $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching to Popelka.
  The argument assumes that the survey is representative of all people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies.
  The argument does not consider the possibility that the survey results may not be representative of all people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies.
  Option A addresses this possibility.
  Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Thought:
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  Option A suggests that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. If this is true, then the average savings reported in the survey may not be accurate.
  Option B is not relevant to the argument made in the advertisement.
  Option C suggests that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. If this is true, then the argument in the advertisement may be weaker because it suggests that there are other insurance companies that could offer even greater savings.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument made in the advertisement.
  Option E suggests that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders. If this is true, then the argument in the advertisement may be weaker because it suggests that the sample of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed may not be representative of the general population.
  Option A, C, and E are all potential criticisms of the argument in the advertisement. However, option C is the most directly relevant to the argument made in the advertisement because it suggests that there are other insurance companies that could offer even greater savings. Therefore, the answer is C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.

  E: This option suggests that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka may be disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  However, the advertisement does not provide any evidence to support this claim.
  Option A suggests that some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed may have saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  Option B suggests that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders may pay less for their auto insurance, on average, than people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  Option C suggests that switching to another insurance company may enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  Option D suggests that some of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed may have underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  Option E suggests that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka may be disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
  Option C seems to be the most vulnerable to criticism because it suggests that switching to another insurance company may enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. This undermines the argument made in the advertisement that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  The advertisement concludes that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Thought: 
  A: If some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened.
  B: The argument in the advertisement does not make any assumptions about the auto insurance premiums paid by new policyholders versus those who have held policies for a longer period of time. This choice is not relevant to the argument.
  C: If switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened.
  D: The argument in the advertisement assumes that the savings reported by the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed are accurate. This choice is not relevant to the argument.
  E: If people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders, then the argument in the advertisement would be weakened.
Criticism: 
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument, and choice D assumes that the savings reported by the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed are inaccurate, which is not mentioned in the argument. 
  Choice A is possible, but it would not necessarily weaken the argument, as the advertisement claims that the savings are on average, and some policyholders may save more than $250.
  Choice C and E are both relevant to the argument and could weaken it.
Action: Answer("C")

Thought: 
  A: If some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the argument in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it overlooks this possibility.
  B: If the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time, then the argument in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it takes for granted something that may not be true.
  C: If switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka, then the argument in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it fails to address this possibility.
  D: If few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the argument in the advertisement is not vulnerable to criticism on this ground.
  E: If people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders, then the argument in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it fails to address this possibility.
Criticism: 
  The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.

  E: This option suggests that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  Option A is a possible criticism because the advertisement only reports the average savings, and it is possible that some policyholders saved little or no money.
  Option B is not a valid criticism because the advertisement does not make any assumptions about how much new policyholders pay compared to long-term policyholders.
  Option C is a possible criticism because the advertisement only claims that switching to Popelka will save policyholders money, but it does not consider the possibility that switching to another insurance company could save even more money.
  Option D is not a valid criticism because the advertisement does not make any assumptions about whether policyholders underestimated their savings.
  Option E is a possible criticism because the advertisement does not provide any information about the representativeness of the sample surveyed.
  The most vulnerable criticism is A or C.

Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
Thought:
  A: The argument in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism if some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. This would mean that the average savings of $250 a year is not representative of all new policyholders.
  B: The argument in the advertisement is not vulnerable to criticism on this ground because it does not make any assumptions about the amount paid by new policyholders compared to those who have held policies for a longer period of time.
  C: The argument in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism if switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. This would mean that the savings offered by Popelka are not the best available.
  D: The argument in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism if few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. This would mean that the average savings of $250 a year is not representative of all new policyholders.
  E: The argument in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism if people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders. This would mean that the sample surveyed is not representative of all auto insurance policyholders.
  
  The most vulnerable criticism is C, as the argument does not address the possibility that there may be other insurance companies that offer even greater savings than Popelka, making the savings offered by Popelka not the best available. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  The advertisement suggests that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Thought: 
  The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
  A: If at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  B: If the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time, then the claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  C: If switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka, then the claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  D: If some of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka, then the claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
  E: If people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders, then the claim that most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka would be weakened.
Criticism: 
  The advertisement claims that a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  However, the advertisement does not provide any information about the size of the sample or the representativeness of the sample.
  Therefore, the argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it is not clear whether the sample is representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

  The second group of doctors argues that the brain's natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  Therefore, the answer choice that supports this argument would be the best answer.
  Answer choice A does not support either group's argument.
  Answer choice B supports the second group's argument by stating that some diseases can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  Answer choice C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Answer choice D does not support either group's argument.
  Answer choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin.
  One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns.
  A second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Thought: 
  The second group of doctors argues that the brain's natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  If there are diseases that occur in newborns that can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, then the first group of doctors' position would be stronger.
  Therefore, B most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared two groups of people, Group A (65-75 years old) and Group B (college students).
  Each person in both groups was required to make a telephone call at a specified time.
  The time of each call was recorded electronically.
  Group A had only one lapse, while Group B had fourteen lapses.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The evidence is that Group A (65-75 years old) had only one lapse, while Group B (college students) had fourteen lapses.
  A: The number of people in each group being the same is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it eliminates the possibility that the difference in the number of people in each group affected the results.
  B: The same group of researchers answering the calls made by the callers in both study groups is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it eliminates the possibility that the researchers' behavior affected the results.
  C: Among the college students, there were no persons more than forty years old is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it eliminates the possibility that the results were affected by the presence of older college students who might have performed better than younger college students.
  D: Both groups having unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it eliminates the possibility that the results were affected by differences in access to telephones.
  E: The members of the two groups receiving their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it eliminates the possibility that the results were affected by differences in the amount of time the groups had to prepare for the task.
  Therefore, the least helpful option in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn is the option that does not eliminate any possibility that could affect the results. 
  The option that does not eliminate any possibility is C: Among the college students, there were no persons more than forty years old.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students).
  Each member of both groups was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time, and the time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically.
  Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
Thought: 
  The conclusion of the study is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, as Group A (composed of older individuals) performed better than Group B (composed of college students) in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  To establish that the conclusion is properly drawn, we need to identify the option that is LEAST helpful in supporting the conclusion.
  Option A is helpful in establishing that the study was conducted with similar sample sizes for both groups, so it is not the least helpful.
  Option B is helpful in establishing that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, so it is not the least helpful.
  Option C is helpful in establishing that the college students in Group B were all under forty years old, which could be a factor in their performance, so it is not the least helpful.
  Option D is helpful in establishing that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, so it is not the least helpful.
  Option E is helpful in establishing that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, so it is the least helpful in supporting the conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), in terms of their ability to remember to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  Group A had only one lapse, while Group B had fourteen lapses.
Thought:
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  We need to find the option that is least helpful in establishing this conclusion.
  A: This option is helpful because it establishes that the two groups are comparable in size, which is important for making valid comparisons.
  B: This option is helpful because it establishes that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which reduces the possibility of bias.
  C: This option is helpful because it establishes that there were no older people in Group B who might have performed better than the younger college students.
  D: This option is helpful because it establishes that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which is important for ensuring that the results are not affected by differences in access to technology.
  E: This option is helpful because it establishes that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which is important for ensuring that the results are not affected by differences in the amount of time available for preparation.
  Therefore, the least helpful option is the one that is not relevant to memory or the ability to make a telephone call at a specified time.
  Option C is not relevant to memory or the ability to make a telephone call at a specified time.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer.

  The study compared two groups of people: Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students).
  Each member of both groups was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time, and the time of each call was recorded electronically.
  Group A had only one lapse, while Group B had fourteen lapses.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the fact that Group A performed better than Group B in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  To establish that the conclusion is properly drawn, we need to find the option that is least helpful in supporting the conclusion.
  Option A is helpful because it tells us that the two groups had the same number of people, which makes the comparison between them more valid.
  Option B is helpful because it tells us that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which eliminates the possibility of bias in the way the calls were answered.
  Option C is helpful because it tells us that there were no older people in Group B, which eliminates the possibility that the age of the participants in Group B affected their memory performance.
  Option D is helpful because it tells us that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones, which eliminates the possibility that the availability of telephones affected their memory performance.
  Option E is helpful because it tells us that the members of both groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which eliminates the possibility that the timing of the instructions affected their memory performance.
  Therefore, the least helpful option is one that does not provide any information that is relevant to the conclusion.
  Option A, B, C, and D are all helpful in supporting the conclusion, but option E is not relevant to the conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:

  The study compared the ability of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), to remember to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  Group A performed better than Group B, with only one lapse compared to fourteen lapses in Group B.
Thought: 
  The conclusion drawn is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, as Group A, composed of older individuals, performed better than Group B, composed of college students.
  To establish that the conclusion is properly drawn, we need to identify the option that is LEAST helpful.
  A: This option is helpful in establishing that the two groups were of equal size, which is important for the study's validity. Therefore, this option is not the least helpful.
  B: This option is helpful in establishing that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which is important for the study's validity. Therefore, this option is not the least helpful.
  C: This option is helpful in establishing that there were no persons more than forty years old among the college students, which is important for the study's validity. Therefore, this option is not the least helpful.
  D: This option is helpful in establishing that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which is important for the study's validity. Therefore, this option is not the least helpful.
  E: This option is helpful in establishing that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which is important for the study's validity. Therefore, this option is not the least helpful.
  Based on the above analysis, the least helpful option is the one that is the least important for the study's validity. Option C, which states that among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old, is the least helpful, as it does not have any direct impact on the study's validity or the conclusion drawn. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared the ability of two groups, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), to remember to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The study compared the ability of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time.
  Group A had only one lapse, while Group B had fourteen lapses.
Thought: 
  The conclusion drawn is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, as Group A (older adults) performed better than Group B (college students) in making a telephone call at a specified time.
  To establish that the conclusion is properly drawn, we need to look for the option that is least helpful in supporting the conclusion.
  Option A is helpful as it tells us that both groups had the same number of people, which makes the comparison between the two groups more valid.
  Option B is helpful as it tells us that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which eliminates any potential bias in the results.
  Option C is helpful as it tells us that there were no older individuals in the college student group, which eliminates the possibility that the age of the college students affected the results.
  Option D is helpful as it tells us that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which eliminates any potential confounding factors.
  Option E is helpful as it tells us that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which eliminates any potential confounding factors.
  Therefore, the least helpful option is difficult to identify, but if we had to choose, it would be option C, as it is the only option that does not directly relate to the comparison between the two groups.

Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The study involved two groups of people: Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students).
  Each member of the two groups was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time.
  Group A was far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B.
  There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A.
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  To establish this conclusion, we need to show that Group A's superior performance was due to their age and not some other factor.
  Answer choice A is helpful because it establishes that the two groups were of equal size, which means that the difference in performance cannot be attributed to a difference in sample size.
  Answer choice B is helpful because it establishes that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups, which means that any differences in performance cannot be attributed to differences in how the calls were answered.
  Answer choice C is helpful because it establishes that there were no persons more than forty years old among the college students, which means that any differences in performance cannot be attributed to the presence of older individuals in Group A.
  Answer choice D is helpful because it establishes that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls, which means that any differences in performance cannot be attributed to differences in access to telephones.
  Answer choice E is helpful because it establishes that the members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls, which means that any differences in performance cannot be attributed to differences in the amount of time they had to prepare.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.
Question: The reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: widespread cynicism is beneficial to the wellbeing of society
  B: cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the am01mt of information one has about them

  Your answer is correct. The commentator's argument assumes that the level of cynicism among journalists has not increased over time, which may not be true. 
  It is possible that the increased cynicism of contemporary journalists is having a negative effect on the well-being of society.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the amount of information one has about them.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Resident: Data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in our town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe. Hence, at least 60 percent of our town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Question: The reasoning in the resident's argument is flawed in that the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the town has a relatively small number of houses
  B: inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe
  C: structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage
  D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe
  E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The resident's argument states that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Thought:
  The resident's argument is that the total percentage of houses with problems is at least 60%.
  The argument does not consider the possibility that some houses have both problems.
  If some houses have both problems, then the total percentage of houses with problems would be less than 60%.
  Therefore, the answer is E: some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct.
  The argument does not consider the possibility that some houses have both problems.
  If some houses have both problems, then the total percentage of houses with problems would be less than 60%.
  Therefore, the answer is E: some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The resident argues that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The resident supports this argument by stating that 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  A: The size of the town is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The resident acknowledges that inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe.
  C: The ease of fixing the problems is not relevant to the argument.
  D: This is a possibility that the argument does not address.
  E: This is a possibility that the argument does not address.
Thought:
  The resident's argument is based on the assumption that the two problems are mutually exclusive.
  However, it is possible that some houses have both inadequate site drainage and structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  If this is the case, then the actual percentage of houses with problems could be lower than 60%.
  Therefore, the argument overlooks the possibility that some houses have both problems.
  The answer is E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that some houses have both problems.
  Therefore, the answer is E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The resident claims that 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Thought:
  The resident's argument assumes that the problems of inadequate site drainage and structural defects are mutually exclusive.
  However, it is possible that some houses have both problems.
  If some houses have both problems, then the percentage of houses with problems would be less than 60%.
  Therefore, the argument overlooks the possibility that some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
  The correct answer is E.
Criticism:
  Your reasoning is correct.
  The argument does not overlook the possibility that the town has a relatively small number of houses, that inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe, that structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage, or that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The resident claims that 30% of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Thought: 
  The resident's argument assumes that the two problems are mutually exclusive, i.e., that a house can have either inadequate site drainage or structural defects, but not both.
  However, it is possible that some houses have both problems, which means that the actual percentage of houses with problems could be lower than 60%.
  Therefore, the argument overlooks the possibility that some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
  The correct answer is E.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The resident claims that 30% of houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Thought: 
  The resident's argument assumes that the two problems are mutually exclusive, which is not necessarily true.
  It is possible that some houses have both inadequate site drainage and structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  Therefore, the argument overlooks the possibility that some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
  The answer is E: some of the houses that have structural defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  There is no evidence in the argument to suggest that the town has a relatively small number of houses, so A is not relevant.
  B is not the correct answer because the argument already acknowledges that inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe.
  C is not relevant because the argument does not compare the difficulty of fixing the two problems.
  D is not relevant because the argument already acknowledges that 60% of houses have some kind of problem.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The resident's argument is that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
  The data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe.
  A: The size of the town is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in the town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe. Hence, the argument does not overlook the possibility that inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe.
  C: The argument does not address the relative ease of fixing structural defects versus inadequate site drainage.
  D: This possibility is addressed in the argument. The argument states that "at least" 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem, which means that some houses may not have any problems.
  E: This possibility is also addressed in the argument. The argument does not exclude the possibility that some houses have both inadequate site drainage and structural defects that could make them unsafe.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The study found that trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species in tropical forests.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Tolstoy claimed that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Choices:
  A: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist.
  B: This answer choice contradicts the argument made by the ethicist. The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  C: This answer choice restates the argument made by the ethicist. The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist.
  E: This answer choice contradicts Tolstoy's claim, but it is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist.
Thought: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Answer choice C restates the argument made by the ethicist.
  Therefore, answer choice C enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
  The answer is C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
Criticism: 
  I do not see any flaws in my logic and reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we are only justified in praising or blaming a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought: 
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim.
  The assumption that would enable the conclusion to be properly drawn is one that supports the idea that we are justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice C supports this idea, stating that we can only be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action when we regard that action as freely performed.
  Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:

  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought:
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn must support the idea that we can still praise or blame a person for an action even if we know a lot about the events leading up to that action.
  Choice A suggests that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control, but this assumption does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice B suggests that the responsibility for an act is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, which also does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice C suggests that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed, which contradicts the premise of the argument.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise varies with the amount of information available, which supports the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice E suggests that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed, but this assumption does not support the conclusion of the argument.
  Therefore, the assumption that enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn is D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Tolstoy claimed that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Choices:
  A: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist.
  B: This choice contradicts the argument made by the ethicist. The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. This choice claims that how much information others possess about an act does not determine whether the person doing it is genuinely responsible. 
  C: This choice restates the argument made by the ethicist. The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: This choice is not relevant to the argument made by the ethicist.
  E: This choice contradicts the argument made by the ethicist. The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. This choice claims that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Thought: 
  The argument made by the ethicist is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice C restates the argument made by the ethicist.
  Therefore, choice C enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought: 
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim.
  The assumption that would enable the conclusion to be properly drawn is one that supports the idea that we can still regard an action as freely performed even if we know a lot about the events leading up to it.
  Choice B supports this idea by stating that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  Therefore, choice B is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant flaw in the logic used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought:
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we are only justified in praising or blaming a person for an action when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Therefore, the assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn is that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  The answer is C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")

  The assumption that would enable the conclusion to be properly drawn is one that supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice A suggests that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. This does not support the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice B suggests that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This does not support the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice C suggests that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. This supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.

  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Thought: 
  The argument of the ethicist is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  To enable the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn, we need to find an assumption that links the two premises.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B suggests that the responsibility of a person doing an act is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This does not link the two premises.
  Choice C is a restatement of the first premise and does not link the two premises.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. This links the two premises because it suggests that the more information we have about the events leading up to an action, the more inclined we are to blame or praise the person who performed the action. 
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the assumption that enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn is D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Tolstoy claimed that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Choices:
  A: This statement is related to the issue of whether people should be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. However, it is not directly relevant to the conclusion of the ethicist's argument.
  B: This statement supports the conclusion of the ethicist's argument by suggesting that the amount of information others possess about an act does not determine whether the person doing it is genuinely responsible.
  C: This statement is restating the conclusion of the ethicist's argument, rather than enabling the conclusion to be properly drawn.
  D: This statement is related to the issue of how much responsibility a person bears for an action and how much we are inclined to blame or praise them. However, it is not directly relevant to the conclusion of the ethicist's argument.
  E: This statement is the opposite of Tolstoy's claim, but it is not directly relevant to the conclusion of the ethicist's argument.
Thought: 
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice B supports this conclusion by suggesting that the amount of information others possess about an act does not determine whether the person doing it is genuinely responsible.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Criticism: 
  I cannot think of any flaws in this answer.
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacist's argument is based on a study that showed that melatonin can alleviate insomnia symptoms in older adults.
  Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland.
  The pharmacist claims that the manufacturers' claims that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  A: Inferring from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect is a type of causal fallacy.
  B: Relying on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased is a type of fallacy of authority.
  C: Using two different meanings for the same term to draw a conclusion is a type of equivocation fallacy.
  D: Confusing an effect of a phenomenon with its cause is a type of causal fallacy.
  E: An unrepresentative sample is a type of sampling bias.
Thought: 
  The pharmacist's argument is that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct because a study showed that melatonin can alleviate insomnia symptoms in older adults.

Knowledge: 
  The pharmacist argues that a study showed that melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms.
  The pharmacist concludes that the claims made by melatonin supplement manufacturers are correct.
Thought:
  The pharmacist's argument seems to be that if melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms, then the claims made by melatonin supplement manufacturers about the pineal gland producing less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  However, the study does not necessarily support the claim that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  The study only shows that melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in older people.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Criticism:
  I cannot think of any flaws in my reasoning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The pharmacist argues that melatonin can alleviate insomnia symptoms in older adults.
  The pharmacist claims that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct.
Thought:
  The pharmacist's argument is that melatonin can alleviate insomnia symptoms in older adults because the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  The pharmacist uses a large study of people aged 65-81 to support the claim that melatonin can alleviate insomnia symptoms.
  The study does not support the claim that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  The study only shows that melatonin can alleviate insomnia symptoms in older adults.
  Therefore, the pharmacist's argument is flawed because it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.

Knowledge:
  The argument claims that melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in people aged 65-81.
  Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland.
  The argument claims that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
Thought:
  The argument concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
  The argument supports this conclusion by citing a large study that shows that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  However, the argument does not provide any evidence that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
  The correct answer is D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause.
Criticism:
  The argument does not infer from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect, so A is incorrect.
  The argument does not rely on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased, so B is incorrect.
  The argument does not depend on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion, so C is incorrect.
  The argument does not rely on a sample that is unrepresentative, so E is incorrect.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The physician conducted an experiment on 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  The patients were divided into two groups: one group received small magnets applied to their backs, while the other group received no treatment.
  Most of the patients in the magnet group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the no-treatment group did.
  The physician concludes that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the magnet group could be due to a placebo effect, rather than the magnets themselves. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  B: This statement presents an alternative treatment option, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  C: This statement suggests that the physician's conclusion may not be generalizable to other areas of pain. However, it does not directly counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  D: This statement suggests that there may have been bias in the design of the experiment, but it does not directly counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  E: This statement suggests that the variation in causes of the back pain may have affected the results of the experiment, and thus the physician's conclusion. This is the strongest counter to the physician's argument, as it suggests that the observed improvement in the magnet group may be due to factors other than the magnets themselves.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The physician conducted an experiment on 50 patients with chronic back pain.
  One group received small magnets applied to their backs, while the other group received no treatment.
  Most patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain, while very few in the second group reported the same.
Thought: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to provide evidence that weakens the physician's conclusion.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing back pain.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing back pain.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing back pain.
  D: This statement is not relevant to the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing back pain.
  E: This statement provides a strong counter to the physician's argument. The wide variation in the specific causes of chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could have affected the results. For example, some causes of chronic back pain may be more responsive to magnetic fields than others. Therefore, the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing back pain cannot be concluded from this experiment alone.
Criticism: 
  The answer is logically sound and provides a strong counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the surprising result?
Choices:
  A: For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
  B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
  C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.

  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Thought: 
  One possible explanation for the surprising result is that customers who came to the store to buy Maxlast hammers on sale may have also bought Styron hammers while they were there.
  Choice A is not relevant to the explanation of the surprising result.
  Choice B suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices, which contradicts the fact that Maxlast hammers were put on sale.
  Choice C suggests that customers bought Maxlast hammers because they were on sale, but it does not explain why they did not buy Styron hammers.
  Choice D suggests that the sale on Maxlast hammers was advertised, but it does not explain why customers chose to buy Styron hammers instead.
  Choice E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, but it does not explain why customers who were already in the store did not buy Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, the most plausible explanation for the surprising result is that customers who came to the store to buy Maxlast hammers on sale may have also bought Styron hammers while they were there.

  Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Thought:
  The sale on Maxlast hammers should have made them more attractive to customers.
  However, the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, there must be some other factor that made the Styron hammers more attractive to customers.
  Option A suggests that customers do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise for the first several seconds after entering the store. This could mean that customers did not notice the sale on Maxlast hammers immediately upon entering the store, but noticed the Styron hammers first and decided to purchase them instead.
  Option B suggests that customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices. This could mean that customers chose to purchase the Styron hammers because they perceive them to be of higher quality than the Maxlast hammers, even though they were not on sale.
  Option C suggests that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time. This does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers this week.
  Option D suggests that the hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers. This could mean that customers who came to the store specifically for the sale on Maxlast hammers bought them, but other customers chose to purchase the Styron hammers instead.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store. This does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers this week.
  Therefore, the best answer is either A or B.
Criticism:
  Option A could be true, but it does not necessarily explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers. It only suggests a reason why customers may not have noticed the sale on Maxlast hammers immediately upon entering the store.

  Option D suggests that the sale was advertised, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers this week.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers this week.
  Option B is the most plausible explanation for the surprising result, as it suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices and are instead attracted by quality and service.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  A: This choice suggests that shoppers do not pay attention to the merchandise in the store when they first enter.
  B: This choice suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices.
  C: This choice suggests that customers who bought Maxlast hammers did so because they were on sale.
  D: This choice suggests that the hardware store advertised the sale prices of Maxlast hammers.
  E: This choice suggests that a single item on sale is not enough to motivate shoppers to make a special trip to the store.
Thought: 
  The surprising result is that Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers even though Maxlast hammers were on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance. 
  Choice C provides a possible explanation for this result. 
  If customers who bought Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, it could mean that the sale motivated them to buy a hammer even though they did not need one. 
  This would suggest that the sale did not increase the overall demand for hammers, but rather shifted demand from Styron to Maxlast hammers. 
  Therefore, when the sale ended and Maxlast hammers returned to their usual price, customers who were not motivated by the sale switched back to buying Styron hammers.
  Choice A, B, D, and E do not provide a plausible explanation for the surprising result.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.

  The Maxlast hammers were on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance, but the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. 
  The Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option A does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option B suggests that customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices, which could explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option C suggests that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option D suggests that the hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers, which could have attracted customers to the store, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option E suggests that a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, which could explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option B and E are the most plausible explanations for the surprising result.
  However, option E is more relevant to the situation because it specifically addresses the effect of a sale on shoppers' behavior.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant criticism to the answer. 
  However, option B could also be a plausible explanation for the surprising result because it suggests that customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
  Therefore, the answer could also be B.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The hardware store sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast and Styron brand hammers.
  Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Thought: 
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale and placed in a prominent location.
  Option A suggests that shoppers do not take detailed notice of merchandise for the first several seconds after entering the store. This could explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers, as shoppers may have simply grabbed the first hammer they saw without realizing that the Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Option B suggests that customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices. This does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  Option C suggests that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time. This does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers this week.
  Option D suggests that the hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers. This could explain why the Maxlast hammers sold well last week, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers this week.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store. This does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers this week.
  Therefore, the best explanation for the surprising result is Option A: For the first several seconds after shoppers enter a store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
Criticism: 
  It is possible that Option D could also explain the surprising result. If the flyers publicizing the sale prices on Maxlast hammers were still visible in the store this week, shoppers may have been more likely to buy Styron hammers because they did not see the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  However, Option A is still the most likely explanation because it directly addresses the fact that the Maxlast hammers were placed in a prominent location but were still outsold by the Styron hammers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers.
  Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Thought: 
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Option A is not relevant to the surprising result.
  Option B suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices, which would explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers. However, it is not clear whether this is true or not.
  Option C suggests that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers did so because of the sale. This does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option D suggests that the hardware store advertised the sale prices on Maxlast hammers. This could have attracted more customers to the store, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store. This is not relevant to the surprising result.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
Criticism: 
  It is possible that the hardware store's customers are motivated by low prices, but the quality and service of the store are so good that customers are willing to pay the regular price for Styron hammers.
  However, this is not a strong criticism of the answer because it is still the most likely explanation for the surprising result.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.

  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
    This statement does not undermine the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. It provides an alternative perspective, but it does not necessarily contradict the idea that the survey respondents were biased.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
    This statement does not undermine the argument that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. It provides an alternative perspective, but it does not necessarily contradict the idea that the survey respondents were biased.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.

  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Thought:
  The argument assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is the only factor that has affected the company's net income from sales of the product.
  The argument does not consider the possibility that the total sales of hair dryers may have increased over the past 5 years, which could offset the decline in market share.
  The argument also assumes that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has remained constant over the past 5 years.
  If the retail price has increased, then the company's net income from sales of the product may not have declined as much as the argument suggests.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed because it overlooks other factors that could affect the company's net income from sales of the product.
  The answer is D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years.
Criticism:
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer sales have declined from 50% to 25% of all hair dryer sales nationwide in the last 5 years.
  The argument also claims that the average net income per hair dryer sold by Wilson Appliance Company has not changed over the last 5 years.
Thought:
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  However, the argument does not provide any evidence to support this conclusion.
  The argument assumes that the decline in market share is the only factor that has affected the company's net income.
  The argument does not consider other factors that could have affected the company's net income, such as changes in production costs or changes in the retail price of the hair dryer.
Criticism:
  The argument assumes that the decline in market share is the only factor that has affected the company's net income.
  The argument does not provide any evidence to support the conclusion that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer accounted for 50% of all sales of hair dryers nationwide 5 years ago, but now it only accounts for 25% of such sales. 
  The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years. 
  Finally, the argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Thought:
  The argument assumes that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is the only factor affecting the company's net income from sales of the product. 
  However, there could be other factors that have contributed to the decline in net income, such as increased competition or changes in production costs. 
  Additionally, the argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the past 5 years, which may not be true. 
  Therefore, the reasoning in the argument is flawed.
  Choice A accurately identifies the flaw in the argument by pointing out that the argument mistakes a decline in market share for a decline in total sales.
Criticism:
  There is no criticism of choice A. It accurately identifies the flaw in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The argument talks about the decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer.
  The argument mentions that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
Thought:
  The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the past 5 years.
  The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold is the same for all companies producing hair dryers.
  The argument assumes that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is the only product that the company sells.
  The argument assumes that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has not changed over the past 5 years.
  The argument assumes that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's most profitable products.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the argument is flawed because it makes several assumptions that may not be true.
Criticism:
  The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the past 5 years, but it is possible that the total sales of hair dryers have increased or decreased over the past 5 years.
  The argument assumes that the average net income per hair dryer sold is the same for all companies producing hair dryers, but it is possible that different companies have different profit margins.
  The argument assumes that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is the only product that the company sells, but it is possible that the company sells other products that may be more profitable.
  The argument assumes that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer has not changed over the past 5 years, but it is possible that the retail price has increased or decreased.
  The argument assumes that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's most profitable products, but it is possible that the company has other products that are more profitable.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  A: The presence of other animal species on the islands that are not found in the Americas does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about the iguanas.
  B: Genetic differences between the iguana species on the islands and those found in the Americas do not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
  D: The presence of fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands in Australia does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
  E: The fact that numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana does weaken the scientist's argument that the iguanas must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguanas must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  If there are numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America that date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, then it is possible that the iguanas could have originated from a common ancestor that lived before the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  Therefore, E weakens the scientist's argument the most.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on a small group of islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  A: The presence of other animal species on the islands that are not found in the Americas does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about the iguanas.
  B: Genetic differences between the iguana species on the islands and those found in the Americas may support the scientist's argument, but it does not necessarily weaken it.
  C: If documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon, it could weaken the scientist's argument that the iguanas rafted from the Americas to the islands.
  D: The presence of fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands in Australia could weaken the scientist's argument that the iguanas rafted from the Americas to the islands.
  E: The fact that numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about the iguanas.
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguanas on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  If there are few documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses, it could weaken the scientist's argument.
  Therefore, C may be the answer.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct. 
  However, it is possible that the iguanas could have rafted from the Americas to the islands even if documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  Therefore, C may not be the answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the small group of islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  A: The presence of other animal species on the islands is not relevant to the argument about the iguana species.
  B: Genetic analysis indicating differences between the iguana species on the islands and those found in the Americas does not necessarily weaken the argument that the progenitors of the island species rafted across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances does not necessarily weaken the argument that the progenitors of the island species rafted across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  D: The presence of fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands in Australia does not necessarily weaken the argument that the progenitors of the island species rafted across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  E: The fact that numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana suggests that the iguana species may have been present on the islands prior to the formation of the islands.
Thought: 
  The argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  If the iguana species were present on the islands prior to the formation of the islands, then the argument that the progenitors of the island species rafted across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas would be weakened.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. 
  The fact that numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana suggests that the iguana species may have been present on the islands prior to the formation of the islands, which weakens the argument that the progenitors of the island species rafted across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.

Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguanas on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  If the lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, it could suggest that the iguanas on the islands near Australia are not related to those in the Americas.
  Therefore, E weakens the scientist's argument the most.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  A: The presence of other animal species on the islands that are not found in the Americas does not directly weaken the scientist's argument about the iguanas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicating differences between the iguana species on the islands and those in the Americas could potentially weaken the argument.
  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances does not directly weaken the scientist's argument.
  D: The presence of fossils of closely related iguana species in Australia could potentially weaken the argument.
  E: The lineage of numerous plant and animal species dating back to before the fragmentation of Gondwana could potentially weaken the argument.
Thought:
  The scientist argues that the iguanas on the islands must have rafted from the Americas.
  If the iguanas on the islands are genetically different from those in the Americas, it could suggest that they did not raft over from the Americas.
  Therefore, B could weaken the scientist's argument.
Criticism:
  There is no criticism to this answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.

  C: The rarity of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances does not directly weaken the scientist's argument about the iguanas.
  D: The discovery of fossils of iguana species closely related to those on the islands in Australia could potentially weaken the scientist's argument.
  E: The age of lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or South America prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana does not directly weaken the scientist's argument about the iguanas.
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguanas on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  If the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, then it is possible that they did not originate from the Americas.
  Therefore, B could potentially weaken the scientist's argument.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that B could potentially weaken the scientist's argument.
  However, the argument is based on the assumption that the iguanas must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  Even if the iguanas on the islands are different from those found in the Americas, it is still possible that they originated from the Americas and evolved differently on the islands.
  Therefore, B does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  A: The presence of other animal species on the islands that are not found in the Americas does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about the iguanas.
  B: Genetic differences between the iguanas on the islands and those found in the Americas do not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
  C: The uncommonness of documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
  D: The presence of fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands in Australia does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
  E: The fact that numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument about how the iguanas got to the islands.
Thought:
  The argument states that the iguanas on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that contradicts this statement.
  Option D states that fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  This contradicts the argument that the iguanas must have rafted from the Americas to the islands.
  Therefore, option D weakens the scientist's argument the most.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument states that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that the iguana species on the islands may have evolved differently from those found in the Americas, rather than being the result of rafting.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: This statement weakens the argument by suggesting that iguana species closely related to those on the islands were present in Australia, which would make it less likely that the progenitors of the island iguanas rafted from the Americas.
  E: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.
Thought:
  The argument is that the iguanas on the islands must have rafted from the Americas.
  If closely related iguana species were found in Australia, it would be less likely that the progenitors of the island iguanas rafted from the Americas.
  Therefore, D weakens the argument the most.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  A: Some animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas, but this does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas, but this does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon, but this does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, which would weaken the scientist's argument.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana, but this does not necessarily weaken the scientist's argument.
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguana species on the islands near Australia must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  If fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, then the iguanas on the islands near Australia could have come from Australia instead of the Americas.
  Therefore, D weakens the scientist's argument.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

  The council members argue that the increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist does not address the council members' argument that the latest safety technology would mitigate the safety risks.
  Therefore, the editorialist's argument is flawed because it fails to consider the possibility that the latest safety technology could make it safe to increase air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity.
  The best answer is B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity would decrease safety, even with the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist cites studies conducted 30 years ago to support their argument.
Choices:
  A: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist draws a conclusion based on a limited number of instances (studies conducted 30 years ago) and infers a general statement from those instances.
  B: This choice is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that the latest technology could allow for an increase in air traffic without reducing safety. The editorialist specifically mentions that council members argue that the latest safety technology would accompany the increase in air traffic.
  C: This choice is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that council members are aware of the studies conducted 30 years ago. The argument is based on the premise that the increase in air traffic would decrease safety, regardless of the council members' knowledge of the studies.
  D: This choice accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The editorialist confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim. The editorialist cites studies conducted 30 years ago, but does not provide evidence that the latest safety technology would not be effective in increasing the airport's capacity.
  E: This choice is not a flaw in the editorialist's argument. The argument is based on the premise that safety would be decreased by the increase in air traffic, regardless of any potential benefits.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion

  You are correct that the argument is vulnerable to criticism because it uses statistical evidence that fails to support the conclusion that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  However, the argument does not take statistical evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.
  Rather, the argument takes statistical evidence that fails to support the conclusion and uses it to support the opposite conclusion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  A: This choice suggests that the argument overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  B: This choice suggests that the argument fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.
  C: This choice suggests that the argument takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  D: This choice suggests that the argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
  E: This choice suggests that the argument takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  However, the argument does not consider other factors that could affect the safety of bicyclists, such as the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
  The answer is A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. However, it is important to note that the argument could also be criticized on other grounds, such as the possibility that the statistics used in the argument are not reliable or that the argument assumes that all bicycle lanes are designed and implemented in the same way.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: While it is true that bees' vision is well suited to the task of identifying flowers by their colors, it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the statement above?
Choices:
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This fact does not support the statement above.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This fact does not support the statement above.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This fact does not support the statement above.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This fact does not support the statement above.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This fact does not support the statement above.
Thought: 
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
  If true, the most strongly supports the statement above would be a fact that suggests that flowers were the ones that adapted to bees' vision.
  Therefore, the correct answer is the one that suggests that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  The only option that suggests this is A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
Criticism: 
  The answer is not clear-cut, as the statement is somewhat speculative and there could be other factors at play.
  However, option A is the most plausible answer, as it suggests that bees' vision is not the only factor that determines flower color.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color, which suggests that bees' vision may have developed in response to flower color.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees, which does not support or refute the statement.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees, which does not support or refute the statement.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees, which does not support or refute the statement.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, which suggests that bees' vision may have developed in response to flower color.
Thought:
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
  If many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color, then it is likely that bees' vision developed in response to flower color.

  If many insects with vision similar to bees do not depend on color perception, then it is less likely that flower color developed in response to bees' vision.
  If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, then it is less likely that flower color developed in response to bees' vision.
  If the number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees, then it is more likely that flower color developed in response to bees' vision.
  If many nonflowering plants rely on bees, then it is less likely that flower color developed in response to bees' vision.
  If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, then it is more likely that flower color developed in response to bees' vision.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Criticism:
  The answer is not conclusive evidence that flower color developed in response to bees' vision, but it does provide support for the statement above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:

  Therefore, A weakens the statement.
  If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  Therefore, B weakens the statement.
  If the number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  Therefore, C weakens the statement.
  If many nonflowering plants rely on bees, then it is less likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  Therefore, D weakens the statement.
  If present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food, then it is more likely that flowers developed in response to bees' color vision.
  Therefore, E supports the statement.

  Therefore, none of the options support the statement.
  None of the above is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: Many insects with vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. This does not provide evidence that flowers did not develop in response to bees' vision.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees. This suggests that not all flowers developed in response to bees' vision, which supports the statement.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. This does not provide evidence that flowers did not develop in response to bees' vision.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. This does not provide evidence that flowers did not develop in response to bees' vision.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. This does not provide evidence that flowers did not develop in response to bees' vision.
Thought: 
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, it suggests that not all flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  Therefore, B most strongly supports the statement above.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  A: The fact that many insects that have vision similar to bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color is not relevant to the statement.
  B: If some flowers rely on insects other than bees, it would weaken the argument that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  C: The number of different species of flowers being greater than the number of different species of bees is not relevant to the statement.
  D: The fact that many nonflowering plants rely on bees is not relevant to the statement.
  E: The fact that present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food is not relevant to the statement.
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  If there is evidence that flowers have evolved specifically to attract bees, then this would support the statement.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees.
Criticism:
  The answer is not clear-cut, as it could be argued that some flowers have evolved to attract other insects in addition to bees, rather than in response to bees' vision specifically.
  However, the fact that some flowers rely on insects other than bees does suggest that flowers did not evolve solely to attract bees, which supports the statement.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument presents a dilemma between a healthy diet and the extinction of marine species.
  A: The argument presents a dilemma between the effectiveness and safety of vitamin E supplements.
  B: The argument presents a dilemma between the benefits of taxing tobacco and the potential reduction in funding for education.
  C: The argument presents a dilemma between individual financial security and the stability of the economy.
  D: The argument presents a dilemma between the time spent campaigning and the ability to do the job for which legislators were elected.
  E: The argument presents a dilemma between preserving wilderness areas and reducing the proliferation of certain species.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a situation where a healthy diet based on fish would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  If everyone adopted such a diet, it would be impossible to maintain it.
  Therefore, universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
  Option C presents a similar situation where individual financial security would lead to a recession if everyone adopted the same spending pattern.
  Therefore, universal adoption of such a spending pattern should not be recommended.
  Option C is the best answer.
Criticism: 
  The argument could be interpreted as a false dilemma, as there may be other ways to maintain a healthy diet without leading to the extinction of marine species.
  Option E may also be a valid answer, as it presents a similar dilemma between preserving wilderness areas and reducing the proliferation of certain species.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that a fish-based diet is healthier than a red meat-based diet, but if everyone adopted this diet, it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a conflict between two desirable outcomes: a healthy diet and the preservation of marine species. It argues that the latter is more important, and therefore, universal adoption of the former should not be recommended.
  Looking at the choices, option C presents a similar conflict between two desirable outcomes: individual financial security and economic stability. It argues that the latter is more important, and therefore, the recommended spending pattern should not be universalized.
Criticism: 
  The reasoning in option C is not entirely similar to the reasoning in the argument above. The argument above is about a conflict between two desirable outcomes, one of which is more important. Option C is about a desirable outcome that is not feasible for everyone to adopt because it would lead to an undesirable outcome.
Action: Answer("C")

The argument is about a trade-off between health and the environment.
Therefore, the reasoning in option E most closely resembles the argument above.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat, but if everyone adopted this diet, it would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible. Therefore, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a situation where a particular action is desirable but cannot be universally adopted because it would lead to negative consequences. 
  A: The argument presents a situation where a particular action is desirable but cannot be universally adopted because it may not be safe for all people. This is not similar to the argument above.
  B: The argument presents a situation where a particular action is desirable but cannot be universally adopted because it would reduce the funding generated for education. This is not similar to the argument above.
  C: The argument presents a situation where a particular action is desirable but cannot be universally adopted because it would throw the economy into a severe recession. This is not similar to the argument above.
  D: The argument presents a situation where a particular action is desirable but cannot be universally adopted because it would lead to negative consequences (not getting reelected). However, this is not similar to the argument above because the negative consequences are not related to the action itself.
  E: The argument presents a situation where a particular action is desirable but cannot be universally adopted because it would lead to negative consequences (reducing the proliferation of species that flourish in developed areas). This is similar to the argument above where the desirable action (adopting a healthier diet) cannot be universally adopted because it would lead to negative consequences (extinction of marine species).

Thought: 
  The argument presents a dilemma between two options: a healthy diet and the preservation of marine species. 
  It argues that the universal adoption of a fish-based diet would lead to the extinction of marine species, which would be undesirable. 
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
  The reasoning in option C is similar because it also presents a dilemma between two options: individual consumer well-being and the overall health of the economy. 
  It argues that if everyone limited their purchases to what they truly needed, it would lead to a severe recession, which would be undesirable. 
  Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  The reasoning in option A is not similar because it presents a concern about the safety of vitamin E supplements, not a dilemma between two options.
  The reasoning in option B is not similar because it presents a concern about the potential reduction in funding for education, not a dilemma between two options.
  The reasoning in option D is not similar because it presents an explanation for why legislators spend so much time campaigning, not a dilemma between two options.
  The reasoning in option E is not similar because it presents a trade-off between preserving wilderness areas and reducing the proliferation of certain species, not a dilemma between two options.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace that are not being addressed.
  A: The argument is about how different people react to substances, and that moderation is not a useful concept because of biological differences.
  B: The argument is about banning a device because it causes cancer in laboratory animals, but not all chemicals that cause cancer are banned.
  C: The argument is about the need for Acme to hire new employees because 1,000 employees are expected to retire.
  D: The argument is about the relationship between engaging characters and the success of a novel or story.
  E: The argument is about how success in the movie industry is judged based on profit relative to cost.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace that are not being addressed.
  The argument is that the company's reasoning for installing website filtering software is flawed because it does not address all distractions in the workplace.
  Therefore, the argument that is most similar in reasoning is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  The argument is that the emphasis on engaging characters is not enough to guarantee success because other elements are also important.
Criticism: 
  The argument is not about the success of engaging characters, but rather the idea that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace.
  Therefore, the answer may not be D.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not a good way to increase productivity because other things in the office can be just as distracting.
  A: The argument is about how people react differently to substances, and therefore moderation is not a good way to talk about how much of a substance is safe.
  B: The argument is about how banning a device because it causes cancer in laboratory animals is not a good idea because many chemicals cause cancer in high doses, but we don't ban them all.
  C: The argument is about how Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because 1,000 employees will retire.
  D: The argument is about how creating engaging characters does not guarantee a book or story will sell because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: The argument is about how judging a film's success based on its profit relative to its cost is misguided because an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not a good way to increase productivity because other things in the office can be just as distracting.
  The argument is that just because something is distracting, it doesn't mean it should be banned or filtered.
  Therefore, the argument that is most similar in its reasoning is D: creating engaging characters does not guarantee a book or story will sell because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  Just because a book has engaging characters, it doesn't mean it will sell.
  Just because something is distracting, it doesn't mean it should be banned or filtered.
  The answer is D: creating engaging characters does not guarantee a book or story will sell because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
Criticism: 
  The argument in D is not quite similar enough to the employee's argument. 
  The argument in D is about how creating engaging characters does not guarantee a book or story will sell because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  The employee's argument is about how website filtering software is not a good way to increase productivity because other things in the office can be just as distracting.
  A better answer might be E: judging a film's success based on its profit relative to its cost is misguided because an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie.
  Just because a movie is expensive, it doesn't mean it will be more successful.
  Just because something is distracting, it doesn't mean it should be banned or filtered.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not a solution to increasing productivity because other factors, such as office environment, can also be distracting.
  A: The argument is that moderation is not a useful concept because people react differently to substances.
  B: The argument is that banning a device based on laboratory animal studies is not justified because most chemicals can cause cancer in high doses.
  C: The argument is that Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because 1,000 employees are expected to retire.
  D: The argument is that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale in the creative writing industry.
  E: The argument is that judging a film's success based on profit relative to cost is misguided.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not a solution to increasing productivity because other factors, such as office environment, can also be distracting.
  A argues that moderation is not a useful concept because people react differently to substances.
  Both arguments are based on the idea that a one-size-fits-all approach is not effective.
  Therefore, A is the most similar argument to the employee's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  A: The argument is about moderation and how it fails to account for biological differences.
  B: The argument is about banning a device due to its potential harm, but not banning other chemicals that may also be harmful.
  C: The argument is about the need for Acme to hire new employees due to the retirement of current employees.
  D: The argument is about the importance of engaging characters in creative writing, but how that does not guarantee success in publishing.
  E: The argument is about how the movie industry judges success based on profit relative to cost, which may not be the best criterion.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  The argument is that if the company is concerned about distractions, it should block all potential distractions, not just some.
  Therefore, the argument is similar to the one in D: engaging characters are important, but not the only factor in publishing success.
  Just as engaging characters do not guarantee success, blocking some distractions but not others does not guarantee productivity.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as windows and decorations, are not blocked.
  A: This argument is about moderation and how it may not be appropriate for everyone due to biological differences.
  B: This argument is about banning a device due to its potential to cause cancer in laboratory animals, but not banning other chemicals that can also cause cancer in high doses.
  C: This argument is about the need for Acme to hire new employees to replace the ones who are retiring.
  D: This argument is about the misconception that engaging characters guarantee a successful novel or story.
  E: This argument is about the flawed criterion of judging a movie's success based on its profit relative to its cost.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as windows and decorations, are not blocked.
  The argument in (D) is similar because it argues against a common misconception, just like the employee argues against the company's claim that website filtering software is necessary.
  Therefore, (D) is the most similar argument in its reasoning to the employee's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to increase productivity because other distractions exist in the workplace that are not controlled.
  A: The argument is that moderation is not a useful concept because people have different biological reactions to substances.
  B: The argument is that banning an electronic device due to its potential to cause cancer in laboratory animals is not reasonable because many chemicals can cause cancer in high doses.
  C: The argument is that Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire.
  D: The argument is that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale of a novel or story because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that focus solely on character development.
  E: The argument is that judging a film's success based on profit relative to cost is misguided because it does not take into account other factors that contribute to a film's success.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to increase productivity because other distractions exist in the workplace that are not controlled.
  The argument is that just because one factor can be controlled, it does not mean that it is the most important factor in increasing productivity.
  Therefore, the argument is similar to D: creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale of a novel or story because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that focus solely on character development.
  Just because one element is present, it does not mean that it is the most important factor in determining success.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as windows and decorations, are not banned.
  A: The argument is that moderation is not a useful concept because people have different biological differences.
  B: The argument is that banning an electronic device because it causes cancer in laboratory animals is not reasonable because most chemicals can cause cancer in high doses.
  C: The argument is that Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because 1,000 employees are expected to retire.
  D: The argument is that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: The argument is that judging a film's success based on profit relative to cost is misguided because an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as windows and decorations, are not banned.
  The argument is that if website filtering software is banned, then other distractions should also be banned.
  Therefore, the employee's argument is most similar in reasoning to D: creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  The argument is that just because engaging characters are important, it does not guarantee a sale.
  Similarly, just because non-work-related websites are distracting, it does not mean that they should be banned.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to increase productivity because other distractions exist that are not filtered.
  A: The argument is about moderation and how it does not take into account biological differences.
  B: The argument is about banning a device due to its potential harm, but most chemicals cause cancer in high doses and are not banned.
  C: The argument is about the need for Acme to hire new employees to replace those who are retiring.
  D: The argument is about the relationship between engaging characters and the success of a novel or story.
  E: The argument is about how the movie industry judges a film's success.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary to increase productivity because other distractions exist that are not filtered.
  The argument is that the company's reasoning is flawed because it only addresses one type of distraction.
  Therefore, the most similar argument would be one that points out a flaw in reasoning due to a narrow focus.
  The argument in D is similar because it points out that publishers and agents reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements, indicating that a narrow focus is not enough to guarantee success.
  Therefore, the answer is D.
Criticism: 
  The argument in D is similar to the employee's argument in that it points out a flaw in reasoning due to a narrow focus, but it is not the most similar argument.
  The argument in E is more similar because it also points out a flaw in reasoning due to a narrow focus on a single criterion for success.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not banned.
  A: The argument is about moderation and how it fails to take into account biological differences.
  B: The argument is about banning a device that causes cancer in laboratory animals, but not banning other chemicals that also cause cancer in high doses.
  C: The argument is about the need for Acme to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year because 1,000 employees are expected to retire.
  D: The argument is about the misconception that engaging characters guarantee a sale in the creative writing industry.
  E: The argument is about the misguided criterion of judging a film's success based on its profit relative to its cost.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not banned.
  The argument is that if the company is going to ban one type of distraction, it should ban all types of distractions.
  Therefore, the argument is most similar to D: the argument that engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the creative writing industry.
  Just as engaging characters do not guarantee a sale, banning non-work-related websites does not guarantee better work.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  A: The argument is about how people react differently to substances and that moderation is not a useful concept because of biological differences.
  B: The argument is about how banning a device due to cancer risks is not reasonable because most chemicals cause cancer in high doses.
  C: The argument is about how Acme needs to hire 1,000 people because 1,000 employees are retiring.
  D: The argument is about how engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the publishing industry.
  E: The argument is about how a movie's success should not be judged solely on its profit relative to its cost.
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not blocked.
  The argument is that if website filtering software is necessary to prevent distractions, then other distractions should also be blocked.
  Therefore, the argument is most similar to D: engaging characters do not guarantee a sale in the publishing industry.
  The argument is that if engaging characters were the only requirement for a successful novel, then all novels with engaging characters would sell, which is not the case.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
Criticism: 
  The argument could also be similar to E: a movie's success should not be judged solely on its profit relative to its cost.
  The argument is that if profit relative to cost were the only requirement for a successful movie, then all expensive movies that sold as many tickets as lower-budget movies would be more successful, which is not the case.
  Therefore, the answer could also be E.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

  Choice A suggests that the blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available. This supports the finding of the study that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the finding of the study.
  Choice C suggests that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities. This does not explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the finding of the study.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the finding of the study.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want.
  A recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Thought:
  The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  The study result suggests that smokers are getting the same amount of nicotine regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes they smoke.
  To explain the finding of the nicotine study, we need to find an option that supports the idea that smokers get the same amount of nicotine regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes they smoke.
  Option A does not explain the finding of the nicotine study because it talks about the maximum amount of nicotine that blood can absorb, which is not relevant to the study's finding.
  Option B does not explain the finding of the nicotine study because it talks about the behavior of smokers, which is not relevant to the study's finding.
  Option D does not explain the finding of the nicotine study because it talks about the level of tar in cigarettes, which is not relevant to the study's finding.
  Option E does not explain the finding of the nicotine study because it talks about the decrease in nicotine level when smoking is discontinued, which is not relevant to the study's finding.
  Option C explains the finding of the nicotine study because it suggests that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities. This means that smokers get the same amount of nicotine regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes they smoke.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  A: Blood absorption of nicotine is limited.
  B: Smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes may smoke more cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine as high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: Tar levels in low-nicotine cigarettes are higher than some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When smoking is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.
Thought:
  The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  Option A suggests that blood absorption of nicotine is limited, which could help explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers are identical, regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes they smoke.
  Option B suggests that smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes may smoke more cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine as high-nicotine cigarettes, which could help explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers are identical, regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes they smoke.
  Option C suggests that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities, which could help explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers are identical, regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes they smoke.
  Option D suggests that tar levels in low-nicotine cigarettes are higher than some high-nicotine cigarettes, which is not relevant to the study's findings.
  Option E suggests that when smoking is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily, which is not relevant to the study's findings.
  Therefore, the most helpful option to explain the study's findings is C: most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: If grain prices double then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The phenomenon described is that if grain prices double, the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
- A: Talks about reducing labor costs in the production and sale of beef.
- B: Compares the wholesale price per pound of beef to the wholesale price per pound of bread.
- C: Compares the cost of producing bread to the cost of producing beef.
- D: Compares the proportion of beef produced from cattle fed on grass to the proportion produced from grain-fed cattle.
- E: Compares the sources of bread and meat sold in retail grocery outlets.
Thought:
- The phenomenon described suggests that the cost of grain is a significant factor in the cost of producing beef, but not in the cost of producing bread.
- Option B, which compares the wholesale price per pound of beef to the wholesale price per pound of bread, does not explain why the price of beef is affected more than the price of bread.
- Option C, which compares the cost of producing bread to the cost of producing beef, does not explain why the price of beef is affected more than the price of bread.
- Option D, which compares the proportion of beef produced from cattle fed on grass to the proportion produced from grain-fed cattle, is not relevant to the phenomenon described.
- Option E, which compares the sources of bread and meat sold in retail grocery outlets, is not relevant to the phenomenon described.
- Option A, which talks about reducing labor costs in the production and sale of beef, does not explain why the price of beef is affected more than the price of bread.
- Therefore, none of the options seem to contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described.
- However, if we assume that the cost of grain is a significant factor in the cost of producing beef, then the most likely explanation is that beef requires more grain per pound than bread does, which would make beef more sensitive to changes in grain prices.
- Therefore, the best answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Grain prices doubling causes the average price of a loaf of bread to rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Grain-fed beef prices come close to doubling.
  A: The labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef are reduced by farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Thought: 
  Grain prices doubling causes the price of bread to rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef comes close to doubling.
  Option A is not relevant to the phenomenon described above.
  Option B is not relevant to the phenomenon described above.
  Option C explains why the price of bread does not come close to doubling, but it does not explain why the price of grain-fed beef comes close to doubling.
  Option D is not relevant to the phenomenon described above.
  Option E is not relevant to the phenomenon described above.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.
  Option C explains why the price of bread does not come close to doubling, but it does not explain why the price of grain-fed beef comes close to doubling.
  However, the question asks for the option that would most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above, and option C does contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Grain prices doubling will affect the price of bread and beef.
  The price of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  The price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
A: Farmers reducing labor costs in beef production does not explain the phenomenon of grain prices affecting beef and bread prices.
B: The wholesale price per pound of beef being ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread does not explain the phenomenon of grain prices affecting beef and bread prices.
C: The cost of producing bread is mostly labor and marketing costs, while the cost of producing beef is mostly the cost of feeding cattle. This information helps explain why the price of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
D: The proportion of beef sold in retail markets produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain does not explain the phenomenon of grain prices affecting beef and bread prices.
E: The fact that retail grocery outlets purchase bread from small independent bakers but purchase meat from large wholesale processing operations does not explain the phenomenon of grain prices affecting beef and bread prices.
Thought:
  The cost of producing bread is mostly labor and marketing costs, while the cost of producing beef is mostly the cost of feeding cattle.
  Therefore, when grain prices double, the cost of feeding cattle increases, which significantly increases the cost of producing beef.
  However, the cost of producing bread is not significantly affected by the cost of grain, so the price of bread only increases by 10 to 15 percent.
  Therefore, C is the most likely answer to explain the phenomenon described above.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double.
  The price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling if grain prices double.
  A: The labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef may be reduced by farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production, but it is not clear how this would contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread, but it is not clear how this would contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef. This could explain why the price of bread would rise by a smaller percentage than the price of beef if grain prices double.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain, but it is not clear how this would contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations, but it is not clear how this would contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above.
Thought:
  If the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef, then it makes sense that the price of beef would increase by a larger percentage than the price of bread if grain prices double.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct.

Thought:
  The phenomenon described in the statement is that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling if grain prices double, whereas the price of bread will only rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  The correct answer should explain why the price of grain-fed beef is more sensitive to grain prices than the price of bread.
  Option B is not relevant because it only compares the wholesale price per pound of beef and bread.
  Option A is not relevant because it only talks about labor costs and not about the cost of feed.
  Option C is not relevant because it only talks about the cost of producing bread and beef, but not about how they are affected by grain prices.
  Option D is not relevant because it only talks about the proportion of beef sold in retail markets that is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  Option E is not relevant because it only talks about where retail grocery outlets purchase the bread and meat they sell.
  None of the options explain why the price of grain-fed beef is more sensitive to grain prices than the price of bread.
Criticism:
  The thought process is correct, but it is incomplete. 
  The correct answer is that the cost of feed represents a much larger proportion of the cost of producing beef than the cost of producing bread.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.

  To strengthen this argument, we need to find a statement that supports the idea that lichens are a cheaper and equally effective alternative to mechanical monitoring devices.
  A: This statement does not provide any information that strengthens the researcher's argument.
  B: This statement supports the idea that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales, which strengthens the researcher's argument that lichens can be used to monitor air pollution.
  C: This statement weakens the researcher's argument because it suggests that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal, which is not the case in the researcher's study.
  D: This statement does not provide any information that strengthens the researcher's argument.
  E: This statement strengthens the researcher's argument by suggesting that lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper, which supports the idea that lichens can be used to monitor air pollution.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Criticism:
  There is no criticism to this answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The researcher suggests that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  The researcher harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices.
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem is irrelevant to the argument.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales is relevant to the argument.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal is irrelevant to the argument.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories is irrelevant to the argument.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper is relevant to the argument.
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is that lichens can replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
  The researcher compared the results of copper concentration in lichens with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices.
  Choice B strengthens the argument by stating that copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales, which means that lichens can be used to monitor air pollution in several areas.
  Choice E also strengthens the argument by stating that lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper, which means that lichens can be used to monitor other air pollutants as well.
  However, choice E is not as strong as choice B because copper is the pollutant that the researcher specifically studied.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion
  D: appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute
  E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  A: The effectiveness of antibiotics in treating stomach ulcers and tuberculosis is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The duration of tuberculosis and ulcers caused by H pylori is not relevant to the argument.
  C: The argument implies that commensal bacteria must provide some benefit to their hosts, so this option is relevant.
  D: The number of people who harbor M tuberculosis and H pylori is not relevant to the argument.
  E: The number of people who harbor M tuberculosis and H pylori is not relevant to the argument.
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  Option C undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the presence of M tuberculosis does not provide any benefit to its host, whereas H pylori allegedly strengthens immune response.
  If M tuberculosis does not provide any benefit to its host, then it cannot be considered a commensal.
  Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
Criticism:
  There is no flaw in the logic used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is about whether or not H pylori is a commensal.
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample to show that not all bacteria that do not cause disease can be considered commensals.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The counterexample used is M tuberculosis, which does not cause disease in most people but is not considered a commensal.
  If M tuberculosis does provide some benefit to people who harbor it, then it is possible that H pylori could also be a commensal even if it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  Therefore, if it is true that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive some benefit from its presence, then the argument's reasoning is seriously undermined.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Commensals are bacteria that benefit human beings who they are present in the body.
  Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers.
  Stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori.
  Mycobacter tuberculosis is a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis.
  Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response. 
  The argument then uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample, stating that only 10% of people who harbor it get sick, yet no one would call it a commensal. 
  This implies that the fact that only a small percentage of people get sick from a bacterium is not enough to classify it as a commensal. 
  Therefore, the argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts the argument's reasoning.
  A: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  B: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  C: This statement contradicts the argument's reasoning. If people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, then the fact that only 10% of people get sick from it is not enough to classify it as a commensal. 
  D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  E: This statement is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
Criticism: 
  The argument claims that the fact that only a small percentage of people get sick from a bacterium is not enough to classify it as a commensal. 
  However, this assumes that the bacterium provides some benefit to the host. 
  If a bacterium provides no benefit to the host, then the fact that only a small percentage of people get sick from it is not relevant to whether it should be classified as a commensal. 
  Therefore, the argument's reasoning is flawed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which also causes disease in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  A: The effectiveness of antibiotics in treating the diseases caused by H pylori and M tuberculosis is not relevant to the argument.
  B: The duration of the diseases caused by H pylori and M tuberculosis is not relevant to the argument.
  C: The argument implies that commensals provide some benefit to their hosts, so this statement is relevant to the argument.
  D: The number of people who harbor H pylori or M tuberculosis is not relevant to the argument.
  E: The number of people who harbor H pylori or M tuberculosis is not relevant to the argument.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which also causes disease in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  If M tuberculosis does provide some benefit to its hosts, then the comparison to H pylori is not valid.
  Therefore, if C is true, it would undermine the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Commensals are bacteria that benefit human beings who they are present in the body.
  Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers.
  Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis get sick from it.
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument uses the example of M tuberculosis to support its claim, stating that only 10% of people who harbor it get sick, yet no one would call it a commensal.
  The argument assumes that the only reason to consider a bacterium a commensal is if it does not cause disease in the majority of people who harbor it.
  Therefore, if there is another reason to consider a bacterium a commensal, the argument's reasoning would be undermined.
Evaluation:
  A: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning and is irrelevant.
  B: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning and is irrelevant.
  C: This statement provides an alternative reason to consider a bacterium a commensal, which undermines the argument's reasoning.
  D: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning and is irrelevant.
  E: This statement does not address the argument's reasoning and is irrelevant.
Action: Answer("C")

  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which also causes disease in some people but is not considered a commensal.
  The argument assumes that the only reason to consider a bacterium a commensal is if it does not cause disease in anyone who harbors it.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason to consider a bacterium a commensal is if it does not cause disease in anyone who harbors it.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument is about whether or not H pylori should be considered a commensal.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis.
  H pylori allegedly strengthens the immune response and causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of those who harbor it.
  M tuberculosis can cause tuberculosis, but only about 10% of those who harbor it get sick from it.
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of those who harbor it, even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response.
  The argument claims that M tuberculosis should not be considered a commensal even though only about 10% of those who harbor it get sick from it.
  The argument assumes that the low rate of illness caused by M tuberculosis is not due to any benefits conferred by the bacterium.
  Therefore, an option that shows that M tuberculosis is actually a commensal would undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Option C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which supports the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, option C is not the correct answer.
Criticism:
  The argument assumes that the low rate of illness caused by M tuberculosis is not due to any benefits conferred by the bacterium.
  However, this assumption may not be true.
  Therefore, an option that shows that M tuberculosis is actually a commensal would not necessarily undermine the argument's reasoning.

  The argument uses the example of M tuberculosis to support this claim, stating that only 10% of people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it, but no one would call it a commensal.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find an example where a bacterium that causes disease is still considered a commensal.
  Choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which supports the argument's claim that M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal.
  Therefore, choice C does not undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D and E are also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  None of the choices seriously undermines the argument's reasoning.

Thought: 
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers, even though only a small percentage of people who harbor it get ulcers.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis, but argues that no one would consider M tuberculosis a commensal even though only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick from it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that suggests that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed.
  Choice C suggests that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which could suggest that the comparison is flawed because H pylori allegedly strengthens immune response.

  The argument is about whether H pylori should be considered a commensal.
  H pylori can cause stomach ulcers, but only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick.
  M tuberculosis can cause tuberculosis, but only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick.
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it can cause stomach ulcers, even though only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick.
  The argument then claims that M tuberculosis should not be considered a commensal because it can cause tuberculosis, even though only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick.
  The argument assumes that the two cases are similar and that if one is not a commensal, then the other is not either.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a difference between the two cases that would make it reasonable to consider H pylori a commensal but not M tuberculosis.
  Choice C provides such a difference, by stating that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The question is asking which option, if true, would cast the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.
Thought: 
  The evidence offered is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  If the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, it would cast doubt on the validity of the evidence because it would suggest that the polar bear did not have a clear sense of direction.
  If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it would support the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  If the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, it would not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence because polar bears are adapted to living in such environments.
  If polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, it would not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence because it would suggest that the ability to navigate over considerable distances is not unique to polar bears.
  If polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, it would not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence because it would suggest that polar bears have multiple ways of finding their way home.
  Therefore, the option that would cast the most doubt on the validity of the evidence is A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. Option A would suggest that the polar bear did not have a clear sense of direction, which would cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.

  A: The fact that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  B: If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, then it is possible that the polar bear was able to find its way home using its memory of the route. This does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  C: The fact that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  D: The fact that other species of mammal have been known to find their way home from considerable distances does not necessarily cast doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  E: If polar bears rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, then the fact that the polar bear was able to find its way home after being released over 500 kilometers away casts doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

Thought: 
  The question asks which option casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, which could indicate that the bear was not using navigational abilities to return home.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, which could indicate that the bear was already familiar with the area and did not need to navigate.
  Option C suggests that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, which could indicate that the bear was using visual cues to navigate rather than innate abilities.
  Option D suggests that other species of mammal have also been known to find their way home from considerable distances, which could indicate that the polar bear's ability to navigate is not unique.
  Option E suggests that polar bears often rely on their sense of smell to navigate, which could indicate that the bear was not using innate navigational abilities to return home.
  Option A, B, C, and E all cast some doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods.
  In Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  However, the argument does not consider other factors that may contribute to colon cancer.
  For example, there may be other dietary or lifestyle factors that are different between Western and non-Western countries that could contribute to the higher colon cancer rates in Western countries.
  Therefore, the argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that there may be other factors that contribute to colon cancer.
  Among the given choices, B, D, and E are not relevant to the argument's reasoning.
  A and C are possible criticisms because they suggest that there may be other factors that affect the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
  However, A is not a strong criticism because even if fiber consumption is rising in many countries, it does not necessarily mean that fiber is being consumed in sufficient amounts to prevent colon cancer.
  C is a stronger criticism because it suggests that some people may not be able to consume enough fiber to prevent colon cancer, which would weaken the argument's claim that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence.
  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries than in non-Western countries where people eat more fiber-rich foods.

  The best answer is B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
Criticism:
  The journalist assumes that the document is complete and that every member of the trade group is listed.
  However, the journalist does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
  Therefore, answer choice B is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group.
  The trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.
  Bruch Industries is not listed on the document.
Thought:
  The journalist assumes that the document lists every member of the trade group.
  The journalist assumes that Bruch Industries would be listed on the document if it were a member of the trade group.
  The journalist does not provide any evidence to support these assumptions.
  Therefore, the journalist's reasoning is flawed.
  The best answer is B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group.
Criticism:
  The journalist's reasoning is indeed flawed.
  However, it is not accurate to say that the journalist assumes that Bruch Industries would be listed on the document if it were a member of the trade group.
  The journalist only concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group based on the fact that it is not listed on the document.
  Therefore, answer choice D is also flawed.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The journalist received a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies from a manufacturers' trade group.
  The representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document belongs to the trade group.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in the wild.
  The likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild, yet they have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy as those in the wild. 
  Therefore, there must be some other factor that is helping captive leatherbacks reach their maximum life expectancy.
  Option A, B, C, D, and E do not provide a clear explanation for the apparent discrepancy.
  However, option C suggests that the main cause of death for leatherbacks in the wild is predation, which means that they are not dying from diseases as much as they are being killed by predators.
  Therefore, it is possible that the diseases that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to are not as fatal as predation in the wild, which could explain why they have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  Thus, option C most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have about the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
Thought: 
  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity suggests that they would have a lower likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity than in the wild.
  However, the passage states that the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is about the same in captivity and in the wild.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between the susceptibility to fatal diseases and the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the susceptibility to fatal diseases does not affect the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
  Choice C provides a possible explanation: most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators. This suggests that the fatal diseases that leatherbacks are susceptible to in captivity are not as significant a threat in the wild, where predators are a more common cause of death.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks are the largest of the sea turtles.
  They are susceptible to fatal diseases when subjected to captivity.
  The likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases when subjected to captivity, but they still have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy whether they are in captivity or in the wild. 
  This suggests that there is something about captivity that is offsetting the negative effects of disease.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why leatherbacks in captivity are still able to reach their maximum life expectancy despite being susceptible to fatal diseases.
  Option C provides a possible explanation for this discrepancy. If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then it is possible that leatherbacks in captivity are able to avoid these predators, which would increase their chances of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
Criticism: 
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D is not helpful in resolving the discrepancy.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy.
Thought: 
  Leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases, but they have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  There must be some other factor that is helping captive leatherbacks to reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find the factor that is helping captive leatherbacks to reach their theoretical maximum life expectancy.
  Choice A, B, C, D, and E do not provide any information that can help to resolve the discrepancy.
  Therefore, none of the options help to resolve the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases when in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild.
Thought:
  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases when in captivity and have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild seems contradictory.
  Therefore, we need to find a statement that resolves this contradiction.
  Option A is irrelevant to the contradiction.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the contradiction.
  Option C does not explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the contradiction.
  Option E does not explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  None of the options seem to resolve the contradiction.
Criticism:
  The correct answer should explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  None of the options provide a satisfactory explanation.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have a similar likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
Thought:
  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity suggests that they would have a lower likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity.
  However, the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is similar in captivity and in the wild.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between these two facts.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why leatherbacks are not more likely to die in captivity.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not explain why leatherbacks have a similar likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it does not explain why leatherbacks have a similar likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it does not explain why leatherbacks have a similar likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it does not explain why leatherbacks have a similar likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  Choice E could help resolve the discrepancy if it turns out that the size of a leatherback is a reliable indicator of its age and that the size of a captive leatherback is similar to that of a wild leatherback of the same age.
  If that were the case, then the similar likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild could be explained by the fact that captive leatherbacks are not actually older than wild leatherbacks of the same size.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
Thought:
  The paradox is that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
  To resolve the paradox, we need to find an answer that explains how leatherbacks can have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild despite being susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  A: This answer choice does not help resolve the paradox because it does not explain how leatherbacks can have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild despite being susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  B: This answer choice does not help resolve the paradox because it does not explain how leatherbacks can have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild despite being susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  C: This answer choice does not help resolve the paradox because it does not explain how leatherbacks can have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild despite being susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
Thought: 
  The fact that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity suggests that they would not live as long in captivity as they would in the wild.
  However, the fact that leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild suggests that captivity does not have a negative impact on their lifespan.
  Therefore, there must be some other factor that is compensating for the negative impact of captivity on their health.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer choice that provides a plausible explanation for why leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity and in the wild.
Evaluation: 
  A: This answer choice is irrelevant to the discrepancy.
  B: This answer choice is also irrelevant to the discrepancy.

Most of the new shows they produced last season were canceled due to insufficient viewership. Furthermore, their new shows are all police dramas, and few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to strengthen the argument?
Choices:
  A: Wilke & Wilke have produced more new shows for this season than they produced last season.
  B: Most of the shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year were police dramas.
  C: None of the shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were not canceled were police dramas.

  The new shows they produced this season are all police dramas.
  Few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
Thought: 
  The argument is that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produce for this season will be canceled because most of the new shows they produced last season were canceled due to insufficient viewership and few police dramas have been popular in recent years. 
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the new police dramas produced by Wilke & Wilke are unlikely to be popular.
  Option A is irrelevant because the number of new shows produced this season does not affect the popularity of the shows.
  Option B is also irrelevant because it does not provide any information about the popularity of the shows.
  Option C is also irrelevant because it only talks about the shows that were not canceled, not the ones that were canceled due to insufficient viewership.
  Option D is the correct answer because it supports the argument that police dramas are unlikely to be popular. If all of the new shows that were canceled last year were police dramas, it suggests that police dramas are not popular.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it only talks about the most popular television shows last year, not about police dramas.
Criticism: 
  The correct answer is D because it supports the argument that police dramas are unlikely to be popular. However, it is possible that the new police dramas produced by Wilke & Wilke are different from the ones produced last year and may be more popular.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: History provides many examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable. This shows that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: People correctly believe that technological innovations often cause job loss.
  B: People are often reluctant to take on new challenges.
  C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
  D: People tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations.
  E: People correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
Thought:
  The argument claims that people resist technological innovations because of social inertia, not because they desire comfort or safety.
  The reasoning assumes that social inertia is the only reason people resist technological innovations.
  If there is another reason, then the argument is weakened.
  A: This choice provides a reason why people might resist technological innovations that is not related to social inertia. However, it does not necessarily undermine the argument.
  B: This choice provides a reason why people might resist technological innovations that is not related to social inertia. However, it does not necessarily undermine the argument.
  C: This choice provides evidence that contradicts the argument. If some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, then social inertia might not be the only reason people resist technological innovations.
  D: This choice provides a reason why people might not resist technological innovations. However, it does not necessarily undermine the argument.
  E: This choice provides a reason why people might embrace technological innovations. However, it does not necessarily undermine the argument.
Criticism: 
  Choice C contradicts the argument by providing evidence that workers have embraced some technological innovations. This suggests that social inertia might not be the only reason people resist technological innovations.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
Thought:
  The argument is based on the premise that people resist technological innovations because they are used to their current working conditions, even if those conditions are miserable.
  If there are examples of workers embracing technological innovations, then the argument is weakened because it shows that people are not always resistant to change.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
Thought:
  The argument claims that people resist technological innovations because of social inertia, not because of the desire for comfort or safety.
  If people resist technological innovations for other reasons, then the argument is weakened.
  A: This may be a reason why people resist technological innovations, but it does not undermine the argument that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
  B: This may be a reason why people resist technological innovations, but it does not undermine the argument that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
  C: This weakens the argument because it shows that the claim that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior is not always true.
  D: This may be true, but it does not undermine the argument that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
  E: This may be a reason why people resist technological innovations, but it does not undermine the argument that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior.
Criticism: 
  The argument is based on the assumption that people resist technological innovations because of social inertia, not because of other reasons.
  However, the argument does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
Thought:
  The argument is based on the premise that people resist technological innovations even when those innovations would improve their working conditions.
  The reasoning is that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find an option that suggests that people are not as resistant to technological innovations as the argument suggests.
  Option C suggests that some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
  If this is true, then it weakens the argument's claim that social inertia is the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
Thought:
  The argument is based on the premise that technological innovations are strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable.
  The argument concludes that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts one of the premises or the conclusion.
  A: This statement does not contradict the argument. It is possible that people resist technological innovations because they believe that such innovations cause job loss.
  B: This statement does not contradict the argument. It is possible that people are reluctant to take on new challenges.
  C: This statement weakens the argument. If some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, then social inertia may not be the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
  D: This statement weakens the argument. If people tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations, then social inertia may not be the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
  E: This statement does not contradict the argument. It is possible that people resist technological innovations even if they believe that such innovations increase workers' productivity.
  The most serious undermining statement is either C or D.
Criticism:
  The argument assumes that all technological innovations are resisted by workers, which is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:

- Choice B suggests that people resist technological innovations because of a reluctance to take on new challenges, not social inertia. This weakens the argument.
- Choice C suggests that some workers embrace technological innovations, which weakens the argument that social inertia is the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
- Choice D suggests that people adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations, which weakens the argument that social inertia is the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
- Choice E suggests that people resist technological innovations because they believe it will increase their productivity, not because of social inertia. This weakens the argument.
Criticism:
- None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
Thought:
  The argument is based on the premise that people resist technological innovations because they are resistant to change.

  C: If some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, then the argument is weakened because it shows that social inertia is not always the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
Criticism:
  A: This statement does not necessarily undermine the argument because it does not address the issue of social inertia.
  B: This statement does not necessarily undermine the argument because it does not address the issue of social inertia.
  D: This statement does not necessarily undermine the argument because it does not address the issue of social inertia.
  E: This statement does not necessarily undermine the argument because it does not address the issue of social inertia.

Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than the desire for comfort or safety.
Thought:
  The argument claims that technological innovations are strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable. 
  The argument concludes that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find an option that suggests that social inertia is not the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
  A: This option suggests that people resist technological innovations because they believe it causes job loss. This does not undermine the argument that social inertia is a powerful determinant of human behavior.
  B: This option suggests that people are often reluctant to take on new challenges. This does not undermine the argument that social inertia is a powerful determinant of human behavior.
  C: This option suggests that some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers. This weakens the argument that social inertia is the most powerful determinant of human behavior.
  D: This option suggests that people tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations. This weakens the argument that social inertia is the most powerful determinant of human behavior.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well

Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero" already dominates the market in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are accurate and that they reflect the actual sales figures.
  The argument also assumes that Harrold Foods will maintain its current market share.
  However, the argument fails to consider other factors that could affect the market share of "Hero," such as the introduction of new products or changes in consumer preferences.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The fact that "Hero" currently dominates the market does not guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future.

  Survey results show that 72% of all consumers believe "Hero" dominates the market.
  Any product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is dominant in that market.
Thought: 
  Harrold Foods dominates the market because "Hero" already dominates the market according to the survey results.
  Any product with more than 50% of the sales in a market is dominant in that market.
  Therefore, Harrold Foods need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to dominate the market.
  The argument seems valid.
Criticism: 
  The argument is committing the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result. 
  The survey results show that 72% of all consumers believe "Hero" dominates the market. This is not the same as having more than 50% of the sales in the market.

Thought: 
  The argument states that Harrold Foods already dominates the market because "Hero" is the most popular carbonated drink and 72% of all consumers believe it dominates the market.
  However, the argument fails to consider the possibility that other companies may also be promoting their products to dominate the market.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
- Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Thought:
- The journalist states that brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- The journalist explains that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- The journalist explains that brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so their lithium cannot be consumed.
- Therefore, a celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere must have a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements, and any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is not a star with less mass than the Sun.

Evaluation:
- Choice A is incorrect because the journalist only stated that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, but did not say that any celestial object without lithium is a star with less mass than the Sun.
- Choice B is the most strongly supported by the journalist's statements because the journalist explained that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete, and that a brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
- Choice C is incorrect because the journalist did not say that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
- Choice D is incorrect because the journalist did not say that no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
- Choice E is incorrect because the journalist did not say that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.

- The journalist states that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- The journalist also states that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- The journalist states that brown dwarfs do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so their lithium cannot be consumed.
- Therefore, any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere must have a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements, and any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere cannot be a star at least as massive as the Sun or a brown dwarf.

Criticism:
- The journalist's statements do not support the idea that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
- The journalist's statements do not support the idea that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
- The journalist's statements do not support the idea that no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.

Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
- Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
- Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
- Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
- A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

Thought:
- The journalist's statements suggest that lithium is a useful indicator of a celestial object's mass and whether or not it is a star or a brown dwarf.
- The journalist states that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because their nuclear furnaces are incomplete.
- The journalist also states that brown dwarfs do not have fully functional nuclear furnaces and so their lithium cannot be consumed.
- Therefore, it can be inferred that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
- It cannot be inferred that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun, as there may be other reasons why a celestial object does not have lithium in its atmosphere.
- It also cannot be inferred that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf, as there may be other ways to identify brown dwarfs.
- Similarly, it cannot be inferred that no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun, as there may be other ways to identify such objects.
- Finally, it cannot be inferred that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere, as there may be other types of objects that have lithium in their atmospheres.

Criticism:
- The journalist's statements are generally accurate, but some of the inferences drawn from them may be too strong or too narrow.
- It is possible that there are other ways to identify celestial objects besides their mass and lithium content.
- It is also possible that there are other factors that affect the presence or absence of lithium in a celestial object's atmosphere.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.

  The argument above states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, the inflation rate increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  This is similar to option C, which states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time, so the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  Both arguments make a conditional statement that if one thing happened, then another thing would have happened. However, because the expected outcome did not occur, the argument concludes that the initial condition did not occur either.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument above most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in option C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, inflation rate would have lessened. However, since the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  A: The argument states that if the valley people were invaded or there was a climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture. But since the architecture remained the same, the valley people must not have been invaded.
  B: The argument states that if the opposition party wins the election and cuts wages, workers in key industries will strike. But since the workers have promised not to strike, they must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: The argument states that if the company had sold its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time, so the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: The argument states that if the rebels won the battle and the jailed rebel leaders were freed, city residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels. Residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days, so the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: The argument states that if the television station's new weather forecasting equipment was worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased, so the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Thought: 
  The argument presents a hypothetical situation that did not occur and concludes that the economic theories were off the mark. 
  Option A presents a hypothetical situation that did not occur and concludes that the valley people were not invaded. 
  Option B presents a hypothetical situation that may not occur and concludes that the workers do not believe the party will keep its promise. 
  Option C presents a hypothetical situation that did not occur and concludes that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries. 
  Option D presents a hypothetical situation that may not occur and concludes that the rebels won the battle. 
  Option E presents a hypothetical situation that did not occur and concludes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
  Option A and Option C are similar to the argument above in that they present a hypothetical situation that did not occur and draw a conclusion based on that hypothetical situation.
  However, Option A is a flawed reasoning of causality, while Option C is a flawed reasoning of necessary and sufficient conditions.
  Option B and Option D are not similar to the argument above because they present a hypothetical situation that may not occur.
  Option E is not similar to the argument above because it presents a hypothetical situation that did not occur and draws a conclusion based on that hypothetical situation.
Criticism: 
  The argument presents a hypothetical situation that did not occur and draws a conclusion based on that hypothetical situation. However, the argument does not provide any evidence to support the hypothetical situation presented.

  B: The argument suggests that because workers have promised not to strike, they must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: The argument suggests that because the price of the stock did not increase, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: The argument suggests that because city residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: The argument suggests that because the station's ratings actually decreased, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Thought: 
  The argument above suggests that because the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
  This is a flawed reasoning because there could be other factors that caused the inflation rate to increase.
  Similarly, in option C, the argument suggests that because the price of the stock did not increase, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  This is a flawed reasoning because there could be other factors that caused the stock price to remain the same.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in option C most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
  The answer is C.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct. 
  The argument in option C is flawed because it assumes that the only reason the stock price did not increase is that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  There could be other reasons why the stock price did not increase.
  Therefore, the answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:

  This is flawed reasoning because it assumes that the only reason the inflation rate increased was that the party's economic theories were flawed. There could be other factors that contributed to the increase in inflation rate.
  Therefore, the argument that most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above is C: The argument states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This is flawed reasoning because it assumes that the only reason the stock price did not increase was that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries. There could be other factors that contributed to the stock price not increasing.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. The argument in option C is flawed because it assumes that the only reason the stock price did not increase was that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries. There could be other factors that contributed to the stock price not increasing. 
  However, the argument in the question stem is flawed because it assumes that the only reason the inflation rate increased was that the party's economic theories were flawed. There could be other factors that contributed to the increase in inflation rate.

  Choice A presents a conditional statement that if the valley people were invaded or there was a climatic change, there would have been changes in the valley's architecture. However, the architecture remained the same throughout their stay. Therefore, the valley people must not have been invaded. This is similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
Criticism: 
  The reasoning in choice B is flawed because it assumes that the workers' promise not to strike is based on their belief that the opposition party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that wetland development should be regulated in order to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that wetland development is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources and that wetland development is necessary for growth.
  Therefore, a principle that supports the idea that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice D states that environmental regulation cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. This principle supports the idea that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources without being subject to the same regulations as other nations that have already harmed the environment.
  Therefore, choice D would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.

  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate wetland development to protect wildlife and proposes the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that wetland development is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
  Therefore, a principle that supports a nation's right to govern its own resources would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  The only choice that supports a nation's right to govern its own resources is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Criticism: 
  Choice D does not explicitly support a nation's right to govern its own resources, but rather focuses on the principle of preventing further environmental damage.
  Choice E, which states that it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources, could also be interpreted as supporting the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that wetland development should be regulated in order to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that wetland development is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that wetland development is necessary for growth and that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
  Therefore, a principle that supports the idea that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice D states that environmental regulation cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. This principle supports the Figorian Development Commission's position because it suggests that Figoria should be allowed to develop its wetlands even if other nations have already harmed the environment.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Criticism: 
  None.

Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
  If we accept the principle that nations have the right to govern their own resources, then we should allow Figoria to develop wetlands for economic growth.
  Therefore, the principle that would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position is that nations have the right to govern their own resources.
  The answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Criticism:
  The principle in choice D does not necessarily support the Figorian Development Commission's position. 
  It is possible that the principle could support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position if it is interpreted to mean that Figoria should not be allowed to develop wetlands because other nations have already harmed the environment.
  Therefore, the correct answer may be None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:

Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources and that wetland development is necessary for growth.
  Therefore, a principle that supports the idea that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice D, which states that environmental regulation cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment, supports the Figorian Development Commission's position that Figoria should be allowed to develop its wetlands because other nations have already developed theirs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development should be regulated in Figoria to protect wildlife. They propose that future wetland development should be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth. They believe that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources.
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources. Therefore, a principle that supports the idea of national sovereignty over resources would most strongly support their position.
  A: This principle argues for international regulation of national resources when wildlife is endangered, which goes against the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  B: This principle argues that preserving wildlife is more important than economic needs, which goes against the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  C: This principle argues for regulation only after a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found, which is not relevant to the argument between the two commissions.
  D: This principle argues that environmental regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment, which goes against the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  E: This principle argues against allowing further depletion of natural resources, which is not relevant to the argument between the two commissions.
  Therefore, none of the principles strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Criticism: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources. However, the question asks for a principle that would most strongly support their position. None of the principles support their position strongly.

Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria has the right to govern its own resources and that wetland development is necessary for growth.
  Therefore, a principle that supports the right of nations to govern their own resources would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  The only choice that supports this principle is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Criticism: 
  The principle in choice D does not directly support the Figorian Development Commission's position that wetland development is necessary for growth.
  It is possible that another principle, such as the economic benefits of wetland development, would more strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development should be regulated to protect wildlife, and that future wetland development should be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, and that they have as much right to govern their own resources as other countries.
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that they have the right to govern their own resources and that wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth. 
  Therefore, a principle that supports the right of individual nations to govern their own resources would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  The only choice that supports this principle is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Criticism: 
  While choice D supports the Figorian Development Commission's position that they have the right to govern their own resources, it does not directly address the argument that wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  Therefore, another choice could potentially be a stronger answer depending on how the question is interpreted.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that wetland development should be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth and that they have the right to govern their own resources.
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth and that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  The principle that would most strongly support this position is one that prioritizes a nation's right to govern its own resources over international regulation or the needs of future generations.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Criticism: 
  The principle in choice D does not directly support the Figorian Development Commission's position. It does not prioritize a nation's right to govern its own resources over international regulation or the needs of future generations.
  Choice E may be a better answer as it suggests that depletion of natural resources is imprudent, which supports the idea that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission advocates for regulating wetland development in Figoria and offsetting it with the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth, as other nations have done, and that they have the right to govern their own resources.
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth and that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  The principle that would most strongly support this position is one that prioritizes a nation's right to govern its own resources over international regulation or the preservation of wildlife.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
Criticism: 
  The correct answer is not entirely clear-cut, as the argument presented by the Figorian Development Commission is complex and could be supported by a variety of principles.
  However, D is the most plausible answer, as it emphasizes the idea that each nation should be responsible for regulating its own environmental impact and that international regulation should not be overly restrictive.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.

  This principle supports the columnist's reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is B.
Criticism:
  The columnist's reasoning is based on the assumption that the democracy is not well-functioning because a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights will not be passed due to the influence of those who would be adversely affected.
  However, principle B does not necessarily mean that the democracy is not well-functioning if the bill does not pass.
  It is possible that the democracy is well-functioning, but the influential people have legitimate reasons for opposing the bill.
  Therefore, while principle B supports the columnist's reasoning, it is not a definitive justification for the columnist's conclusion about the functioning of the democracy.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise
  C: criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself
  D: taking lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining that claim
  E: presupposing what it sets out to establish

  E: The editorial presupposes that the premier wants to reduce taxes without significantly decreasing government services, which is what it sets out to establish.
Thought: 
  The editorial criticizes the economic advisor's character rather than examining the substance of his advice.
  This is a questionable argumentative strategy because the advisor's past conviction for embezzlement may not be relevant to his current ability to provide sound economic advice.
  The editorial assumes that the advisor's past conviction undermines his credibility without examining the substance of his advice.
  Therefore, the questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument is criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself.
  The answer is C: criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The editorial argues that the premier should not listen to her economic advisor.
  The advisor was convicted of embezzlement in his youth.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- The biologist argues that humans' five-finger configuration is not inherently superior to other possible configurations.
- The biologist suggests that humans would be content with a different configuration if we had evolved from a fish with that configuration.
Thought:
- The biologist's argument is based on the idea that humans' preference for a five-finger configuration is not based on any inherent superiority of that configuration.
- Therefore, an answer choice that supports the idea that humans' preference for a five-finger configuration is not based on any inherent superiority would strengthen the biologist's argument.
- Answer choice A does not strengthen the argument because it does not address the issue of whether the five-finger configuration is inherently superior.
- Answer choice B actually weakens the argument by suggesting that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness, which implies that the five-finger configuration is inherently more useful than other configurations.
- Answer choice C is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of whether the five-finger configuration is inherently superior.
- Answer choice D supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of the five-finger configuration is based on our prejudices rather than any inherent superiority.
- Answer choice E is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of whether the five-finger configuration is inherently superior.
Criticism:
- The biologist's argument is based on the assumption that humans' preference for a five-finger configuration is not based on any inherent superiority of that configuration.
- However, the argument does not address the issue of whether the five-finger configuration is actually more useful than other configurations in practice.
- Therefore, an answer choice that addresses the issue of whether the five-finger configuration is actually more useful than other configurations would be more relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not inherently better or worse than any other possible configuration.
  A: This statement does not support the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is too extreme and not relevant to the argument.
  C: This statement is too extreme and not relevant to the argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not based on any objective measure.
  E: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not inherently better or worse than any other possible configuration.
  If the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices, then it supports the biologist's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Criticism: 
  The argument is based on a hypothetical scenario, and the biologist's conclusion is not necessarily true.
  The statement in option D is a possibility, but it is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the most useful configuration.
  A: This statement does not strengthen the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is based on our prejudices.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument, as it suggests that humans could have evolved with six fingers.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the most useful configuration.
  If the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices, then the biologist's argument is strengthened.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Criticism: 
  The argument is not necessarily that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices, but rather that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  However, the statement in choice D does support the idea that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is based on our prejudices, which does strengthen the biologist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the best or most useful configuration.
- The biologist suggests that if humans had evolved from a fish with six phalanges in its fins, we would be just as content with six fingers per hand.
Thought:
- The biologist's argument is based on the idea that the usefulness of our fingers is not necessarily tied to the number of phalanges in a fish's fins.
- Therefore, the best answer choice will support this idea.
- Answer choice E is somewhat related to the argument, but it doesn't necessarily strengthen it. Just because a fish had six phalanges in its fins doesn't mean that humans would be content with six fingers per hand.
- Answer choice A is irrelevant to the argument, as the biologist is not making a claim about how content people are with their fingers.
- Answer choice B is actually counter to the biologist's argument, as the biologist is arguing that usefulness is not the only factor in determining contentment.
- Answer choice C is also counter to the biologist's argument, as the biologist is arguing that usefulness is not the only factor in determining contentment.
- Answer choice D is the best answer, as it directly supports the biologist's argument that our perception of the usefulness of our fingers is not necessarily accurate.
Criticism:
- The argument is based on the assumption that the number of fingers we have is not necessarily the best or most useful configuration, but this assumption is not necessarily true.
- The argument also assumes that humans would be content with any number of fingers, but this may not be the case.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if they had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
- The biologist argues that our current configuration of fingers is not inherently more or less useful than other possible configurations.
- The biologist suggests that humans would be content with a different configuration of fingers if that had been the result of our evolutionary history.
Thought:
- The argument is based on the premise that the number of phalanges in a fish's fins determined the number of fingers humans have.
- The argument suggests that the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not based on any inherent superiority, but rather on our prejudices.
- To strengthen the argument, we need to find a statement that supports the idea that our current configuration of fingers is not inherently better than other possible configurations.
- Choice E provides evidence that at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins, which supports the idea that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if they had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges.
- Therefore, E is the correct answer.
Criticism:
- None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the only or best configuration.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that our perception of the usefulness of our current configuration of fingers is not necessarily accurate.
  E: This statement supports the biologist's argument that there are other possible configurations of fingers.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers.
  The statement that at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins supports the biologist's argument that there are other possible configurations of fingers.
  Therefore, E is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic of the answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers and still be content with it.
- The biologist uses the example of a fish with five phalanges in its fins to support their argument.
Choices:
A: This statement does not provide any evidence to support the biologist's argument. It only talks about contentment with our present configuration, which is not relevant to the argument.
B: This statement goes against the biologist's argument by stating that humans are never content with two things of unequal usefulness. The biologist argues that humans could be content with a different configuration of fingers even if it is not more or less useful than our current configuration.
C: This statement also goes against the biologist's argument by stating that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness. The biologist argues that humans could be content with a different configuration of fingers even if it is not more or less useful than our current configuration.
D: This statement supports the biologist's argument by suggesting that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on objective facts but rather on our prejudices. This implies that we could be just as content with a different configuration of fingers.
E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument by suggesting that at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins. This implies that humans could have evolved with six fingers if they had descended from this species of fish.
Thought:
The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers and still be content with it. They use the example of a fish with five phalanges in its fins to support their argument. If it were true that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices, then this would strengthen the biologist's argument. This is because it would suggest that humans could be just as content with a different configuration of fingers. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Criticism:
None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on objective facts.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument because it suggests that humans could have evolved with six fingers if a fish with six phalanges in its fins had been our ancestor.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations.
  If the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices, then we could be content with any number of fingers.
  Therefore, D most strengthens the biologist's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if they had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
  A: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  C: This statement is not relevant to the biologist's argument.
  D: This statement supports the biologist's argument that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is based on our prejudices.
  E: This statement weakens the biologist's argument because it suggests that humans could have had six fingers if they had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that humans could have had a different configuration of fingers if they had descended from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
  The argument is based on the idea that our current configuration of fingers is not inherently more useful than other possible configurations.
  The biologist's argument would be strengthened if there were evidence that other species had evolved with different configurations of fingers.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. 
  However, it is possible that the existence of a fish with six phalanges in its fins does not necessarily mean that humans could have evolved to have six fingers.
  The argument is based on the idea that our current configuration of fingers is not inherently more useful than other possible configurations, but it is not clear that this is true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The biologist argues that the number of fingers humans have is not necessarily the most useful configuration.
- The biologist suggests that humans would be content with a different number of fingers if we had evolved from a fish with a different number of phalanges in its fins.
- The argument is based on the idea that usefulness is not the only factor that determines contentment.
Thought:
- To strengthen the biologist's argument, we need to find a statement that supports the idea that humans can be content with a different number of fingers.
- Option A is not helpful because it does not address the possibility of humans being content with a different number of fingers.
- Option B is also not helpful because it assumes that humans always prioritize usefulness over contentment, which is not necessarily true.
- Option C is closer to the biologist's argument, but it is too strong of a statement to be supported by evidence.
- Option D is also not helpful because it assumes that the perceived usefulness of our fingers is entirely based on prejudices, which is not necessarily true.
- Option E is the most helpful because it provides evidence that a different number of phalanges in fish fins is possible, which supports the idea that humans could be content with a different number of fingers.
Criticism:
- Option E supports the idea that a different number of fingers is possible, but it does not necessarily support the idea that humans would be content with a different number of fingers.

Choices:
  A: Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible.
  B: Only the tastiest ingredients should ever be used in cooking.
  C: Ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful.
  D: Parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking.
  E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
Thought:
  The argument is based on the premise that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.

  C: This principle states that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful.
  D: This principle states that parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking.
  E: This principle states that in cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Thought: 
  The argument is that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  Principle A is too broad and does not specifically address the issue of dried parsley.
  Principle B is too extreme and does not take into account other factors such as healthfulness.
  Principle C is too general and does not specifically address the issue of dried parsley.
  Principle D is too extreme and does not take into account other factors such as the practicality of finding tasty and healthful parsley.
  Principle E directly addresses the issue of dried parsley being less tasty and is therefore the most relevant principle to justify the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Criticism: 
  The argument is not that all dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients, but specifically that dried parsley is inferior to fresh parsley.
  Therefore, principle E may be too broad and not specific enough to justify the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")

  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  A: The principle that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible is a general guideline that is often followed in cooking.
  B: The principle that only the tastiest ingredients should ever be used in cooking is not always followed in cooking.
  C: The principle that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful is not necessarily true.
  D: The principle that parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking is too strict and not always followed in cooking.
  E: The principle that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients is relevant to the argument made in the passage.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  The principle that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients supports this argument.
  Therefore, E is the most valid principle that helps to justify the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
Thought:
  The argument is based on the premise that dried parsley is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  The principle that would most clearly help to justify the argument would be one that supports the idea that fresh ingredients are generally better than dried ingredients.
  Choice A says that fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible, which supports the argument.
  Choice B says that only the tastiest ingredients should be used, which is too extreme and not directly relevant to the argument.
  Choice C says that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful, which is too general and not directly relevant to the argument.
  Choice D says that parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking, which is too specific and not directly relevant to the argument.
  Choice E says that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients, which directly supports the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Criticism:
  The argument only concerns parsley, not all dried ingredients, so the principle in choice E may not be applicable to all situations.
Action: Answer("E")

  E: This principle suggests that dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients, which supports the argument that dried parsley should never be used.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  Principle C suggests that ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful.
  Therefore, the argument is justified in claiming that dried parsley should never be used in cooking.
  The answer is C.
Criticism: 
  The argument claims that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley.
  However, the argument does not provide any evidence to support the claim that dried parsley is less healthful than fresh parsley.
  Therefore, the argument is not fully justified.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:

  The detective presumes that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary.
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
Thought:
  A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized than those of the accountants, it would be less likely that one of the actuaries could have embezzled the money.
  B: If persons outside XYZ Corporation had access to the internal financial records, it is possible that the embezzlement was committed by someone who was not an accountant or an actuary.
  C: If there are more accountants than actuaries, it is less likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
  D: If an independent report concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place, it is possible that the embezzlement was committed by someone who was not an accountant or an actuary.
  E: If security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, it is less likely that one of the actuaries could have embezzled the money.
  None of these choices directly weaken the detective's argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:

  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  A: The activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized than those of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security that could have given outsiders access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants and two actuaries.
  D: An independent report before the crime concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to access internal financial records than for the accountants.
Thought:
  A weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that the accountants could have had the opportunity to embezzle.
  B weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that someone outside of XYZ Corporation could have had access to the internal financial records.
  C does not weaken the detective's argument because it does not address the likelihood of an accountant or an actuary being the embezzler.
  D does not weaken the detective's argument because it is not relevant to the likelihood of an accountant or an actuary being the embezzler.
  E does not weaken the detective's argument because it does not address the likelihood of an accountant or an actuary being the embezzler.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.

Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because they had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, and an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that were made.
  A: This weakens the detective's argument because if the actuaries were more closely scrutinized, it would be less likely that they could have embezzled money without being caught.
  B: This weakens the detective's argument because if someone outside of XYZ Corporation had access to internal financial records, it would not necessarily have to be an accountant or an actuary who committed the embezzlement.
  C: This does not weaken the detective's argument because it does not address the issue of whether an accountant or an actuary is more likely to have committed the embezzlement.
  D: This does not weaken the detective's argument because it is not clear how an independent report released before the crime took place would affect the likelihood of an accountant or an actuary committing the embezzlement.
  E: This weakens the detective's argument because if certain security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, it would be less likely that an actuary committed the embezzlement.

Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because they had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, and accountants would not have made the mistakes that were made.
  A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized, it would make it less likely that one of them would have been able to embezzle without being caught. This strengthens, rather than weakens, the detective's argument. Therefore, A does not weaken the argument.
  B: If someone outside of the corporation had access to the records, it would weaken the argument that the embezzler was an actuary or accountant. Therefore, B weakens the argument.
  C: The number of accountants and actuaries employed by the corporation is not relevant to the argument. Therefore, C weakens the argument.
  D: The fact that the corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place does not necessarily mean that the embezzler was an actuary or accountant. Therefore, D weakens the argument.
  E: If it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, it would weaken the argument that the embezzler was an actuary. Therefore, E weakens the argument.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
Thought: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film because ticket sales generate revenue.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows because the revenue model is different.
  Option A is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option B is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option C is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option D is relevant because television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  Option E is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
Criticism:

  Option A is irrelevant to the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  Option C is not a valid reason for the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  Option D provides a valid reason for the difference in goals between movie and television executives because television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  Option E is not a valid reason for the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
Thought: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film because the more people who see it, the more revenue they can generate from ticket sales.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows because they make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  Choice D most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives because it explains that television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. Therefore, television executives are more concerned with attracting viewers who have a higher purchasing power, rather than just maximizing the number of viewers.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
Criticism: 
  Choice C could also be a possible answer because if the average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television, then movie executives would have to maximize the number of people who see a film to generate enough revenue to cover the high production costs. However, choice D is still a better answer because it directly explains the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.

  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch. - This option does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
Thought: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film because the more people who see a film, the more revenue the movie will generate from ticket sales. 
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows because the revenue generated from viewership is not the primary source of income for television shows. 
  The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television, which explains why movie executives are more focused on maximizing the number of people who see a film.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.

On the other hand, television executives can make a profit with fewer viewers because their costs are lower.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
    This choice does not explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

  Choice A is not relevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Choice B is not relevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Choice C is not relevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Choice D helps to explain why television executives do not necessarily want to maximize the number of viewers for their shows, because sponsors are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

  Every print sold in the museum store is either a print of a work on loan from a private collector or a print of a work in the museum's permanent collection.
  The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  Therefore, every print sold in the museum store is a print of a twentieth-century work.
  The museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  Therefore, Hopper's Nighthawks is not part of the museum's permanent collection.

  Therefore, it cannot be determined whether Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan from a private collector or not.
  It is not stated that there are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  Therefore, C is not necessarily true.
Criticism: 
  Your answer that every print sold in the museum store is a print of a twentieth-century work is correct.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

  The argument is that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant, and thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
  A weakens the argument by stating that the more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B does not weaken the argument, as it states that the more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C is irrelevant to the argument, as it talks about appointing an impartial arbitrator, not about trial by jury.
  D is also irrelevant to the argument, as it talks about how experts give testimony, not about the fairness of trial by jury.
  E is also irrelevant to the argument, as it talks about the cost of expert witnesses, not about the fairness of trial by jury.
  Therefore, A is the best answer as it weakens the argument.

  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.
Thought:
  The argument is that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Option A weakens the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge may still be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  Option B does not weaken the argument, as it suggests that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced in favor of one party.
  Option C is irrelevant to the argument, as it discusses appointing an impartial arbitrator instead of trial by jury.
  Option D is also irrelevant, as it discusses the behavior of expert witnesses rather than the fairness of trial by jury.
  Option E is also irrelevant, as it discusses the cost of expert witnesses rather than the fairness of trial by jury.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.

  This view is challenged by scientists who hold that it formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  The geologist's argument is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  This argument is challenged by scientists who hold that it formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  The geologist's argument is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  To weaken the geologist's argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that petroleum could form without the presence of living organisms.
  A: This answer choice does not weaken the geologist's argument because it is possible for fossils to exist without biomarkers.
  B: This answer choice is irrelevant to the argument since it does not address the formation of petroleum.
  C: This answer choice actually strengthens the geologist's argument by suggesting that it would take a long time for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: This answer choice is also irrelevant to the argument since it does not address the formation of petroleum.
  E: This answer choice weakens the geologist's argument by suggesting that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, not from living organisms.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Criticism:
  The answer choice E does not necessarily refute the argument of the scientists who hold that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  It only suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
  Therefore, the answer choice E only weakens the geologist's argument to a certain extent.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust.
  Some scientists challenge this view and suggest that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  The geologist's argument is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum, which indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  The argument is supported by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that suggests that the presence of biomarkers does not necessarily indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
  Option A suggests that fossils can exist without biomarkers, but it does not directly weaken the argument that biomarkers indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C supports the geologist's argument that it would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which supports the geologist's argument.
  Therefore, none of the options weakens the geologist's argument.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.
  None of the options directly weakens the geologist's argument.
  However, option A could indirectly weaken the argument by suggesting that the absence of biomarkers does not necessarily mean that the fossilized remains did not come from living organisms.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust.
  The challenge to this view is that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth.
  Biomarkers are molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is based on the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  If there are other ways that biomarkers could have been present in petroleum, then the geologist's argument is weakened.
  A: This weakens the argument that fossils are the source of petroleum, but it does not weaken the argument that biomarkers indicate the presence of living organisms.
  B: This is irrelevant to the argument.
  C: This supports the argument that petroleum comes from fossils, since it would take a long time for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: This is irrelevant to the argument.
  E: This supports the argument that petroleum comes from fossils, since some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
Criticism:
  The argument is not that fossils are the only source of petroleum, but that they are one source.
  Therefore, the discovery of fossils without biomarkers does not necessarily weaken the argument that biomarkers indicate the presence of living organisms.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they must have an immunity to that microorganism.
  The argument is flawed because not developing symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has immunity to the microorganism.
  A: This argument is about the relationship between morality and the interests of everyone. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  B: This argument is about whether writers of fiction try to persuade people that certain claims are true. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  C: This argument is about whether Isabel took medication or not. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  D: This argument is about the relationship between excessive taxation and business expansion. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  E: This argument is about the value of hand-washing in preventing disease. It is not similar to the student's argument.
Thought: 
  The student's argument is flawed because not developing symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has immunity to the microorganism.
  The argument assumes that exposure to the microorganism is the only factor that determines whether a person develops harmful symptoms.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the student's argument is flawed because not developing symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has immunity to the microorganism.
  However, the argument does not assume that exposure to the microorganism is the only factor that determines whether a person develops harmful symptoms.
  Therefore, the answer may not be C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. 
  The student then argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  A: This argument is about the relationship between morality and serving the interests of everyone.
  B: This argument is about the persuasive intentions of advertisers and writers of fiction.
  C: This argument is about the relationship between medication and curing disease or alleviating its symptoms.
  D: This argument is about the relationship between taxation and business expansion.
  E: This argument is about the value of handwashing in preventing disease.
Thought: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  This is similar to option C, which assumes that if medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, then a person who is still quite ill must not have taken the medication.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to option C.
  The answer is C.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct. The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms means that a person has an immunity to infection by this microorganism, which is not necessarily true.
  Option C is also flawed because it assumes that if medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, then a person who is still quite ill must not have taken the medication, which is not necessarily true.
  However, your answer is still the best choice among the given options.
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The student argues that if a person has immunity to a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms.
  The student argues that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms.
Thought:
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity to staphylococcus. However, this assumption is not necessarily true because some people may be carriers of staphylococcus without developing symptoms, but they can still spread the infection to others. Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to choice C, which assumes that taking medication will either cure disease or alleviate its symptoms.
Criticism:
  The criticism is that the student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity to staphylococcus. However, this assumption is not necessarily true because some people may be carriers of staphylococcus without developing symptoms, but they can still spread the infection to others. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they must have an immunity to that microorganism.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is always due to immunity.
  A: This argument is about the relationship between morality and serving the interests of everyone. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  B: This argument is about whether writers of fiction try to persuade people that certain claims are true. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  C: This argument is about whether Isabel took her medication or not. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  D: This argument is about the relationship between excessive taxation and business expansions. It is not similar to the student's argument.
  E: This argument is about the value of hand-washing in preventing disease. It is not similar to the student's argument.
Thought: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is always due to immunity.
  This is similar to an argument that assumes that a particular cause is always responsible for a particular effect.
  For example, assuming that a decline in business expansions is always due to excessive taxation.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to D.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  However, it is important to note that the argument in D is flawed because it assumes a cause-and-effect relationship without considering other possible factors.
  Similarly, the student's argument assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is always due to immunity, without considering other possible explanations.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they have an immunity to that microorganism.
  The student then concludes that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, they have an immunity to staphylococcus.
  A: This argument is about morality and interests, and does not relate to the student's argument.
  B: This argument is about advertising and fiction, and does not relate to the student's argument.
  C: This argument is about medication and illness, and does not relate to the student's argument.
  D: This argument is about taxation and business expansions, and does not relate to the student's argument.
  E: This argument is about hand washing and disease prevention, and does not relate to the student's argument.
Thought: 
  The student's argument assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms is evidence of immunity to staphylococcus.
  However, this assumption is flawed because many people can be exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms, but they may not necessarily have an immunity to staphylococcus.
  Therefore, the student's argument is flawed.
  The pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is most similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in option C.
  Isabel assumes that taking medication will cure her illness, and concludes that since she is still ill, she did not take the medication.
  However, this assumption is flawed because medication may not always cure an illness, and there may be other reasons why Isabel is still ill.
  Therefore, the flawed pattern of reasoning in both arguments is that they make unwarranted assumptions and draw unsupported conclusions.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person has an immunity to a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms.
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  A: This argument is about the relationship between morality and serving the interests of everyone.
  B: This argument is about the persuasive intentions of advertisers and writers of fiction.
  C: This argument is about the relationship between medication and curing or alleviating symptoms of a disease.
  D: This argument is about the relationship between excessive taxation and business expansion.
  E: This argument is about the value of hand-washing in preventing disease.
Thought: 
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they must have an immunity to that microorganism.
  This is flawed because it assumes that the only reason a person does not develop harmful symptoms is because they have an immunity to the microorganism, when in fact there could be other reasons.
  For example, the person may have been exposed to a very small amount of the microorganism, or their immune system may have fought off the infection without developing symptoms.
  Similarly, just because a person is exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms does not necessarily mean they have an immunity to the microorganism.
  Therefore, the student's argument is flawed.
  The pattern of reasoning is most similar to C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  This argument assumes that medication is the only way to cure a disease or alleviate its symptoms, when in fact there could be other reasons why Isabel is still ill.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they have an immunity to that microorganism.
  The student assumes that exposure without symptoms implies immunity.
  The student uses staphylococcus as an example of a microorganism that many people are exposed to without developing harmful symptoms.
Thought: 
  The student's argument is flawed because they assume that exposure without symptoms implies immunity. This is not necessarily true. Many people may be exposed to staphylococcus without developing symptoms, but this does not mean that they are immune to it. 
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is most similar to option C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill. 
  The student assumes that exposure without symptoms implies immunity, just as Isabel assumes that taking medication implies a cure or alleviation of symptoms. Both assumptions are flawed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms from a microorganism, then they must have an immunity to that microorganism.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to a microorganism without developing harmful symptoms means that a person has immunity to that microorganism.
  A: This argument is about moral rightness and interests, and does not relate to the student's argument.
  B: This argument is about whether fiction writers try to persuade people, and does not relate to the student's argument.
  C: This argument is about whether Isabel took medication, and does not relate to the student's argument.
  D: This argument is about the relationship between business expansions and taxation, and does not relate to the student's argument.
  E: This argument is about the value of hand-washing in preventing disease, and does not relate to the student's argument.
Thought: 
  The student's argument assumes that exposure to a microorganism without developing harmful symptoms means that a person has immunity to that microorganism.
  This is flawed because it is possible for a person to be exposed to a microorganism without developing symptoms, but not have immunity to that microorganism.
  This is similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in option C, which assumes that because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, if Isabel is still quite ill, then she must not have taken the medication.
  This is also similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in option E, which assumes that because doctors tend to wash their hands less often than other health care professionals, hand-washing cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
  However, the argument in option C is a better match because it is more directly related to the idea of assuming a causal relationship between two things based on incomplete evidence.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  A: The argument talks about morality and interests, and how some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: The argument talks about how advertisers try to persuade people and that writers of fiction probably never try to persuade people.
  C: The argument talks about how Isabel said she would take the medication, but she is still quite ill.
  D: The argument talks about how excessive taxation makes business owners less willing to expand their businesses, and the recent decline in business expansions shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: The argument talks about how doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals, and this shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Thought: 
  The student's argument is that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  However, the fact that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms does not necessarily mean that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  Therefore, the student's argument is flawed.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is most similar to that in option C, where Isabel said she would take the medication, but she is still quite ill. Just because Isabel said she would take the medication does not necessarily mean that she actually took it, and just because many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms does not necessarily mean that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The student argues that if a person has an immunity to a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms.
  The student argues that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms.
Thought: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that exposure to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms means that a person has immunity to staphylococcus. This is not necessarily true because some people may have developed immunity to staphylococcus, while others may simply not have been exposed to a sufficient amount of the microorganism to cause harmful symptoms. 
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is most similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning in option C. Isabel's failure to take medication does not necessarily mean that medication cannot cure or alleviate symptoms. There may be other reasons why Isabel is still quite ill.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Response 0:

  The evolution of the anatomically modern human brain required a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats.
  Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans.
  Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Thought: 
  The conflict presented is that the evolution of the human brain required a high-calorie diet that was most abundant and reliable in shore environments, but the evolution of the human brain took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find a statement that explains why the evolution of the human brain took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas despite the fact that the high-calorie diet was most abundant and reliable in shore environments.
  Option A talks about the metabolic rate of early humans, but it does not explain the conflict.
  Option B talks about the size of the earliest known human brains, but it does not explain the conflict.
  Option C suggests that prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today, but it does not explain why the shore environments were not used.
  Option D talks about the techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites, but it does not explain the conflict.
  Option E suggests that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. This could explain why early humans did not use shore environments despite the high-calorie diet available there.
Criticism: 
  Option E suggests that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. This could explain why early humans did not use shore environments despite the high-calorie diet available there.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Sarah: When commercial fishing boats with permits to fish for certain species accidentally catch a type of fish for which they have no permit, the latter must be thrown back. This is a very wasteful practice because many, if not most, of the rejected fish do not survive. Fishing permits should therefore be altered so that fishers can keep fish caught accidentally. Amar: Making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more "accidents."
Question: The technique Amar uses in responding to Sarah's argument is to
Choices:
  A: question whether Sarah's recommendation can be put into practice
  B: point out that Sarah used a crucial term in two distinct senses
  C: allude to a factor that supposedly strengthens the case for Sarah's recommendation
  D: contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence
  E: maintain that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies

Amar is not questioning whether Sarah's recommendation can be put into practice, pointing out that Sarah used a crucial term in two distinct senses, alluding to a factor that supposedly strengthens the case for Sarah's recommendation, or contending that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence. 
  Amar is maintaining that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Sarah argues that commercial fishing boats with permits to fish for certain species accidentally catch a type of fish for which they have no permit, and the latter must be thrown back, which is wasteful.
  Sarah recommends that fishing permits should be altered so that fishers can keep fish caught accidentally.
  Amar responds that making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more "accidents."
Thought:
  Amar's response is a counterargument to Sarah's recommendation.
  Amar argues that if fishers are allowed to keep fish caught accidentally, they may intentionally catch more of those fish.
  Therefore, Amar is pointing out a negative consequence of Sarah's recommendation.
  The answer is D: contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence.
Criticism:
  Your answer is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Sarah argues that throwing back accidentally caught fish is wasteful and fishing permits should be altered to allow fishers to keep them.
  Amar argues that allowing fishers to keep accidentally caught fish would lead to more "accidents."
Thought:
  Amar is responding to Sarah's argument by pointing out a potential negative consequence of her recommendation.
  He is suggesting that allowing fishers to keep accidentally caught fish would incentivize them to catch more of those fish, potentially leading to overfishing or other negative effects.
  Therefore, the technique Amar uses in responding to Sarah's argument is to contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence.
  The answer is D: contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence.
Criticism:
  Your answer is correct. Amar is pointing out a potential negative consequence of Sarah's recommendation, which is a valid technique in responding to an argument.
  There is no evidence to suggest that Amar is questioning whether Sarah's recommendation can be put into practice, pointing out a crucial term used in two distinct senses, alluding to a factor that strengthens the case for Sarah's recommendation, or maintaining that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Sarah suggests that fishing permits should be altered so that fishers can keep fish caught accidentally.
  Amar argues that making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more "accidents."
Thought:
  Amar is responding to Sarah's argument by presenting a counterargument.
  He is suggesting that Sarah's recommendation would have negative consequences.
  Specifically, he is arguing that if fishers are allowed to keep fish caught accidentally, they will be more likely to "accidentally" catch those fish.
  Therefore, Amar is using the technique of pointing out a negative consequence of Sarah's recommendation.
  The answer is D: contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence to suggest that Amar is questioning whether Sarah's recommendation can be put into practice, alluding to a factor that supposedly strengthens the case for Sarah's recommendation, or maintaining that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies.
  However, it is possible that Amar is pointing out that Sarah used a crucial term in two distinct senses (i.e. "accidentally" catching fish), which could make the answer B a plausible choice.
  Nevertheless, the most accurate answer is D. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Sarah suggests that fishing permits should be altered so that fishers can keep fish caught accidentally.
  Amar argues that making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more "accidents."
Thought: 
  Amar is not questioning whether Sarah's recommendation can be put into practice.
  Amar is not pointing out that Sarah used a crucial term in two distinct senses.
  Amar is not alluding to a factor that supposedly strengthens the case for Sarah's recommendation.
  Amar is not contending that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence.
  Amar is maintaining that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies.
  Amar is suggesting that if fishers are allowed to keep fish caught accidentally, they would be incentivized to catch more fish than they have permits for.
  This would lead to overfishing and depletion of fish populations.
  Therefore, Amar's technique is to maintain that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies.
  The answer is E: maintain that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

Knowledge: 
  Carpal tunnel syndrome is a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists and is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard.
  A recent study found that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Choices:
  A: This choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work. However, this does not explain why those with the least control have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  B: This choice suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This could help explain the study's findings as it suggests that the lack of control may lead to emotional stress that could increase the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  C: This choice suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This does not explain why those with the least control have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: This choice suggests that among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work. This does not explain why those who use keyboards have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  E: This choice suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This does not explain why those with the least control have almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome from typing.
Thought: 
  The study found that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Choice B suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  Emotional stress could be a factor that increases the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Therefore, choice B most helps to explain the study's findings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Carpal tunnel syndrome is a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists.
  Repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard can cause carpal tunnel syndrome.
  A recent study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Thought: 
  The study found that office workers who reported the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need to find an answer choice that helps explain why this is the case.
  Answer choice A suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work. This would suggest that the amount of typing is a factor in the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, and that those with less control over their work are typing more, which could explain the higher risk.
  Answer choice B suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This may be true, but it does not directly explain the study's findings.
  Answer choice C suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This may be true, but it does not explain why those with less control over their work are at a higher risk.
  Answer choice D suggests that among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work. This answer choice is not relevant to the study's findings, which specifically looked at office workers who do similar amounts of typing.
  Answer choice E suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This would suggest that the amount of typing is not the only factor in the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, and that those with less control over their work may be performing other repetitive motions that contribute to the higher risk.
  Answer choice A is the best answer because it directly addresses the amount of typing that office workers are doing, which is the focus of the study's findings.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Carpal tunnel syndrome is a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists.
  Repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard can cause carpal tunnel syndrome.
  A recent study found that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Thought: 
  The study found that office workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need to find an option that explains why this is the case.
  Option A suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work. This option does not explain why workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Option B suggests that feeling a lack of control over one's own work tends to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. This option provides a possible explanation for the study's findings, as it suggests that the emotional stress caused by feeling a lack of control over one's own work may make one more susceptible to carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Option C suggests that the keyboards on which office workers type tend to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. This option does not explain why workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Option D suggests that among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work. This option does not provide an explanation for the study's findings, as it focuses on office workers who rarely use keyboards, rather than those who do similar amounts of typing.
  Option E suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This option does not explain why workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Option B is the most plausible explanation for the study's findings, as it suggests that the emotional stress caused by feeling a lack of control over one's own work may make one more susceptible to carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous, despite the fact that this drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy indicated above?
Choices:
  A: The drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available.
  B: The drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low.
  C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
  D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
  E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.

  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

Knowledge: 
  The argument states that Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. However, the concert did not sell out, leading to the conclusion that it was probably not properly promoted.
Thought: 
  Wells, who is knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  The concert did not sell out.
  Therefore, it was probably not properly promoted.
  The reasoning involves an expert opinion and a prediction that did not come true, leading to a conclusion about the cause of the prediction not coming true.
  The pattern of reasoning is similar to that in option B, where Professor Willis, who is knowledgeable about organic chemistry, predicts that a sample does not contain organic compounds, and concludes that the sample is not labeled correctly.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the reasoning.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear, based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  A: This criticism attacks the argument for generalizing from a few bears to all Kodiak bears.

Thought:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear, based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  Criticism A is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not generalize from a few bears to all Kodiak bears.
  Criticism B is relevant to the argument, as the argument does not consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  Criticism C is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not use the word "behavior" in two different ways.
  Criticism D is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not presume that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  Criticism E is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not appeal to the authority of science to support its conclusion.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is an instinctive behavior of Kodiak bears based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  A: This criticism suggests that the argument may have relied on a small sample size or a non-representative sample of Kodiak bears to support its conclusion.
  B: This criticism suggests that the argument may have overlooked other factors that could contribute to the behavior of walking on hind legs in Kodiak bears.
  C: This criticism suggests that the argument may have used the term "behavior" inconsistently or in a way that is unclear or misleading.
  D: This criticism suggests that the argument may have oversimplified the ways in which behavior can be explained or categorized.
  E: This criticism suggests that the argument may have relied too heavily on the authority of science or scientific research to support its conclusion.
Thought:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is an instinctive behavior of Kodiak bears based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  The criticism that the argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity is valid.
  It is possible that both learning and an innate capacity contribute to the behavior of walking on hind legs in Kodiak bears.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that the Kodiak bear's ability to walk on hind legs is instinctive and not learned.
  A: This criticism suggests that the argument may have only observed a few bears and cannot generalize to all Kodiak bears.
  B: This criticism suggests that the argument may not have considered the possibility that walking on hind legs is both innate and learned.
  C: This criticism suggests that the argument may have used the word "behavior" in different ways, which could lead to confusion or ambiguity.
  D: This criticism suggests that the argument may have assumed that all behavior can be explained in only two ways, without providing justification for this assumption.
  E: This criticism suggests that the argument may have relied too heavily on the authority of science to support its conclusion.
Thought:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is an instinctive behavior for Kodiak bears.
  The criticism that the argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity is relevant.
  However, the argument specifically claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive, which suggests that it is not learned.
  Therefore, this criticism is not the most vulnerable.
  The other criticisms do not seem to be as relevant to the argument.
  The argument does not generalize from a few bears, change the meaning of "behavior," or assume that all behavior can be explained in only two ways.
  The argument does rely on scientific evidence, but this is not necessarily a weakness.
  Therefore, the most vulnerable criticism is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive for Kodiak bears due to the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  A: This criticism suggests that the argument may not have enough evidence to support its conclusion and may be making a hasty generalization.
  B: This criticism suggests that the argument may not have considered all possible explanations for the behavior of Kodiak bears.
  C: This criticism suggests that there is a problem with the way the argument uses the term "behavior".
  D: This criticism suggests that the argument may be oversimplifying the possible explanations for behavior.
  E: This criticism suggests that the argument is relying too heavily on the authority of science without providing enough evidence to support its claims.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive for Kodiak bears.
  The argument supports this claim by pointing to the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  The argument does not claim that all bears walk on hind legs, only that it is natural behavior for Kodiak bears.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism B, which suggests that there may be other explanations for the behavior of Kodiak bears.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear, based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  A: This criticism attacks the argument for generalizing from a few bears to all Kodiak bears. However, the argument does not make this mistake.
  B: This criticism attacks the argument for not considering the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity. However, the argument explicitly claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior.
  C: This criticism attacks the argument for using the word "behavior" in different ways. However, the argument consistently uses the word "behavior" to refer to walking on hind legs.
  D: This criticism attacks the argument for presuming that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways. However, the argument does not make this presumption.
  E: This criticism attacks the argument for appealing to the authority of science. However, the argument does not do this.
Thought: 
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear, based on the shape of their hip and foot bones.
  The criticism that the argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity is not valid because the argument explicitly claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior.
  Therefore, the argument is not vulnerable to any of the criticisms.
  None of the above.
Criticism: N/A
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:

  A: This criticism suggests that the argument may be based on a limited sample size and may not be representative of all Kodiak bears.
  B: This criticism suggests that the argument may not be considering other factors that could contribute to the behavior.
  C: This criticism suggests that the argument may be using the term "behavior" inconsistently or ambiguously.
  D: This criticism suggests that the argument may be oversimplifying the causes of behavior.
  E: This criticism suggests that the argument may be relying too heavily on the authority of science without providing sufficient evidence.
Thought:
  The argument is based on the shape of the hip and foot bones of Kodiak bears.
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive for these bears.
  The argument does not consider other factors that could contribute to the behavior.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism B, which suggests that the argument may be oversimplifying the causes of behavior.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear.
  A: This criticism claims that the argument is based on a small sample size, and therefore, the conclusion cannot be generalized to all Kodiak bears.

  E: This criticism claims that the argument inappropriately appeals to the authority of science.
Thought:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear.
  The criticism that the argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity does not necessarily undermine the argument.
  The other criticisms do not seem to apply to the argument.
  Therefore, the argument is not vulnerable to any of the criticisms.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Criticism:
  While the argument may be vulnerable to the criticism that it fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity, it is not clear that this criticism undermines the argument completely.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear.
  A: This criticism suggests that the argument is based on a sample that is too small or not representative enough.
  B: This criticism suggests that the argument fails to consider other possible explanations for the behavior.
  C: This criticism suggests that the argument uses the word "behavior" in different ways, which could be confusing or misleading.
  D: This criticism suggests that the argument assumes that there are only two possible explanations for behavior, which may not be true.
  E: This criticism suggests that the argument relies too heavily on the authority of science, which may not always be reliable or unbiased.
Thought:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak bear.
  The criticism that the argument fails to consider other possible explanations for the behavior is relevant, but it does not necessarily undermine the argument.
  The criticism that the argument assumes that there are only two possible explanations for behavior is not relevant, since the argument does not make this assumption.
  The criticism that the argument uses the word "behavior" in different ways is not relevant, since the argument is clear about what it means by this term.
  The criticism that the argument relies too heavily on the authority of science is not relevant, since the argument presents evidence to support its claim.
  The criticism that the argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion is the most relevant, since the argument may not be representative of all Kodiak bears.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In marketing their products, drug companies often send gifts to physicians. According to a recent survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Question: If the survey results are accurate, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs than those who do accept such gifts.
  B: Most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians.
  C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  D: Some physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts.
  E: All physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts.

  The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
  Therefore, some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  The answer is C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
Criticism:
  Your answer is correct. There is no criticism to be made.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Drug companies often send gifts to physicians to market their products.
  According to a recent survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Thought: 
  If the survey results are accurate, then it must be true that:
  - Physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs than those who do accept such gifts. (No information is given about the prescribing habits of physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies, so this cannot be true.)
  - Most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians. (The survey does not provide information on whether most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines, so this cannot be true.)
  - Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians. (This is a possible explanation for the survey results, so this could be true.)
  - Some physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts. (The survey indicates that most physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts, so this cannot be true.)
  - All physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts. (The survey does not provide information on whether all physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts, so this cannot be true.)
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is that some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Drug companies often send gifts to physicians in marketing their products.
  Most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  The majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts.
Thought: 
  If the survey results are accurate, then it must be true that some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians. This is because the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts, but most physicians believe that their own choices are not influenced by such gifts. Therefore, some physicians must be mistaken about either their own level of influence or the level of influence on other physicians.
  The answer is C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct. The survey results suggest that there is a discrepancy between physicians' beliefs about their own level of influence and the level of influence on other physicians. Therefore, it is likely that some physicians are mistaken about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians. 
  However, it is not necessarily true that all physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts. Therefore, option E cannot be completely ruled out.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Drug companies often send gifts to physicians in marketing their products.
  Most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  The majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts.
Thought: 
  If the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts, then they must believe that gifts from drug companies have some influence on prescription choices.
  If most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts, then they must believe that they are not influenced by gifts from drug companies.
  Therefore, some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  The answer is C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.

  Most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts.
  The majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by drug companies' gifts.
Thought: 
  If the survey results are accurate, then it must be true that some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  This is because the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts, but most physicians believe that their own choices are not influenced by such gifts.
  Therefore, some physicians must be mistaken about either their own level of influence or the level of influence on other physicians.
  The answer is C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct and the answer is C.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, but intellectual discipline is also necessary for intellectual progress.
Thought: 
  The conclusion drawn by the professor is that the argument for freedom of thought fails.
  This means that the professor believes that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress.
  Therefore, the professor must assume that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress.
  The assumption that would support the professor's conclusion is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The argument is that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress, and that intellectual discipline is also necessary.
Thought:
  The conclusion drawn by the professor is that the argument for freedom of thought fails.
  This conclusion would follow logically if it is assumed that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress, and that intellectual discipline is also necessary.
  Option E is the closest to this assumption, as it suggests that intellectual discipline is a precondition for freedom of thought.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Criticism:
  The assumption in option E is not exactly the same as the one required for the conclusion drawn by the professor.
  Option E suggests that intellectual discipline is a precondition for freedom of thought, while the conclusion drawn by the professor is that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress, and that intellectual discipline is also necessary.
  However, it can be argued that the assumption in option E is a necessary condition for the conclusion drawn by the professor.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The argument for freedom of thought is that it allows thinkers to pursue their ideas without being limited by whom these ideas offend or where they lead.
- The professor argues that intellectual progress requires thinkers to have intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
Thought:
- The professor argues that the argument for freedom of thought fails because intellectual progress requires intellectual discipline.
- To reach this conclusion, the professor must assume that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress.
- Therefore, the correct answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Criticism:
- The argument does not assume that freedom of thought is impossible without intellectual discipline, only that intellectual progress requires intellectual discipline.
- Therefore, answer E is not the correct assumption needed to reach the professor's conclusion.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The argument is that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, but that intellectual discipline is also necessary for progress.
- The professor claims that thinkers need intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The professor argues that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress.
  Intellectual discipline is necessary for making intellectual progress.
Thought: 
  The argument is that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress because intellectual discipline is also necessary.
  Therefore, the assumption that must be made is that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress.
  The only option that supports this assumption is B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  If thinkers can only mine the full implications of interrelated ideas in the context of a society that values intellectual progress, then freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress.
Action: Answer("B")

Thought: 
  The conclusion drawn by the professor is that the argument for freedom of thought fails.
  This means that the professor believes that freedom of thought alone is not enough for intellectual progress.
  The professor believes that intellectual discipline is also necessary for intellectual progress.
  Therefore, we can assume that the professor believes that freedom of thought and intellectual discipline are both necessary for intellectual progress.
  The assumption that would support this conclusion is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
  If thinkers lack intellectual discipline, then they will not be able to fully explore their ideas and pursue them in a meaningful way.
  Therefore, intellectual discipline is a necessary precondition for freedom of thought, and both are necessary for intellectual progress.
Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.

Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")

The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove. The fact that the author's friends voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The official results of the referendum show that 80 percent of the voters supported the proposal. The author's argument is based on a presumption that is not supported by the evidence.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B") 

The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove. The fact that everyone the speaker knows voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The official results of the national referendum indicate that 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. The speaker's argument is based solely on anecdotal evidence and does not take into account the possibility that the speaker's social circle may not be representative of the general population.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove. The fact that the person knows people who voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The official results of the national referendum indicate that 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal, which is a clear indication that most people voted for it. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.

The fact that the person knows people who voted against the proposal does not necessarily mean that most people voted against it. The official results of the referendum indicate that 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal, which is a clear indication that most people voted in favor of it. The argument is flawed because it assumes that the people the person knows are representative of the general population, which is unlikely to be true.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The argument assumes that the people the speaker knows are representative of the general population, which is not necessarily true. This is a flaw in the argument because it is possible that the people the speaker knows are not a representative sample of the population as a whole. Therefore, the argument is flawed because it fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted. The correct answer is D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")

The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people the arguer knows voted against the proposal. This is a flawed reasoning because the arguer's personal experience may not be representative of the entire population. The argument also ignores the official results of the referendum, which showed that 80 percent of the voters were in favor of the proposal. Therefore, the most accurate flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B") 

The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove. The speaker assumes that because everyone they know voted against the proposal, most people voted against it. However, this is a hasty generalization and does not necessarily reflect the views of the general population. The speaker assumes that their personal experience is representative of the entire population, which is a logical fallacy.
Response 7:

Thought: 
  The argument is that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers.
  This assumes that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that a laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a front-loading washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
  The answer is D: A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester has not received a raise, so it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation.
Question: The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
  B: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  C: My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house. Since anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own it.
  D: My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Since no one who lives in a house both O'WIlS it and pays rent on it, it must be that my next-door neighbors pay rent on their heuse.
  E: Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Therefore, it must be that they pay rent on it.

  B: The argument concludes that since no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, and my next-door neighbors own their house, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  C: The argument concludes that since my neighbors have not paid any rent on their house, and anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own it.
  D: The argument concludes that since no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, and my next-door neighbors do not own their house, it must be that they pay rent on it.
  E: The argument concludes that since anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it, and my next-door neighbors do not own their house, it must be that they pay rent on it.
Thought: 
  The argument above concludes that since no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise, and Lester has not received a raise, it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation. 
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why Lester has not received a raise.
  For example, the company may not have the budget to give out raises, or they may have a policy of not giving out raises until a certain amount of time has passed.
  Similarly, in option A, the conclusion that my neighbors do not own their house is flawed because there could be other reasons why they pay rent, such as renting out a room to someone else.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in option A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise.
  No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that not receiving a raise means that Lester received a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument does not consider other reasons why Lester may not have received a raise.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument is most similar to the reasoning in answer choice E.
  Answer: E. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that since no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise, and Lester has not received a raise, then he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  A: The argument concludes that since no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, and my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, then they must not own it.
  B: The argument concludes that since no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, and my next-door neighbors own their house, then they must not pay rent on it.
  C: The argument concludes that since my neighbors have not paid any rent on their house, and anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, then they must own it.
  D: The argument concludes that since no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, and my next-door neighbors do not own their house, then they must pay rent on it.
  E: The argument concludes that since anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it, and my next-door neighbors do not own their house, then they must pay rent on it.
Thought: 
  The argument above concludes that since no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise, and Lester has not received a raise, then he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  However, there could be other reasons why Lester did not receive a raise, such as budget constraints or a company-wide policy not to give raises.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed.
  Choice A has the same flawed reasoning, concluding that since no one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it, and my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, then they must not own it.
  However, my neighbors could be renting out their house to someone else while they themselves live elsewhere.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed.
  Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that receiving a raise and receiving a poor performance evaluation are mutually exclusive.
  Therefore, if someone has not received a raise, it must be that they have received a poor performance evaluation.
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why someone did not receive a raise.
  For example, the company may not have the budget for raises or may have a policy of not giving raises.
Criticism: 
  The flawed reasoning in the argument is most similar to the reasoning in option E.
  Option E assumes that anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it.
  Therefore, if someone does not own their house, it must be that they pay rent on it.
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why someone does not own their house.
  For example, they could be living in a house that is owned by a family member or friend.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise.
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that the only reason someone would not receive a raise is because of a poor performance evaluation.

Thought: 
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation. 
  The argument assumes that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why Lester has not received a raise.
  For example, the company may not have enough funds to give raises this year.
  This is similar to the flawed reasoning in option B, which concludes that the neighbors do not pay rent on their house just because they own it.
  There could be other reasons why the neighbors do not pay rent, such as owning the house outright or having a mortgage.
Criticism: 
  The reasoning in option A is not similar to the reasoning in the original argument.
  Option A concludes that the neighbors do not own their house just because they pay rent on it, which is a valid conclusion based on the premise given.
  Option C concludes that the neighbors own their house just because they have not paid rent on it, which is also a valid conclusion based on the premise given.
  Option D concludes that the neighbors pay rent on their house just because they do not own it, which is a valid conclusion based on the premise given.
  Option E concludes that the neighbors pay rent on their house just because they do not own it, which is a valid conclusion based on the premise given.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument assumes that receiving a poor performance evaluation is the only reason someone would not receive a raise.
Thought:
  The argument above assumes that there is only one reason why someone would not receive a raise, which is receiving a poor performance evaluation.
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why someone did not receive a raise.
  For example, the company may not have had enough funds to give out raises that year.
  This flawed reasoning is most similar to the reasoning in choice E.
  Choice E assumes that anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it, which is not necessarily true.
  There could be other reasons why someone who lives in a house does not own it, such as living in a house that is owned by a family member.

  Lester has not received a raise.
  Therefore, Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  The argument assumes that receiving a poor performance evaluation is the only reason someone would not receive a raise.
  This is flawed reasoning because there could be other reasons why someone did not receive a raise.
  For example, the company may not have the funds to give raises, or the employee may not have been employed for a full year yet.
  The flawed reasoning in the argument is most similar to the reasoning in choice E.
  Choice E assumes that anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it, which is not necessarily true.
  There could be other reasons why someone who lives in a house does not own it, such as inheriting it or living in a house provided by their employer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that since Lester has not received a raise, he must have received a poor performance evaluation.
Thought:
  The argument assumes that there are only two possible outcomes: receiving a raise or receiving a poor performance evaluation.

  Therefore, the argument is flawed because it ignores other possible reasons why someone might not receive a raise.
  The flawed reasoning in this argument is most similar to the reasoning in option E.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The argument is that no one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester has not received a raise, so it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation.
  A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
  B: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  C: My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house. Since anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own it.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  For a contract to be valid, one party must accept a legitimate offer from the other.

Thought: 
  Option A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
    This argument assumes that Sandy did not believe the offer to be made in jest. The principle stated in the context helps to justify this assumption. Therefore, this argument is supported by the principle.
  Option B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
    This argument assumes that Kenta would not have reasonably believed the offer to be made in jest. The principle stated in the context helps to justify this assumption. Therefore, this argument is supported by the principle.
  Option C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
    This argument does not involve the issue of whether an offer is legitimate or not. Therefore, the principle stated in the context is not relevant to this argument.
  Option D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
    This argument assumes that Lea would not have reasonably believed the offer to be made in jest. The principle stated in the context helps to justify this assumption. Therefore, this argument is supported by the principle.
  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
    This argument assumes that the offer made by Sal was not legitimate. The principle stated in the context is not relevant to this argument.
Criticism: 
  The principle stated in the context is relevant only to the issue of whether an offer is legitimate or not. It does not address other issues that may affect the validity of a contract, such as the capacity of the parties to enter into a contract, the legality of the subject matter, or the adequacy of consideration. Therefore, the principle is not sufficient to justify the validity of a contract in all cases.

  Option E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
    This argument assumes that the offer was not legitimate. The principle stated in the context does not help to justify this assumption. Therefore, this argument is not supported by the principle.
Criticism: 
  The principle stated in the context is about the legitimacy of an offer, not the acceptance of an offer. Therefore, options A and B are not entirely accurate in their use of the principle.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other.
  An offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Thought: 
  The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A does not mention anything about the offer being made in jest, so it is not relevant to the principle.
  Option B mentions that Gus made the offer in jest, which would make the offer not legitimate according to the principle.
  Option C mentions that Frank's offer was legitimate, but it does not mention anything about the offer being made in jest, so it is not relevant to the principle.
  Option D mentions that Hai's offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, so the offer would be legitimate according to the principle.
  Option E mentions that the offer was not legitimate, but it does not mention anything about the offer being made in jest, so it is not relevant to the principle.
  Therefore, the principle most helps to justify the reasoning in option B.
  The answer is B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the premise that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that challenges this premise.
  A: This option does not challenge the premise of the argument. It actually supports the premise by stating that the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: This option suggests that the joggers who previously had injuries experienced difficulty in performing stretches. This could mean that the group that stretched before jogging was not able to stretch properly, which could have affected the results of the study. This weakens the argument.
  C: This option suggests that most jogging injuries result from mishaps on which stretching would have little effect. This does not challenge the premise of the argument.
  D: This option suggests that the more prone a jogger is to injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging. This does not challenge the premise of the argument.
  E: This option suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise. This does not challenge the premise of the argument.
  Option B is the best answer as it challenges the premise of the argument by suggesting that the group that stretched before jogging was not able to stretch properly, which could have affected the results of the study.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the comparison of two groups of joggers, one that stretches before jogging and one that does not.
  If there is a flaw in the comparison, it could weaken the argument.
  A: This statement does not weaken the argument. It is possible that both groups of joggers had a lower rate of jogging injuries than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: This statement weakens the argument. If many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches, it could explain why the group that stretches before jogging did not have fewer injuries.
  C: This statement does not weaken the argument. Even if most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps, it is still possible that stretching before jogging could help prevent some injuries.
  D: This statement does not weaken the argument. Even if the more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging, it is still possible that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries.
  E: This statement weakens the argument. If studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise, it suggests that stretching before jogging could be beneficial.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  A: This statement provides additional information about the rate of jogging injuries during the study, but it does not address the effectiveness of stretching before jogging.
  B: This statement suggests that some joggers may have difficulty performing stretches, but it does not address the effectiveness of stretching before jogging.
  C: This statement suggests that stretching may not be effective for preventing certain types of jogging injuries, but it does not address the effectiveness of stretching before jogging.
  D: This statement suggests that joggers who are more prone to injuries may be more likely to stretch before jogging, but it does not address the effectiveness of stretching before jogging.
  E: This statement suggests that stretching may be effective for certain forms of exercise, but it does not address the effectiveness of stretching before jogging.
Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  If stretching before jogging is shown to be effective in preventing some injuries, then the researcher's argument would be weakened.
  Therefore, the correct answer should provide evidence that stretching before jogging can be effective in preventing some injuries.
  Choice E suggests that stretching can be effective in preventing injuries for certain forms of exercise.
  Therefore, Choice E would most weaken the medical researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought: 
  The medical researcher compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging.
  Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  Therefore, the medical researcher concluded that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that shows that stretching before jogging may help to prevent injuries.
  Option A states that the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries for both groups of joggers compared by the scientists.
  This option does not weaken the medical researcher's argument.
  Option B states that many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  This option does not weaken the medical researcher's argument.
  Option C states that most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  This option weakens the medical researcher's argument by suggesting that stretching may help to prevent injuries resulting from falls, collisions, and other mishaps.
  Option D states that the more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  This option does not weaken the medical researcher's argument.
  Option E states that studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
  This option weakens the medical researcher's argument by suggesting that stretching may help to prevent injuries resulting from jogging.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher compared a group of joggers who stretch before jogging to a group of joggers who do not stretch before jogging.
  Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  The conclusion is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought: 
  We need to find an option that weakens the medical researcher's argument.
  Option A states that the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries for both groups of joggers compared by the scientists.
  This means that both groups of joggers had fewer injuries than expected, which could be due to the study's design.
  Option B is talking about joggers who previously injured themselves while jogging and experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  This does not weaken the argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  Option C states that most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  This option weakens the argument because it suggests that stretching may not prevent injuries caused by falls or collisions, but it could still help prevent other types of injuries.
  Option D suggests that the more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  This does not weaken the argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  Option E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
  This does not weaken the argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  Therefore, the best option that weakens the medical researcher's argument is C.
Action: Answer("C")

Knowledge:
  The medical researcher compared joggers who stretch before jogging to joggers who do not stretch before jogging.
  Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  The researcher concluded that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought:
  The argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A states that the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries for both groups of joggers compared by the scientists.
  This suggests that both groups of joggers were less prone to injury than the general population of joggers.
  Therefore, the fact that both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries may not be a good indicator of the effectiveness of stretching.
  Option A weakens the medical researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher compared a group of joggers who stretch before jogging to a group of joggers who do not stretch before jogging.
  Both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  The researcher concludes that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries because both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an option that suggests stretching before jogging may help prevent injuries.
  Option E suggests that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
  If jogging is one of those forms of exercise, then this option would weaken the researcher's argument.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this thought process.

Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is based on the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this fact or provides an alternative explanation for it.
  A: This statement does not weaken the argument because it does not address the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries.
  B: This statement weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. If many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches, then the group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging would be more likely to incur injuries, which would make the fact that both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries less surprising.
  C: This statement weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the fact that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. If most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect, then the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries would be limited, which would make the fact that both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries less surprising.
  D: This statement does not weaken the argument because it does not address the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries.
  E: This statement does not weaken the argument because it does not address the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries for jogging.
Criticism: 
  The analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

  The medical researcher compared joggers who stretch before jogging to joggers who do not stretch before jogging.
  Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
  The researcher concluded that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Thought:
  The argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that suggests that stretching before jogging may help to prevent injuries.
  A: This option does not weaken the argument.
  B: This option suggests that stretching may help to prevent injuries, but it does not directly weaken the argument.
  C: This option suggests that stretching may not help to prevent injuries, but it does not directly weaken the argument.
  D: This option does not weaken the argument.
  E: This option suggests that stretching may help to prevent injuries, and it weakens the argument.
  If stretching can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise, then it is possible that stretching before jogging can also help to prevent injuries.
  Therefore, option E weakens the argument the most.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the fact that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  A: The argument concludes that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays based on the fact that most of the paintings on display are from the twentieth century while most of the paintings the museum owns are from the nineteenth century.
  B: The argument concludes that most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks based on the fact that more residents said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than on parks.
  C: The argument concludes that there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species in the San Felipe area based on the fact that most of the trees in the San Felipe city arboretum are of local rather than exotic species.
  D: The argument concludes that more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo based on the fact that most of the vegetables available at Valley Food are organic while most of the vegetables available at Jumbo are not.
  E: The argument concludes that Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale based on the fact that the website has photos of most of the houses but of fewer than half of the condominiums that Acme is offering for sale.
Thought: 
  The argument above assumes that the number of students taking the class is proportional to the number of majors in each field.
  However, it is possible that a higher percentage of sociology majors choose to take the class than psychology majors, even if there are more psychology majors overall.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is most similar to that in choice B.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  The argument above assumes that the number of students taking the class is proportional to the number of majors in each field, which is not necessarily true.
  Therefore, the argument is flawed.
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is most similar to that in choice B.

D: The argument concludes that more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo based on the fact that most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not.
E: The argument concludes that Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale based on the fact that the Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.
Thought: 
The argument is flawed because it assumes that just because most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class. It is possible that there are more psychology majors than sociology majors, but for some reason, most psychology majors are not taking the class. This is similar to option B where the argument assumes that just because more Silver Falls residents are in favor of increased spending on roads than parks, most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.

Thought: 
  The argument above concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class while most of the psychology majors are not.
  This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it assumes that the proportion of sociology majors taking the class is greater than the proportion of psychology majors taking the class, which may not be true.
  This flawed pattern of reasoning is most similar to that in option B, which assumes that the proportion of Silver Falls residents in favor of spending more on roads is greater than the proportion of residents in favor of spending more on parks, which may not be true.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer.

Thought: 
  The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the proportion of sociology majors taking the class is greater than the proportion of psychology majors taking the class, without knowing the total number of students enrolled in the class.
  A: The argument above is similar to this option because it assumes that the proportion of paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum is the same as the proportion of paintings the museum owns, without knowing the total number of paintings the museum owns.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the argument above is flawed because it assumes that the proportion of sociology majors taking the class is greater than the proportion of psychology majors taking the class, without knowing the total number of students enrolled in the class.
  However, option A is not the best choice because it is not a perfect match to the flawed reasoning in the argument above. In option A, the argument assumes that the proportion of paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum is the same as the proportion of paintings the museum owns, while in the argument above, the assumption is that the proportion of sociology majors taking the class is greater than the proportion of psychology majors taking the class.

  The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the number of students enrolled in the class is directly proportional to the number of majors in each field. It is possible that there are more psychology majors enrolled in the class than sociology majors, but the psychology majors are simply not taking the class. 
  A: The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the museum does not own any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays, which may not be true.
  B: The argument above is flawed because it assumes that those who did not express an opinion are opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the arboretum is representative of the entire San Felipe area.
  D: The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the total number of vegetables available at both stores is the same.
  E: The argument above is flawed because it assumes that the number of houses and condominiums for sale is equal.

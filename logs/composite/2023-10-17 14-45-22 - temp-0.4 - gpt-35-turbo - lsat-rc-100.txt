Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?

  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss research on happiness and wealth.
  Passage A discusses two phenomena that push up the norm of income: habituation and rivalry.
  Passage A also discusses how people compare their income with some norm that must be rising along with actual income.
  Passage A states that people overinvest in acquiring material possessions at the expense of leisure.
  Passage A also states that how people compare to their "reference group" is crucial for happiness.
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful and have created value.
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss the importance of how people compare their income with others.
  Passage A discusses how people overinvest in acquiring material possessions and how their reference group is crucial for happiness.
  Passage B argues that people who earn more feel successful and have created value.
  Neither passage explicitly describes a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  However, based on the discussion of how people compare their income with others, it is likely that the authors of Passage A and Passage B would have different opinions about a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Passage A might describe this person as misguided, since overinvesting in acquiring material possessions can be detrimental to happiness and leisure.
  Passage B might describe this person as admirable, since wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness.
  Therefore, the most likely pair of terms that the authors of Passage A and Passage B would use to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors are D: misguided, admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss research on happiness and wealth.
  The authors of Passage A suggest that people compare their income with a norm that rises along with actual income, and that two phenomena - habituation and rivalry - push up the norm.
  The authors of Passage B argue that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful and have created value.
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B do not use the terms "insular," "cosmopolitan," "altruistic," "egocentric," "happy," "miserable," "misguided," "admirable," "lucky," or "primitive" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Instead, they discuss the phenomenon of rivalry and how people compare themselves to their reference group, which is crucial for happiness.
  The authors of Passage B argue that wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness.
  Therefore, we cannot determine which pair of terms would most likely be used by the authors to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses research on the relationship between happiness and wealth, and how people compare their income with some norm.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses research on the relationship between wealth and happiness, and the role of habituation and rivalry in shaping people's perceptions of their income and happiness.
  Passage B discusses the theory that people derive happiness from feeling successful and creating value, rather than from simply having more money than others.
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B both suggest that people's desire to make more money than their neighbors is driven by a desire for relative prosperity and success, rather than by a purely selfish or primitive urge to one-up others.
  Neither passage suggests that this desire is misguided or insular, nor that it is necessarily admirable or altruistic.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B are unlikely to use the terms "misguided" or "admirable" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  The authors of Passage B suggest that people who want to create value and feel successful are actually benefiting society, which suggests that they might view such people as admirable.
  However, neither passage suggests that people who want to make more money than their neighbors are necessarily altruistic or egocentric.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  Passage A discusses the paradox of wealth and happiness, and how people compare their income to a norm.
  Passage B discusses the idea that earning more makes people happier because it makes them feel successful and that they have created value.
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B do not describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors using the same terms.
  Passage A describes the phenomenon of rivalry and how people compare themselves to others to determine their happiness.
  Passage B argues that people want to create value and feel successful, which is why they want to earn more money.
  Based on this, it is unlikely that either passage would use the term "altruistic" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  It is also unlikely that either passage would use the term "primitive" to describe such a person.
  The authors of Passage A might describe such a person as "misguided" because they are focusing on relative income rather than absolute income or leisure.
  The authors of Passage B might describe such a person as "admirable" because they are driven to create value and feel successful.
  Therefore, the answer is D: misguided, admirable.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

  The answer is D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
Criticism: 
  While the passage does argue that concerns about restrictions on access to research materials are largely misguided, it does not suggest that all concerns about biotechnology patents are unfounded.
  The passage acknowledges that questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and that the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is not that all concerns about biotechnology patents are unfounded, but rather that concerns about restrictions on access to research materials are largely misguided and that patents may actually spur basic research.

Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the issue of patenting in the biotechnology industry and how it affects basic research. 
  The passage mentions that industries and researchers in the biotechnology field believe that intellectual property protection should be allowed for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. 
  The passage also mentions that some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is that there is controversy surrounding the issue of patenting in the biotechnology industry, particularly with regards to how it affects basic research. 
  The passage presents arguments from both sides of the issue, with some arguing that patents are necessary to incentivize innovation, while others argue that patents restrict access to research materials and hinder basic research. 
  The passage also notes that concerns about patent holders attempting to restrict basic research may be overblown, as patent litigation is expensive and there is a tradition of respecting a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. 
  Therefore, the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage is that there is controversy surrounding the issue of biotechnology patents and their impact on basic research.
  The answer is B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
Criticism: 
  While the passage does discuss the controversy surrounding biotechnology patents and their impact on basic research, it is not the main point of the passage. 
  The main point of the passage is that there are arguments on both sides of the issue, and that concerns about patent holders restricting basic research may be overblown. 
  Therefore, the answer should focus on the main point of the passage, rather than a specific aspect of the controversy.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale means that the bigger the factory or business, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more products the factory can produce per worker.
  The passage also mentions that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
Thought: 
  Option A describes a scenario where a publishing house is able to employ many fewer editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option B describes a scenario where a large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar. This does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option C describes a scenario where a school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time. This does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option D describes a scenario where the lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. This does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option E describes a scenario where a large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony. This illustrates increasing returns to scale because the more ants there are, the more specialized their tasks can be, and the more work the colony can accomplish per ant.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  The Pin Factory example shows how larger businesses can achieve greater efficiency and productivity through specialization of labor.
  Increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly, as larger businesses can achieve lower costs than smaller ones.
Thought: 
  Option A describes a reduction in the number of editors, not an increase in productivity through specialization of labor, so it does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option B describes how a larger bee colony can collect more nectar, but it does not involve specialization of labor or increasing returns to scale in the context of a business or industry, so it is not the best illustration of the concept.
  Option C describes a way to increase the capacity of a building, but it does not involve specialization of labor or increasing returns to scale in the context of a business or industry, so it is not the best illustration of the concept.
  Option D describes how advances in technology can increase the productivity of lobster traps, but it does not involve specialization of labor or increasing returns to scale in the context of a business or industry, so it is not the best illustration of the concept.
  Option E describes how a large ant colony can divide and produce more colonies, resulting in a larger overall population of ants. This illustrates increasing returns to scale, as the larger ant colonies can achieve greater efficiency and productivity through specialization of labor, resulting in a larger overall population of ants.
  Therefore, the best illustration of increasing returns to scale is E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.

  The lobster industry catching more lobsters with the same number of traps due to advances in technology illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that increasing returns to scale is the concept that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more products the factory can produce per worker.
  However, the lobster industry catching more lobsters with the same number of traps due to advances in technology is not the best illustration of increasing returns to scale. It is an example of technological progress.
  The best illustration of increasing returns to scale in the given options is E: A large ant colony dividing and producing two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.
  D: The innovative research methods of Katherine Dunham made possible her discovery that the dance traditions of the Caribbean were derived from earlier African dance traditions.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, specifically jazz music.
  The passage describes how the narrative structure of Jazz is similar to the structure of a jazz performance, with individual voices and improvisations within a larger framework.
Thought: 
  The author asserts that Toni Morrison has intentionally tried to simulate the style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  This assertion is based on the description of the narrative structure of Jazz and its similarities to the structure of a jazz performance.
  None of the other options address this specific assertion.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Criticism: 
  The assertion is supported by the description of the narrative structure of Jazz, but it is not explicitly stated that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  It is possible that the similarity between the structure of Jazz and the structure of a jazz performance is coincidental or subconscious.
  However, the passage does suggest that Morrison was influenced by jazz music and that the structure of Jazz reflects this influence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, specifically jazz music.
  The author notes that Morrison structured the novel to simulate the style of jazz performance, with individual characters' sections set off by quotation marks.
Thought: 
  The author is making a claim about the structure of Jazz and its similarity to the structure of jazz music.
  The claim is that the novel's structure simulates the style of jazz performance.
  The author is not claiming that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question. The passage only discusses Jazz and its connection to jazz music.
  The author is not claiming that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music. The passage only discusses Toni Morrison and Jazz.
  The author is not claiming that depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature. The passage only discusses Jazz and its connection to jazz music.
  The author is not claiming that a smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music. The passage only discusses Toni Morrison and Jazz.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism to this answer as it accurately reflects the author's claim in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, specifically jazz music.
  The author notes that Morrison uses a musical genre, jazz, as the structuring principle for the novel.
  The author compares the structure of the novel to the playing of a jazz ensemble, with individual voices and improvisations within a fixed scope.
Thought: 
  The author discusses the way in which Morrison structures her novel Jazz to mimic the structure of a jazz ensemble.
  The author notes that Morrison's use of quotation marks around characters' sections of the narrative is similar to the way in which jazz musicians perform solos within the fixed scope of a composer's frame.
  The author is making a comparison between the structure of the novel and the structure of jazz music.
  Therefore, if it were true that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question, this would most call into question the author's assertion that Morrison's novel is unique in its structure.
  The answer is C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
Criticism: 
  The author discusses the unique structure of Morrison's novel Jazz and compares it to the structure of jazz music.
  The author does not make a general claim about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists.
  Therefore, it is not accurate to say that if all novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question, this would most call into question the author's assertion that Morrison's novel is unique in its structure.

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, specifically jazz.
  The passage compares the structure of Jazz to the structure of a jazz composition, in which individual musicians improvise within the framework of the composer's vision.
Thought: 
  The author asserts that the structure of Jazz is similar to the structure of a jazz composition.
  In a jazz composition, individual musicians improvise within the framework of the composer's vision.
  In Jazz, the characters' sections are set off by quotation marks, indicating that the narrator is allowing them to speak within the framework of the overall narrative.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if it were not true that Jazz's structure is similar to the structure of a jazz composition.
  None of the answer choices directly address this point, but the closest is B: "A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music." This answer choice is not directly related to the comparison between Jazz's structure and the structure of a jazz composition, so it would not necessarily call the author's assertion into question.

Thought: 
  The author discusses the structure of Jazz and how it is similar to the structure of a jazz composition.
  The author argues that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  The author implies that this is a unique achievement in literature.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if it were shown that other novels have used a similar structure to Jazz.
  Choice C suggests that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question, but this is not directly relevant to the author's assertion about Jazz.
  Choice D suggests that all novels can be found to be somewhat musical in nature, but this is not specific to the structure of Jazz.
  Choice E discusses the prevalence of African American writers who have written novels about music, but this is not directly relevant to the author's assertion about the unique structure of Jazz.
  Therefore, the best answer is B, which suggests that other African American novelists have sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, which would suggest that Morrison's achievement in Jazz is not unique. However, the passage does not provide any evidence to support this claim.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.
Response 0:
Answer: B
Response 1:
Answer: B
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")

The passage describes two sides of a debate on how to deter deliberate crimes and introduces an economic principle to reconcile the two positions. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them." (Choice B)
Response 3:
Answer: B
Response 4:
Answer: B
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")

The organization of the passage is as follows:
  - The first paragraph introduces the debate about the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  - The second paragraph describes the two sides of the debate.
  - The third paragraph introduces the economic principle of utility maximization as a way to reconcile the two positions.
  - The fourth paragraph explains how the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect within the framework of utility maximization.
  - The fifth paragraph concludes that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them. The answer is B.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the function of the third paragraph within the passage as a whole?
Choices:
  A: to refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage B describes astronomers attempting to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but their predictions were incorrect. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune. Later, Neptune was discovered in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
Thought:
  The question asks for the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as described in Passage B.
  In Passage B, astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity to explain the discrepancy between their predicted orbit of Uranus and their observations. They called this planet Neptune, and later Neptune was discovered in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the answer is B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
Criticism:
  There is no mention of variable stars, Andromeda, or the Milky Way in Passage B, so it is not immediately clear why this would be the best answer.
  However, the episode described in B does involve scientists hypothesizing the existence of something (in this case, another galaxy) to explain a discrepancy between their predictions and observations, and later discovering that the hypothesized entity does in fact exist. This is analogous to astronomers hypothesizing the existence of Neptune to explain the discrepancy between their predicted orbit of Uranus and their observations, and later discovering that Neptune does in fact exist.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune through the prediction of its existence based on the failure of predictions of Uranus's orbit, followed by the observation of Neptune in the predicted location.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  C: Walter Alvarez's postulation of an asteroid impact causing dinosaur extinction is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of reversed magnetization in rocks is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of a third undetected particle is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune through the prediction of its existence based on the failure of predictions of Uranus's orbit, followed by the observation of Neptune in the predicted location.
  Therefore, the most analogous scientific episode would involve the prediction of an object's existence based on the failure of predictions of another object's behavior, followed by the observation of the predicted object in the predicted location.
  Choice C involves the observation of high levels of a mineral, followed by the discovery of an impact crater, which is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Choices A, B, D, and E do not involve the prediction of an object's existence based on the failure of predictions of another object's behavior.
  Therefore, none of the choices are analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct that none of the choices involve the prediction of an object's existence based on the failure of predictions of another object's behavior.
  However, the question asks for the most analogous scientific episode, not whether any of the choices are analogous.
  While none of the choices are a perfect match, choice C involves the observation of evidence that leads to the prediction of an object's existence, followed by the observation of the predicted object in the predicted location, which is somewhat analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the best answer is actually C.

  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. 
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. 
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle to explain apparent contradictions of the law of conservation of energy.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes how scientists discovered the planet Neptune by making predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. 
  They found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect and hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune. 
  Later, scientists discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations. 
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is one in which scientists make predictions based on theories and auxiliary assumptions, find that their predictions are incorrect, and hypothesize the existence of something to account for the discrepancy, which is later confirmed.
  Choice C involves a similar process, but it is not a case of making predictions based on theories and auxiliary assumptions. 
  Choice D involves a discovery that contradicts a theory, but it does not involve making predictions based on theories and auxiliary assumptions. 
  Choice E involves a postulation to explain an apparent contradiction, but it is not a case of making predictions based on theories and auxiliary assumptions. 
  Choice A involves a false prediction, but it does not involve making predictions based on theories and auxiliary assumptions, and it does not involve hypothesizing the existence of something to account for the discrepancy, which is later confirmed. 
  The best answer is B.
Criticism: 
  While Choice B involves a discovery based on observations and measurements, it does not involve making predictions based on theories and auxiliary assumptions, and it does not involve hypothesizing the existence of something to account for a discrepancy, which is later confirmed. 
  Therefore, another possible answer is None of the Above.

  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the one where scientists hypothesized the existence of an unknown planet to explain discrepancies in their predictions.
  The only option that fits this description is D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. Brunhes concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past. This hypothesis was later confirmed by the discovery of other rocks with similar magnetic properties. 
  Therefore, the answer is D.

Thought: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet, Neptune, based on observations that did not match their predictions.
  Choice A describes how Galileo's theory of tides was incorrect because it predicted only one high tide per day instead of two, which is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Choice B describes how Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right, which is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Choice C describes how Walter Alvarez postulated an asteroid impact causing dinosaur extinction based on observations of high levels of iridium, which is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.

  Choice E describes how Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of an undetected particle to explain the apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy, which is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, none of the choices are analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  However, if we had to choose the most analogous one, it would be A since it also involves an incorrect prediction based on a theory.

Criticism: 
  The analogy between the discovery of Neptune and Walter Alvarez's postulation of an asteroid impact causing dinosaur extinction is not strong.
  In the case of Neptune, scientists hypothesized the existence of another planet to explain an anomaly and later discovered that planet in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  In the case of Alvarez's postulation, scientists hypothesized the existence of an asteroid impact to explain an anomaly and later discovered evidence of a large impact crater that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  The two situations are not perfectly analogous, but C is still the best answer among the options provided.

  The most analogous scientific episode would be one where scientists predicted the existence of a previously unknown entity based on the observed effects of its presence, and later discovered that entity in the predicted location.
  The discovery of a new galaxy or a new particle does not involve predicting its existence based on the observed effects of its presence, so they are not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  The discovery of the cause of dinosaur extinction or the reversal of Earth's magnetic field does not involve predicting the existence of a previously unknown entity, so they are not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune is A: Galileo's theory of tides, which falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two. This is because Galileo's theory was based on observed effects of the tides, and the discovery of the correct explanation involved hypothesizing the existence of an unknown entity (the moon) in the predicted location, based on the observed effects of its presence.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between the discovery of Neptune and Galileo's theory of tides is not perfect. Galileo's theory was based on a misunderstanding of the observed effects of the tides, whereas the prediction of Neptune was based on a correct understanding of the observed orbit of Uranus. Additionally, the discovery of Neptune involved a more rigorous and systematic approach to hypothesis testing and confirmation than the discovery of the moon as the cause of the tides. However, among the given choices, Galileo's theory of tides is the closest analogy to the discovery of Neptune.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.

  E: The author briefly mentions unforeseeable collisions with asteroids as an example of a risk that is completely involuntary, but does not discuss natural disasters in general.
Thought: 
  The author argues that determining whether a risk is voluntarily incurred is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree, and that notions of voluntariness should serve as proxies for more specific considerations. The author also argues that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement D, which reflects these arguments.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks.
  The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind.
Thought:
  The author argues that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary."
  Regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  The government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that focuses on saving as many lives as possible.
  The statement that best aligns with the author's argument is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
Criticism:
  None.

Thought:
- The author argues against the usefulness of the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk.
- The author suggests that policy decisions should be guided by saving as many lives as possible, subject to limited resources.
- Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that supports this view.
- Choice A suggests that people should not be protected against risks incurred through dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose. The author does not explicitly state this view.
- Choice B suggests that policy experts would deem the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly as largely irrelevant to decisions about regulating air safety. The author does not suggest this view.
- Choice C provides information about the probability of occurrence and resulting death or injury for plane crashes, but the author does not express agreement or disagreement with this statement.
- Choice D suggests that a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. The author argues against the usefulness of the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk, so this statement is unlikely to be the one the author agrees with.
- Choice E suggests that the main category of risk that is usually incurred involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster. The author does not express agreement or disagreement with this statement.
- Therefore, the best answer is A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose. The author argues against the usefulness of the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk and suggests that policy decisions should be guided by saving as many lives as possible, subject to limited resources.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  The ozone layer screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  Stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time in the absence of pollutants.
  Manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  CFCs release chlorine in the upper atmosphere, which destroys ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
Thought: 
  The passage provides information on the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer and the resulting increase in skin cancer risk due to the depletion of the ozone layer.
  A: The passage does not suggest that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present. It states that in the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium.
  B: The passage does not suggest that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light. It states that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer and that the ozone layer screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  C: The passage does not suggest that few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere. It states that CFCs are highly volatile chemicals that chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  D: The passage suggests that regulating the use of CFCs contributes directly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer by reducing the depletion of the ozone layer, which screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  E: The passage does not suggest that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica. It states that Molina and Rowland's views were corroborated by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, which led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.

Thought: 
  The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to the release of CFCs into the atmosphere.
  CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, in the stratosphere, which can destroy the ozone and regenerate the chlorine atoms.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Therefore, the use of CFCs contributes directly to the destruction of the ozone layer and indirectly to the increase in skin cancer incidence due to the decrease in the effectiveness of the ozone layer as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The passage does not mention that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present, so A is incorrect.
  The passage mentions that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer, but it does not state that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light, so B is incorrect.
  The passage does not mention any other chemicals besides CFCs that can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere, so C is incorrect.
  The passage supports the idea that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer, as the depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs can lead to an increase in skin cancer incidence, and the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which banned the production of ozone-depleting gases, led to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals, so D is correct.
  The passage mentions the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, but it does not state that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica, so E is incorrect.

Knowledge:
- Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
- The ozone layer screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
- Manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
- CFCs were used in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants.
- CFCs diffuse upward into the stratosphere and break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine.
- Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
- Molina and Rowland's research led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.

Thought:
- The passage discusses the depletion of the ozone layer due to the release of CFCs, which chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception
  D: questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence
  E: countering a revolutionary hypothesis
Response 0:

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans, particularly FMRI scans, in psychology research.
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI scan depicts the differential rate of oxygen use, which is obtained by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
Thought: 
  The FMRI scan is interpreted by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement. 
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  Therefore, the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is most analogous to choice B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Criticism: 
  Choice B is not a very good analogy, because it describes a situation where an advertising campaign only affected a specific group of shoppers during a specific time period. 
  This analogy does not capture the idea that the FMRI scan gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  A better analogy might be a map of a city that only shows the major roads and highways, but obscures the smaller streets and alleys. 
  This would be similar to how the FMRI scan only shows the areas of the brain that are most active during a specific task, but obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans, particularly FMRI scans, to study mental activity.
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI scan depicts the differential rate of oxygen use by subtracting a baseline measurement in the control condition from a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
Thought: 
  The FMRI scan is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The FMRI scan depicts the differential rate of oxygen use by subtracting a baseline measurement in the control condition from a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The reasoning behind this method is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is most analogous to option B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Criticism: 
  The analogy in option B is not a perfect match to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  The analogy in option B describes a situation where an advertising campaign affected only summer shoppers, while the interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with a cognitive task.
  However, there is no perfect analogy in the choices provided, and option B is the closest match to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to measure metabolic activity in the brain.
  FMRI scans are interpreted by taking a baseline measurement and then subtracting it from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The resulting image is thought to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
Thought:
  The interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to isolate the metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task.
  This is analogous to subtracting the amount of water used by residential customers from the total amount of water used to determine the amount used by agricultural customers.
  Therefore, the most analogous choice is C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
Criticism:
  The analogy between FMRI scans and water usage is not perfect.
  The passage describes how the entire brain is active in both conditions, which is different from how the total water supply is used by both residential and agricultural customers.
  A better analogy might be to a recipe that calls for subtracting the weight of a mixing bowl from the weight of the ingredients to determine the weight of the ingredients alone.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans, particularly FMRI scans, to study mental activity.
  FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain during a cognitive task, after subtracting out the baseline measurement.
Thought: 
  The question is asking for an analogy to the manner in which FMRI scans are typically interpreted. 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting out the baseline measurement and looking at the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain during a cognitive task.
  Therefore, the correct answer should describe a situation where a particular measure is obtained by subtracting out a baseline measurement and looking at the difference.
  A, B, C, and D do not involve subtracting out a baseline measurement to obtain a difference.
  E involves comparing the cheetah's speed over short and long distances, but it does not involve subtracting out a baseline measurement to obtain a difference.
  None of the choices seem to be a good analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  However, the closest analogy is E, as it involves comparing one measure (the cheetah's speed) over two different conditions (short vs. long distances).
Criticism: 
  The analogy in E is not a perfect match for the interpretation of FMRI scans, as it does not involve subtracting out a baseline measurement.
  None of the choices are a good match for the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology and the modular theory of mind.
  FMRI is a research method that produces images of the brain at work by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while a subject performs a cognitive task.
  The resulting image is interpreted as showing the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while a subject performs a cognitive task.
  The resulting image shows only the metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The interpretation of the FMRI scan is analogous to the interpretation of data that shows a difference between two conditions, while ignoring the fact that there are similarities between the two conditions.
  Choice A is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice B is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice C is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice D is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice E is analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans because it describes a situation where a particular characteristic is true only under specific conditions, but not under others.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between the interpretation of FMRI scans and choice E is not perfect.
  Choice E describes a situation where a particular characteristic is true only under specific conditions, but not under others.
  The interpretation of FMRI scans is more complex because it involves subtracting one measurement from another.

  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity, but actually depict the differential rate of oxygen use. 
  The subtractive method used in interpreting FMRI scans obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity, but actually depict the differential rate of oxygen use. 
  The subtractive method used in interpreting FMRI scans obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The question asks for an analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Option A describes a situation where one particular district voted for a mayor by an unusually large margin, making it a key factor in the mayor's victory. This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Option B describes a store that launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, suggesting that the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Option C describes a situation where much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur. This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.

  None of the options seem to be analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  The closest option is B, but it is not a good analogy.
Criticism: 
  None of the options are good analogies to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  The question may be flawed.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans to study mental activity.
  The FMRI is a type of brain scan that measures metabolic activity.
  The FMRI produces a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The FMRI subtracts a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task.
  The resulting image is interpreted as showing the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought: 
  The FMRI subtracts a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task.
  The resulting image is interpreted as showing the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method is analogous to subtracting out the activity in a particular district to determine the outcome of an election.
  For example, if a candidate wins by a large margin in one district, it can be assumed that the candidate could not have won without that district.
  Therefore, the most analogous choice is A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
Criticism: 
  The passage discusses the FMRI method of brain scanning and how it is interpreted.
  It does not discuss elections or districts, so the analogy to choice A is not strong.
  The passage describes how the FMRI subtracts a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task.
  This is similar to subtracting out the activity of one group to determine the impact of an advertising campaign, as in choice B.
  Therefore, choice B is a better analogy than choice A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise on which the validity of neuroimaging in psychology depends.
  The FMRI is a type of brain scan that produces images of the brain at work by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The subtractive method used in FMRI scans obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Thought: 
  The FMRI scan produces images of the brain at work by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The reasoning is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is most analogous to choice B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Criticism: 
  Choice B is not a perfect analogy for the interpretation of FMRI scans, as it describes a situation where an advertising campaign affects only a certain group of shoppers during a certain time period, whereas the FMRI scan is subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the task.
  However, the analogy is still the most fitting of the choices provided, as it involves isolating a specific effect from a larger set of data.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology and how it depends on the modular theory of mind, which may not be valid.
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI scan depicts the differential rate of oxygen use by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task, which gives a differential rate of oxygen use.
  The reasoning behind this method is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  However, this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the most analogous choice is one in which a specific subset is identified as being responsible for a particular outcome, while ignoring the fact that other factors are also at play.
  Choice A is not analogous because it discusses a specific district that was crucial to a candidate winning an election.
  Choice B is not analogous because it discusses an advertising campaign that only affected summer shoppers, not all shoppers.
  Choice C is not analogous because it discusses the impact of droughts on the agricultural sector versus the residential sector, not the identification of a specific subset responsible for a particular outcome.
  Choice D is not analogous because it discusses the origin of Internet traffic during peak hours, not the identification of a specific subset responsible for a particular outcome.
  Choice E is not analogous because it discusses the limitations of cheetahs in outrunning other animals over long distances, not the identification of a specific subset responsible for a particular outcome.
  Therefore, none of the choices are analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of FMRI scans to study brain activity.
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  This subtraction is used to identify areas of the brain that are active during the cognitive task.
Thought:
  The interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during a cognitive task.
  This subtraction is used to identify areas of the brain that are active during the cognitive task.
  This is analogous to subtracting out the water used by residential customers from the total water supply to determine the impact of droughts on the agricultural sector.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
Criticism:

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The second version of multicultural education advocates for a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.

  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The second proposal argues for a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures.
  Critics of this second proposal argue that the Western scientific methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are already value-laden.
Thought: 
  The critics argue that the Western scientific methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are already value-laden.
  The Western scientific heritage prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  The discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures.
  To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.
  Therefore, critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The second proposal holds that multicultural education should adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of this second proposal argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden.
Thought:
  The critics of the second proposal believe that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  They argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value-laden, and that the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  Therefore, the critics would be most likely to agree with choice E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal advocates for teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture.
  The second proposal advocates for taking each culture on its own terms, without imposing the values of the majority culture.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that using Western scientific methods to study other cultures is still problematic.
Thought:
  The critics of the second proposal argue that Western scientific methods are value-laden and cannot fully capture the values and perspectives of non-Western cultures.
  Therefore, they would most likely agree with the idea that the social and historical circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")

The main point of the passage is that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants are largely due to an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. The passage describes how secondary substances in plants have developed as a result of genetic mutations, and how natural selection has favored those substances that have helped plants defend themselves against insect enemies or attract pollinating insects. The passage also describes how insects have evolved to circumvent plant defenses and how this has led to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant. Therefore, the best answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins
  B: endorse a claim simply because it is widely believed
  C: accept a claim for the sake of argument

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the attitude of Matthew Arnold toward the aristocratic and middle classes can best be described as one of
Choices:
  A: respect
  B: empathy
  C: indifference
  D: disappointment
  E: scorn

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.

  E: "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone not from the Border region.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
Thought: 
  The question asks which of the given scenarios would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  All of the scenarios involve some form of rational economic decision-making.
  A: The waiter's decision to conceal his tip income is a rational response to the economic incentive of reducing his taxes, even though it involves breaking the law.
  B: The motorist's decision to avoid speeding is a rational response to the economic disincentive of losing her driver's license, even though it involves sacrificing time.
  C: The industrialist's decision to continue to illegally discharge pollutants is a rational response to the economic disincentive of the high cost of treatment, even though it involves breaking the law.
  D: The government official's decision to solicit bribes is a rational response to the economic disincentive of an inadequate salary, even though it involves breaking the law.
  E: The worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor is not a rational response to any economic incentive or disincentive. It is an impulsive crime of passion.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the historical production of art by and for political and social elites, and the two different ways this was done.
  It also discusses the preferences and tastes of different classes of elites and their impact on the kind of art produced.
  The passage also mentions the challenges faced by sociohistorical critics in analyzing the relationship between art and elite ideology.
Thought: 
  The passage presents multiple ideas about the production of art by and for political and social elites, and the challenges faced by sociohistorical critics in analyzing this relationship.
  However, the main point of the passage seems to be that there have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them, and that sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Criticism: 
  This seems to be the most accurate summary of the main point of the passage, as it captures the key ideas presented and their relationship to each other.
Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism
  D: admiration for its subtle critique of contemporary culture
  E: appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. 
  The author also argues that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. 
Thought: 
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
  A: This statement suggests that larger businesses do not always dominate smaller businesses in every region, which could undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. However, the statement does not address the fact that larger businesses still have an advantage in achieving lower costs and higher productivity due to increasing returns to scale.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  C: This statement reinforces the idea that larger businesses can exert monopoly power, which supports the author's argument.
  D: This statement suggests that the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale varies by industry, which could weaken the connection between increased size and monopoly power. However, it does not address the fact that larger businesses still have an advantage in achieving lower costs and higher productivity due to increasing returns to scale.
  E: This statement suggests that there are other factors that can offset the gains in productivity achieved by increasing specialization, which could undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. However, it does not address the fact that larger businesses still have an advantage in achieving lower costs and higher productivity due to increasing returns to scale.
  Based on the above analysis, none of the options undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increased size and specialization, which can lead to increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which is opposed to the idea of the Invisible Hand.
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which undermines the idea of the Invisible Hand.
  To undermine this connection, we need to find an option that suggests that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power.
  A: This option suggests that larger businesses do not always have monopoly power, but it does not explain why increasing returns to scale would not lead to monopoly power.
  B: This option is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  C: This option suggests that larger businesses collude to set prices, which is a form of monopoly power.
  D: This option suggests that the size necessary to achieve increasing returns to scale varies by industry, but it does not explain why increasing returns to scale would not lead to monopoly power.
  E: This option suggests that there are offsetting factors that limit the benefits of increased specialization, which could limit the tendency toward monopoly power.
Criticism:
  Option A is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option B is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option C suggests that larger businesses collude to set prices, which is a form of monopoly power.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power and undermine the invisible hand's ability to promote competition.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the answer that would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  A: This answer choice does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it acknowledges that some businesses can exert monopoly power despite larger businesses in other regions.
  B: This answer choice is not relevant to the argument about increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
  C: This answer choice actually reinforces the argument that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power, as it suggests that businesses collude to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: This answer choice does not undermine the argument, as it acknowledges that the size needed to achieve increasing returns to scale varies from industry to industry.
  E: This answer choice does not undermine the argument, as it suggests that there are offsetting factors that limit the gains in productivity achieved through increased specialization.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory represents increasing returns to scale, which can lead to monopoly power.
  The Invisible Hand relies on many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The connection between increased size and monopoly power is undermined if there are other factors that prevent monopoly power.
  Option A suggests that there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  This suggests that size alone is not enough to achieve monopoly power.
  Therefore, Option A would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory represents the idea that there are increasing returns to scale, which can lead to natural monopoly.
  The Invisible Hand represents the idea that self-interest can lead to the common good in a competitive marketplace.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the idea of the Invisible Hand working properly depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  If there are industries where increasing returns to scale do not lead to natural monopoly, this would undermine the author's argument.
  Answer choice A suggests that there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  This suggests that there are factors other than size that can influence monopoly power.
  Therefore, answer choice A would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the huge increases in efficiency that can be achieved through increased size.
  Increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  The Invisible Hand works properly when there are many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which undermines the connection between increased size and the Invisible Hand.
  To undermine this connection, we need to find an option that suggests that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power.
  A suggests that even larger businesses can be dominated by smaller businesses in certain regions, which weakens the argument that increasing returns to scale always lead to monopoly power.
  B, C, and E are irrelevant to the argument.
  D suggests that the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, which could mean that not all industries will experience the natural tendency toward monopoly that the author describes.
  D weakens the argument that increasing returns to scale always lead to monopoly power.
  Therefore, D is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly, where bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players.

Thought:
The question asks which statement would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power. 
A: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it acknowledges that there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
B: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it is discussing the impact of specialization on worker salaries, not on the relationship between size and monopoly power.
C: This statement supports the author's argument that natural monopoly can arise when an industry is dominated by only a few players who collude to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
D: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it acknowledges that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
E: This statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it suggests that there are other factors that can offset the gains in productivity achieved by making workers more specialized, but it does not directly address the relationship between size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, while the invisible hand requires many competitors in each industry.
Thought: 
  The author's argument is based on the assumption that increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power, which is undermined if there are other factors that prevent monopoly power from arising.
  A: This statement suggests that there are other factors that can prevent larger businesses from exerting monopoly power, which undermines the author's argument.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the author's argument about increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
  C: This statement reinforces the author's argument that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power.
  D: This statement suggests that the relationship between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power is not uniform across industries, but it does not undermine the author's argument.
  E: This statement suggests that there are other factors that can offset the benefits of increasing returns to scale, but it does not undermine the author's argument.
Criticism: 
  Choice A is plausible, but it is not clear whether the businesses that exert monopoly power in one region are actually larger than those in other regions. 
  Choice C reinforces the author's argument, rather than undermining it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the huge increases in efficiency that can be achieved through increased size and specialization.
  The Invisible Hand recognizes how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good.
  Increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, but the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry.
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale tend to drive smaller firms out of business, leading to monopoly power.
  However, if there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions, then the connection between increased size and monopoly power is not as strong as the author suggests.
  Therefore, A could undermine the author's argument.
Criticism: 
  A does not directly address the relationship between increased size and monopoly power, but rather suggests that there are other factors that can lead to monopoly power.
  B, C, D, and E do not address the relationship between increased size and monopoly power at all.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly because larger firms can achieve lower costs than smaller firms.
  The author also argues that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice A describes a situation where larger businesses in some regions are not able to exert monopoly power, which does not undermine the author's argument that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Choice B describes a situation where workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks, which is not relevant to the author's argument.
  Choice C describes a situation where businesses collude to set prices as high as a true monopoly would, which supports the author's argument that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Choice D describes a situation where the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, which does not undermine the author's argument that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Choice E describes a situation where gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover, which does not undermine the author's argument that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Therefore, none of the choices undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the political diversity and activism of Mexican Americans in the United States between 1930 and 1960.
  The author argues that the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period is unclear.
  The author also notes that patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, are important variables that may account for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the relationship between rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization and ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans is unclear.
  The passage also suggests that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States does not necessarily result in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide direct support for answer choice D.
  While the passage does suggest that the degree to which the views of Mexican American activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population at large is unclear, it does not specifically address the influence of Mexican American leaders over the population.

  The passage suggests that the degree to which the views of Mexican American activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population as a whole is unclear.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that there were differences in opinion among Mexican American groups during this period, which implies that there was not a uniform ethnic consciousness.
  The passage suggests that the degree to which the views of Mexican American activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population as a whole is unclear, which implies that it is difficult to make generalizations about ethnic consciousness.
  The passage does not provide evidence to support the claim that ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase, or that ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  The passage does suggest, however, that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization may account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  The passage also suggests that variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large may account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Criticism: 
  While the passage does suggest that variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders may account for variations in ethnic consciousness, it does not provide evidence to support this claim.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.

  The passage suggests that Dunham's approach to research, which involved participating in the dances herself, was successful.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to disagree with the colleagues' advice and argue that Dunham's approach was more effective.
  Choice C suggests that the colleagues were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, which is similar to the author's likely position.
  Therefore, the answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Criticism: 
  None.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the economic efficiency and convenience of digital publishing and how it eliminates certain costs associated with traditional publishing.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.

Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon

Thought: 
  Passage A describes disturbing forces as one of the auxiliary premises that scientists may appeal to when deriving a theory's predictions.
  Passage B describes the astronomers' attempts to predict Uranus's orbit using auxiliary assumptions, including the assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When their predictions were incorrect, the astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets.
  This change in assumptions suggests that the original assumption about the absence of planets in the vicinity of Uranus was a disturbing force that affected their predictions.

  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the subsequent attempts by astronomers to predict its orbit. They used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to make their predictions. 
  The astronomers' predictions were incorrect, and they hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they called Neptune, to account for the discrepancy.

Thought: 
  Passage A discusses how auxiliary premises are necessary for scientific predictions, and that when an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. 
  Passage B describes how astronomers used auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus, and when their predictions were incorrect, they hypothesized the existence of another planet, Neptune, to account for the discrepancy. 
  This suggests that the incorrect prediction may have been due to a false auxiliary assumption, such as the assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. 
  The question asks which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A. A disturbing force is not explicitly defined in the question or the passages, but it is mentioned in passage A as one of the possible auxiliary premises that scientists may appeal to when deriving a theory's predictions. 
  None of the answer choices are clearly related to a disturbing force, so we need to eliminate the ones that are not related to the passages. 
  Uranus, the sun, Neptune, and Mercury are all mentioned in passage B, but the moon is not. 
  The passage discusses auxiliary assumptions, but does not mention disturbing forces explicitly. 
  However, the incorrect prediction of the orbit of Uranus could be seen as a kind of disturbing force, in that it disturbed the astronomers' assumptions and led them to hypothesize the existence of another planet. 
  Therefore, we can select A: Uranus as the answer. 
Criticism: 
  The question is somewhat vague in its use of the term "disturbing force," which is not defined in the passages. 
  The answer choice A: Uranus is a plausible answer, but it is not explicitly described as a disturbing force in the passages. 
  It is possible that a different answer choice could also be considered correct, depending on how one interprets the term "disturbing force." 
Action: Answer("A")

  In Passage B, the astronomers made predictions about Uranus's orbit based on auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. 
  When their predictions were incorrect, they changed their assumptions to include the existence of another planet, which was later discovered and named Neptune. 
  This suggests that one of the auxiliary assumptions was false, and therefore could be considered a disturbing force. 
  The other planets listed in the answer choices (A, B, D, and E) do not seem to be relevant to the discussion of disturbing forces in either passage. 
  Neptune (C) is the most relevant to the discussion of auxiliary assumptions and the discovery of another planet, which could be considered a disturbing force. 
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism:

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.

  You are correct that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  However, the passage does not provide enough information to infer whether Dostoyevsky would agree or disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position in the debate about Russian literary criticism.
  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday.
  The radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  He believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
Thought:

  He believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.

Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position in the debate on Russian literary criticism.
  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday.
  The radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source.
  For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of literature.
  He believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Therefore, he would most likely disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  The answer is D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of literature.
  However, the passage does not suggest that he would disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy. 
  In fact, the passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that the fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real.
  So, the correct answer is A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on literature and its role in society.
  A: The view that art should have a strong element of the fantastic is mentioned as part of Dostoyevsky's own position, not the position of the critics in question.
  B: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky would agree with this statement, as he believed that reality was more than just the tangible and that the fantastic was intimately bound up with the real.
  C: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was a crucial source for literature, but he also believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it and that the boundaries of the real world should be exploded.
  D: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was more than just the tangible and that the fantastic was intimately bound up with the real, so he may have agreed with this statement to some extent.
  E: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the idea that art must serve a particular political view or be useful to society.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky took a realist position on literature and believed that reality was a crucial source for it.
  However, he also believed that reality was more than just the tangible and that the fantastic was intimately bound up with the real.
  Therefore, he may have agreed with the statement that art should stand high above the present and everyday because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  He would likely disagree with the idea that art must serve a particular political view or be useful to society.
  So, the answer is B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.

  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday.
  The radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  For Dostoyevsky, reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.

  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday, as it would limit the writer's ability to explore reality.
  The answer is not A because Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality included the fantastic, but this does not necessarily mean he would agree that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.
  The answer is not B because while Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, it does not necessarily mean he would agree that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.
  The answer is not C because while Dostoyevsky believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, it does not necessarily mean he would agree that reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  The answer is not D because Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality included the fantastic, but this does not necessarily mean he would agree that there should be no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  The answer is E because Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," and would therefore disagree with the view that art should further some societal end.

  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky's position on the role of literature in society was different from the radical critics.
  He believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but that reality was deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  He did not agree with the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" because reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.

  Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  The view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday would likely be acceptable to Dostoyevsky because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.

Criticism: 
  None.

  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and the everyday because they did not recognize the importance of the fantastic and the deeper understanding of reality that Dostoyevsky believed in.
  The answer is A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
Criticism:
  The answer is not entirely correct because the passage does not explicitly mention whether Dostoyevsky agreed or disagreed with the view that art should have a strong element of the fantastic.
  However, the passage does mention that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?

Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session

Thought: 
  The passage discusses the use of the economic principle of utility maximization to reconcile the two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  Therefore, the answer must identify a scenario where a principle or concept from one field is used to help explain or support an argument in another field.
  A: This scenario describes an astronomer using a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies. This scenario is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  B: This scenario describes a drawing instructor using a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other. This scenario is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  C: This scenario describes a botanist using a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest. This scenario is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  D: This scenario describes a judge using evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. This scenario is somewhat similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate, as both involve using concepts or evidence from one field to support an argument in another field. However, the use of evidence from anthropology is not the same as the use of an economic principle to reconcile two positions in a legal debate.
  E: This scenario describes a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session. This scenario is not similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.

Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a debate in the legal community about the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  One side of the debate believes that societal norms and institutions influence individuals to commit crimes, while the other side believes that the decision to commit a crime is primarily the result of individual choice.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced the economic principle of utility maximization, which holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
Thought: 
  The utility maximization principle is used by some legal scholars to reconcile the two sides of the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle states that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  A person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  The two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect because they both affect the utility equation.
  The scenario that is most similar to this use of the utility maximization principle is one in which a principle from one field is used to help explain a phenomenon in another field.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.

  Physicists discovered nuclear fission by bombarding uranium with neutrons between 1934 and 1939.
  Before this discovery, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Researchers compiling evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved did not recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
Thought: 
  Physicists did not recognize that they were witnessing nuclear fission because they were not receptive to the possibility that it might happen in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments.
  They also had particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  Therefore, if physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they would have been more likely to realize that atoms were being split.
  The answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.

  The answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Criticism: 
  The passage mentions that the physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  Therefore, it is possible that the physicists would have recognized the significance of the data earlier if they had been aware of these calculations.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture

  The Native American authors provide the content, while the non-Native American authors provide the translation, recording, and editing.
  The answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism: 
  The answer is close but not entirely accurate.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to written documents that are the result of collaboration between Native American and non-Native American authors.
  The Native American authors provide the content, while the non-Native American authors provide the solicitation, translation, recording, and editing.
  Therefore, the answer should be A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used in line 5.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a type of autobiography that is written by two people from different cultures who collaborate to produce the final product.
  The two people involved in the collaboration come from different cultures, but they contribute equally to the final product.
  The answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The answer is not entirely correct.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" does refer to a type of autobiography that involves collaboration between people from different cultures.
  However, the passage does not state that the two people involved in the collaboration contribute equally to the final product.
  The passage also does not state that the collaboration involves writing.
  Therefore, the answer cannot be B.
  The answer is most likely D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholars who have studied Native American autobiographies.
  The scholars have focused on written documents that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  The scholars have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the written documents that scholars have focused on.
  The phrase implies that the written documents are a collaboration between two cultures.
  The documents are written by a Native American and a non-Native American collaborator.
  The documents are a composite of the two cultures.
  Therefore, the answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The answer is not A because the documents are not based on artifacts and oral traditions of another culture.
  The answer is not C because the identities of the authors are known.
  The answer is not D because the documents were not originally written by a Native American.
  The answer is not E because the documents were not based solely on oral communication by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of studying Native American autobiographies that have been recorded and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the process by which these autobiographies were created.
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" suggests that the autobiographies were created by a collaboration between two cultures.
  The word "composite" implies that the finished product is a combination of different elements.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" means that the autobiographies were created through a collaboration between two cultures, with each contributing different elements to the finished product.
  Option B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product, seems to best capture this meaning.
Criticism:
  Option A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture, is not an accurate description of "bicultural composite authorship" because it does not involve collaboration between two cultures.
  Option C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined, is not an accurate description of "bicultural composite authorship" because it does not involve collaboration between two cultures and assumes that the identities of the writers cannot be determined.
  Option D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture, is not an accurate description of "bicultural composite authorship" because it implies that one culture had more control over the finished product than the other.
  Option E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture, is not an accurate description of "bicultural composite authorship" because it does not involve collaboration between two cultures and assumes that the finished product is written.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that the as-told-to life histories were created by non-Native American collaborators working with Native American individuals. The collaborators solicited, translated, recorded, and edited the life histories, resulting in a finished product that was a composite of the perspectives of both cultures. 
  A: This choice is incorrect because it refers to artifacts and oral traditions, which are not mentioned in the passage as part of the definition of "bicultural composite authorship."
  B: This choice is incorrect because it refers to two people contributing in the same way to the finished product, which is not necessarily the case in "bicultural composite authorship."
  C: This choice is incorrect because it refers to compiled writings of people from different cultures, which is not the same as "bicultural composite authorship."
  D: This choice is correct because it accurately describes the process of non-Native American collaborators editing and revising the work of Native American individuals, resulting in a finished product that is a composite of both cultures.
  E: This choice is incorrect because it refers to a member of one culture writing based on oral communication from a member of another culture, which is not the same as "bicultural composite authorship."

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon
  C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  D: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to introduce the main topic to be discussed
  E: to introduce the main topic to be discussed to present a view that will be argued against
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses research on the relationship between wealth and happiness, including the phenomena of habituation and rivalry, and how people compare their income to a norm.
  Passage B discusses different explanations for why earning more money makes people happier, including the idea that it is because relative prosperity makes people feel successful and that they have created value.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in both passages.
Thought:
  In Passage A, the Solnick and Hemenway study is used to support the idea that people care about their relative position compared to others and that their reference group is crucial for happiness.
  In Passage B, the Solnick and Hemenway study is used to argue against the idea that people are solely motivated by one-upmanship and to support the idea that people feel happier when they feel successful and have created value.
  Therefore, the authors mention the study for different reasons in each passage.
  The answer is C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon (Passage B) and to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided (Passage A).
Criticism:
  The answer is correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses research on the relationship between wealth and happiness, and how people compare their income with some norm that is rising along with actual income.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise
  C: concerned that research results supporting it may omit crucial anecdotal evidence indicating pitfalls in its use
  D: approving of its use on the grounds that its success is experimentally supported and can be psychologically explained
  E: skeptical of its suitability for use by lawyers without lengthy experience in courtroom strategies

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border
  B: a study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  However, what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. 
  The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement.
Thought:
  The author argues that the modular theory of mind may not be valid because mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  The author also argues that the subtractive method used in FMRI obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and creates an illusion of neat functional localization.
  Therefore, the author is unlikely to agree that the subtractive method strongly supports the modular theory of mind.
  The author is also unlikely to agree that the subtractive method is invalid for medical applications.
  The author does not discuss brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method.
  The author does not argue that the view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings

  However, the passage suggests that stealing thunder can be effective in creating an image of credibility, providing juries with an impetus for critical assessment, and framing evidence positively, and that jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing could be a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the strategy of "stealing thunder" in the courtroom.
  Stealing thunder involves a lawyer revealing negative information about their client before it is revealed by the opposing lawyer.
  The technique is believed to be effective by many lawyers and is supported by psychological research.
Thought:
  The question asks for a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
  The passage mentions several factors that may contribute to the success of stealing thunder, including:
    - Revealing damaging information early may create an image of credibility.
    - Stealing thunder may provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing testimony that the opposition plans to present.
    - Stealing thunder may make a piece of evidence brought by both sides seem less valuable.
    - The lawyer can frame the evidence in their own terms and downplay its significance.
    - Jurors are eager to solidify their position regarding the case and may use early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information.
  None of these factors exactly match any of the answer choices.
  However, choice D seems to come closest to the idea that jurors may be influenced by early information and may use it to guide their subsequent analysis.
Criticism:
  None.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.

  The main point of the passage is to inform the reader about the discovery of prions and their unique properties as a new class of infectious pathogens that lack nucleic acid and reproduce themselves through a process of protein malformation. The passage also discusses the link between prions and CJD, as well as the possibility that prions may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions. 
  Choice B accurately expresses this main point, while the other choices either focus on a specific detail (A, D, E) or make an unsupported claim (C).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions as a new type of protein pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  Prions lack nucleic acid and consist mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, but they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape.
  Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use
  D: detectable using brain scans enhanced by means of the subtractive method

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: According to the passage, which one of the following was true of the physics community during the 1930s?
Choices:
  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: It reevaluated caleulations indicating that atoms could be split
  C: It never identified the by-products ofneutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  D: It showed that uraniwn atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: It recogoized the daogers of working with radioactive substances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission in the 1930s.
  Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart before the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Between 1934 and 1939, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection for the discovery of nuclear fission.
Thought: 
  The passage describes how scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939.
  The passage also says that earlier, before the discovery of nuclear fission, theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the physics community did not neglect earlier theoretical developments.
  The passage also states that researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the physics community did not reevaluate calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
  The passage discusses how Meitner and other researchers discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, but these products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the physics community did not identify the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The passage does not provide evidence to suggest that uranium atoms were the easiest to split or that the physics community recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances.
  Therefore, options D and E can be eliminated.
  The best answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Criticism: 
  Upon further review, the passage does not provide evidence to suggest that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart before the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, option A is incorrect.
  The next best answer is B: It reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
  However, the passage does not provide evidence to suggest that the physics community reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split.

  Between 1934 and 1939, scientists were compiling evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  In 1938, Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden.
  Her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation.
  Late in that year, Hahn wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments.
  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Which one of the following is most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" (line 62)?
Choices:
  A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939
  B: the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938
  C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium
  D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus
  E: the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the evidence that led to its discovery.
  The evidence was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
Thought:
  The "relevant evidence" (line 62) is the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The author mentions that the evidence was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission was the identification of barium and technetium as products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Therefore, the answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission in the 1930s.
  The author notes that scientists had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that led to the recognition of nuclear fission.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "the relevant evidence" as something that had been present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The evidence must have been something that led to the recognition of nuclear fission.
  The evidence is not specifically identified in the passage, but it is likely that it refers to the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  These experiments produced radioactive products that went unidentified for some time.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that led to the recognition of nuclear fission.
  The evidence that led to the recognition of nuclear fission was likely the results of these experiments.
  Therefore, the most nearly equivalent statement to "the relevant evidence" is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, which was achieved through neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was a result of accumulating evidence over several years, but scientists did not recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
Thought: 
  The "relevant evidence" that the author refers to (line 62) is what allowed scientists to recognize that they had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  This evidence must be something that was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The evidence is not just the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium, which had been ongoing for several years, but something more specific.
  The evidence is not just the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, although this was a crucial piece of the puzzle.
  The evidence is not just the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus, although this was also a crucial piece of the puzzle.
  The evidence is not the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long, although this may have contributed to the delay in recognizing the significance of the results.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which provided the accumulating evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission but lacked the right conceptual link until Meitner provided it in 1939.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, which was achieved through experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The discovery was made between 1934 and 1939, but the significance of the evidence was not recognized until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
Thought:
  The "relevant evidence" referred to in line 62 is the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The discovery was made through experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium, which were conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" is most nearly equivalent to the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  The answer is A.
Criticism:
  You are correct that the discovery of nuclear fission was made through experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  However, the passage specifically mentions that the evidence was compiled by scientists between 1934 and 1939, and that Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" could also be interpreted as the evidence that was compiled during this time period, rather than all experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Both A and B could be considered correct answers, but A is more inclusive and therefore a better answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The researchers had been compiling evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but they did not recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "the relevant evidence" as something that was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The author also mentions that the researchers had been compiling evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Therefore, "the relevant evidence" is likely the evidence that the researchers had been compiling but did not recognize as nuclear fission until Meitner provided the theoretical connection.
  The evidence that the researchers had been compiling is described as "products" resulting from neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The evidence that Hahn found, which Meitner recognized as nuclear fission, was that barium had been produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Therefore, the most nearly equivalent choice to "the relevant evidence" is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the evidence that led to its recognition.
  The author uses the phrase "the relevant evidence" to refer to evidence that was present but not recognized as indicating nuclear fission.
Thought: 
  The passage explains that scientists had been bombarding uranium with neutrons and producing radioactive substances, but they did not recognize that they were splitting uranium atoms until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  The author uses the phrase "the relevant evidence" to refer to evidence that was present but not recognized as indicating nuclear fission.
  The evidence that led to the recognition of nuclear fission was the identification of barium as a product of neutron bombardment of uranium, which was surprising because it was not a close element to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Therefore, the answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the evidence that led up to it.
  The author refers to "the relevant evidence" in line 62.
Thought: 
  The relevant evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission was the evidence that scientists had been splitting uranium atoms.
  This evidence was present in the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted between 1934 and 1939.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection between the evidence and the underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, the answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct. 
  The other choices are either too specific (B, C, D) or too general (E) to be considered "the relevant evidence" that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and how it took some time for scientists to recognize the significance of the evidence they had gathered.
  The evidence was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
Thought: 
  The "relevant evidence" is what the scientists had been witnessing but had not recognized as nuclear fission.
  The passage describes how the scientists had been conducting experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium and had been producing radioactive substances.
  They had identified barium as one of the substances produced, which had been surprising because it was impossible to produce through any mechanism they had envisaged.
  It was Lise Meitner who recognized the significance of the data and concluded that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" is the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which included the identification of barium as one of the substances produced.
  The evidence was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  Choice A is the most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence."
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, which was achieved through neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The physicists involved in the discovery compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but did not recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "the relevant evidence" in line 62.
  The evidence must have been present for some time, but lacked the right conceptual link.
  Based on the context, the evidence is likely related to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The evidence is not limited to a specific experiment or result, but rather a broader set of data that was available but not fully understood.
  Therefore, the most nearly equivalent option is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism: 
  Option A is too specific, as it refers to a particular set of experiments.
  The evidence referred to by the author is broader than that, encompassing all of the data that had been compiled but not fully understood.
  Option C is also a strong contender, as it refers to the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  However, this evidence alone was not enough to fully understand what was happening, as it went against previous experiences of nuclear physics.
  Option D is also a strong contender, as it refers to the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus.
  However, this fact alone was not enough to fully understand what was happening, as it required the right conceptual link to be made.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, which was achieved through neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The discovery was made between 1934 and 1939 by a group of Italian physicists and others.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "the relevant evidence" in line 62.
  The evidence must have been present before Meitner's theoretical connection in 1939.
  The evidence must have been related to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The evidence must have been overlooked or misunderstood by scientists.
  The evidence must have been crucial to recognizing the significance of the discovery.
  The only option that fits all of these criteria is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Roy Lichtenstein and his role in defining pop art.
  Lichtenstein's work merged popular genres with fine art, and conveyed a seriousness of theme that went beyond parody.
  Pop art emerged as an alternative to abstract expressionism, which had lost much of its force by the early 1960s.
  Lichtenstein's work rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, and displayed an impulse toward realism and a depiction of contemporary life.
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, and as displaying an impulse toward realism and a depiction of contemporary life.
  If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, it would suggest that he was more engaged with abstract expressionism than the author implies.
  If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an emotional painting, it would suggest that he valued emotional expression in painting more than the author implies.
  If Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, it would suggest that he valued emotional restraint in pop art more than the author implies.
  If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Therefore, choice A or B would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Criticism: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, and as displaying an impulse toward realism and a depiction of contemporary life.
  However, attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters or praising an abstract expressionist for producing an emotional painting would not necessarily contradict these characterizations.
  The author does not suggest that Lichtenstein completely rejected abstract expressionism or emotional expression in painting, but rather that he rebelled against the excess of sophistication and histrionics that he observed in some abstract expressionists and pop artists.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Roy Lichtenstein's contribution to pop art.
  Lichtenstein's work incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings.
  His work conveyed a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody.
  Pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism.
  Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
  Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete.
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists.
  The author also characterizes Lichtenstein's work as displaying an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
  If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, it would suggest that he was not rebelling against abstract expressionism and his work was not a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in the movement.
  If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting, it would suggest that he did not view abstract expressionism as lacking in emotional power.
  If Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein since it is not clear whether he viewed early abstract expressionism as lacking in emotional power.
  If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein since it is not clear whether he viewed pop art as lacking in emotional power.
  If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein since it is not clear whether he believed that pop art should have emotional power.
Conclusion: 
  The answer is A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  This would suggest that Lichtenstein was not rebelling against abstract expressionism and his work was not a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in the movement, which challenges the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation

  The last paragraph of the passage describes how wampum belts were used to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution.
  These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols.
  The belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business.
  The wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, but it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
  Therefore, the last paragraph of the passage primarily serves to illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation.
  The answer is C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage that the last paragraph serves to detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum (A).
  There is no evidence in the passage that the last paragraph serves to distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum (B).
  There is no evidence in the passage that the last paragraph serves to outline the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution as it was encoded using wampum (D).
  While the last paragraph does give evidence of wampum's effectiveness as a means of ensuring compliance with the law of the Haudenosaune Confederacy, this is not its primary purpose (E).

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means

  Passage B argues that transparency is a basic principle of the stock market and that insider trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have, but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This means that the law should allow people to use their own analysis to make informed trade decisions but not allow people to use information that is not shared by everyone. 
  None of the choices exactly matches this position, but choice B comes closest. It permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
  Choice A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which is broader than what passage A argues for. 
  Choice C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is similar to what passage B argues for. 
  Choice D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not what passage A argues for. 
  Choice E legalizes trading based on inside information, which is not what passage A argues for.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.

  The passage discusses the chemical theory of how communication between neurons occurs and the role of receptors in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  It also explains how differences among receptors may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two theories of how communication between neurons occurs: electrical and chemical.
  The theory of chemical communication involves the secretion of a neurotransmitter by an excited neuron that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron, rendering the neuron permeable to ions and generating an electrical impulse that runs through the cell.
  The structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  Receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  Each receptor in the neurotransmitter-gated ion channel family comes in several varieties, allowing for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses a contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory represents the idea of increasing returns to scale, which can lead to monopolies.
  The Invisible Hand represents the idea that self-interest can lead to the common good in a competitive market.
  Diminishing returns lend themselves more easily to mathematical representation than increasing returns.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is to explain the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory and how this contradiction has been resolved over time. 
  The Pin Factory represents the idea of increasing returns to scale, which can lead to monopolies, while the Invisible Hand represents the idea that self-interest can lead to the common good in a competitive market. 
  Diminishing returns lend themselves more easily to mathematical representation than increasing returns, which is why the Pin Factory was not initially accepted by mainstream economists. 
  However, recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously, leading to its acceptance in economic thought.
  Therefore, the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 
Criticism: 
  While the passage does discuss recent developments in mathematics that have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously, the main point is not that the Pin Factory can now be modeled more rigorously than the Invisible Hand. 
  Rather, the main point is that the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand has been resolved over time, with increasing returns now being accepted in economic thought. 
  Therefore, a better answer might be: Economists have resolved the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, with increasing returns now being accepted in economic thought.

Therefore, the best answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Criticism:
  The passage does not suggest that economists have "failed" to account for increasing returns to scale, but rather that it has been difficult to incorporate the Pin Factory into economic theory due to its difficulty to represent mathematically. Additionally, the passage does not suggest that this has only been a recent development, but rather that it has been an ongoing challenge for economists for almost two centuries. Therefore, the wording of answer E could be improved to more accurately reflect the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
- The Pin Factory represents the idea of increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand represents the idea of harnessing self-interest to the common good in a competitive marketplace.
- The assumption of diminishing returns has dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, but the idea of increasing returns has recently surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought.
Thought:
- The main point of the passage is to explain the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory and how recent developments have allowed the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously.
- The passage discusses the assumptions of diminishing returns and increasing returns, but it does not say that mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing, so A is incorrect.
- The passage does say that economists have always sought rigor and clarity in their ideas and that the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. This supports the idea that the functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor, so B is a possible answer.
- The passage does not say that recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand, so C is incorrect.
- The passage does mention Adam Smith and his ideas about the Invisible Hand, but this is not the main point of the passage, so D is incorrect.
- The passage does discuss how economists have failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries until somewhat recently, and how recent developments have allowed the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously, so E is a possible answer.
Criticism:
- While the passage does mention that the functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor, it also discusses other factors that have contributed to the dominance of the assumption of diminishing returns in economic theory, such as the desire for elegance and formalism. Therefore, B is not a complete and accurate representation of the main point of the passage.
- While the passage does discuss recent developments in economic thought that have allowed the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously, this is not the main point of the passage. The main point is to explain the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand and how recent developments have affected economic thought. Therefore, E is not a complete and accurate representation of the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the above")

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915
  D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain
  E: suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately characterizes the relationship between the two passages?
Choices:
  A: Passage A offers a critique of a power possessed by juries, while passage B argues in support of that power.
  B: Passage A denounces a judicial custom,while passage B proposes improvements to that custom.
  C: Passage A surveys a range of evidence about jury behavior, while passage B suggests a hypothesis to explain that behavior.
  D: Passage A argues that a problem facting legal systems is intractable, while passage B presents a solution to that problem.
  E: Passage A raises a question concerning a legal procedure, while passage B attempts to answer that question.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the concept of jury nullification, where a jury acquits a defendant in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. It argues that the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great.
  Passage B argues that the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. It suggests that when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature.
Thought:
  Passage A critiques the power of jury nullification, while Passage B argues in support of that power. 
  Therefore, the relationship between the two passages is that they present opposing views on the concept of jury nullification.
  The answer is A: Passage A offers a critique of a power possessed by juries, while passage B argues in support of that power.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in Passage B that it argues in support of the power of jury nullification.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

  The answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between plants and their primary and secondary substances and automobiles and their mechanical components and features is not entirely accurate.
  While it is true that primary substances are required for plants to grow and function, secondary substances are not just for taste and smell; they also serve as biochemical defenses against plant enemies.
  In contrast, features such as paint and taillights on automobiles do not serve a defensive purpose.
  Therefore, the analogy is flawed.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the ways in which art historically was produced by and for political and social elites.
  The passage notes that there are two different ways that art was produced for elites.
  The passage suggests that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way.
  The passage notes that the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  This is because Taruskin and others prefer to deal with art produced by elites that expressed and mirrored their ideals and way of life.
  For this kind of analysis to work, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  Therefore, if high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite endures, it must be because it actually supports that ideology in some way.
  The passage does not suggest that Taruskin believes that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite.
  The passage also does not suggest that Taruskin believes that the most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  The passage notes that the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures, so it is unlikely that Taruskin believes that typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the ways in which art was historically produced for and by political and social elites.
  Taruskin is a sociohistorical critic of music.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way. This is because Taruskin prefers to deal with art produced by elites that expresses and mirrors their ideals and way of life. For this kind of analysis to work, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived. Therefore, Taruskin must claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the ways in which art has been produced by and for political and social elites throughout history.
  The passage suggests that there are two different ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
  The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  The passage suggests that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Taruskin and others prefer to deal with art produced by and for political and social elites that expresses and mirrors their ideals and way of life.
  The passage suggests that for this kind of analysis to work, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  The passage suggests that the sociohistorical critic must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
  However, the passage does not suggest that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite in hidden or subtle ways.
  The passage also does not suggest that the most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  The passage does suggest that art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way, but it does not suggest that this is Taruskin's position.
  The passage does not suggest that typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  Therefore, none of the choices accurately reflects Taruskin's position.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how art historically was produced by and for political and social elites in two different ways.
  The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
  The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  The sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art is produced by and for political and social elites in a way that embodies the ideology of the elite, even if the identity of the artist is not the same as the elite.
  The passage does not suggest that Taruskin believes that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  The passage does not suggest that Taruskin believes that the most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  The passage suggests that if high art endures and appears to undermine the ideology of the elite, it actually supports that ideology in some way, but it does not suggest that Taruskin commits to this view.
  The passage does not suggest that typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Criticism: 
  There is no direct statement in the passage that Taruskin believes that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
  However, the passage does suggest that Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced in a way that enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
  The passage also suggests that a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings, and that some of this art endured.
  Therefore, while the answer may not be directly supported by the passage, it is a reasonable inference based on the information provided.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the ways in which art historically was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The passage suggests that there are two different ways that art was produced for elites: (1) by engaging a well-known artist to produce something for display, and (2) by creating a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  The passage notes that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  This is because Taruskin and others prefer to deal with art produced by elites that expresses and mirrors their ideals and way of life, and they construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodies the ideology of the elite.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position commits him to the view that if high art endures, it must have supported the ideology of the elite in some way, even if it appears to undermine it.
  The answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Criticism:
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  However, the passage also notes that the sociohistorical critic must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis to claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  D: Most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: Dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of dance-isolation technique into North American and European choreography.
  Dunham was a pioneer in the field of dance ethnology as an anthropologist in the 1930s.
  Dance had been neglected as an area of social research before Dunham's work.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  The passage also suggests that Dunham generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself.
  Therefore, Dunham's colleagues in anthropology would have been most likely to agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  The answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that Dunham's colleagues in anthropology would have agreed with the statement in choice B.
  The passage does not provide enough information to eliminate any of the other choices.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:

  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of the dance-isolation technique and her success in bringing traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into modern North American dance.
  Dunham was a pioneer in the field of dance ethnology, conducting research into traditional Caribbean dance forms with a special interest in their origins in African culture.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from the prevailing methodology at the time, as she participated in the dances she was observing rather than remaining detached.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Dunham's success in bringing traditional dance techniques into modern North American dance was due in part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  The passage also suggests that dance had been neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists were not trained in dance and because experts in dance were not trained in social research methods.
  The passage implies that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have subscribed to the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Therefore, the statement that the "peers" would have been most likely to agree with is that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  The answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.

  The passage does not explicitly state that the "peers" would have agreed with this statement, but it is the most likely interpretation based on the information provided.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of dance-isolation and her success in bringing traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into modern North American dance.
  Dunham was an anthropologist who conducted research into traditional Caribbean dance forms and their origins in African culture.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from the prevailing methodology at the time, as she participated in the dances herself to better understand them.
Thought: 
  The "peers" mentioned in line 22 are likely to be social scientists who did not consider dance as an area of social research.
  The passage suggests that these peers subscribed to the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Therefore, they would most likely agree with statement B: social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: 
  While the passage suggests that social scientists neglected dance as an area of social research, it does not explicitly state that they believed they could obtain reliable data about dance without being well versed in dance traditions.
  In fact, the passage suggests the opposite, as Dunham's success in bringing traditional dance techniques into modern North American dance was due in part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  Therefore, it is possible that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would not agree with statement B.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of a dance technique called dance-isolation, and her success in bringing traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance. 
  Dunham was an anthropologist in the 1930s and conducted research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. 
  Her approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time, as she participated in the dances herself to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.

  The passage suggests that Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances and because they subscribed to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  The "peers" mentioned in line 22 are likely to share this view and believe that social scientists need to be detached from the cultural practices they are studying in order to obtain reliable data.
  Therefore, the statement that the "peers" would have been most likely to agree with is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the "peers" would have agreed with statement B.
  The passage suggests that Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, but it does not indicate whether they believed that social scientists need to be detached from the cultural practices they are studying in order to obtain reliable data.
  Therefore, another statement may be more accurate.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of dance-isolation technique and her success in bringing traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance.

  Therefore, it can be inferred that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  This is supported by the fact that colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing and to conduct data gathering from a position of complete detachment.
  However, Dunham's success in bringing traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance suggests that her approach to research was effective.
  Therefore, the statement that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision (choice C) is not supported by the passage.

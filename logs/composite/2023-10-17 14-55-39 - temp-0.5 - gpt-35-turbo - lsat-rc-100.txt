Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the phenomenon of habituation and rivalry and how they affect people's perception of income and happiness.
  Passage B argues that the desire to earn more money than one's neighbors is not driven by a need for one-upmanship but rather by a desire to create value.
Thought: 
  Neither passage A nor passage B would likely use the term "egocentric" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors because passage B argues that the desire to earn more money is not driven by a need for one-upmanship.
  Passage A might use the term "misguided" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors because it suggests that such a desire is not conducive to happiness.
  Passage B might use the term "admirable" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors because it suggests that such a desire is driven by a desire to create value.
  Neither passage A nor passage B would likely use the terms "insular," "cosmopolitan," "happy," "miserable," "lucky," or "primitive" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Criticism: 
  The term "misguided" may be too strong of a word to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors. It suggests that such a desire is inherently wrong or misguided, which is not necessarily the case.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  Passage A mentions the phenomena of habituation and rivalry, which push up the norm for income and cause people to compare themselves to others.
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because it makes them feel successful and that the desire to create value benefits society.
Thought:
  The question asks us to identify the terms that the authors of Passage A and Passage B would use to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  Passage A discusses the idea of rivalry and how people compare themselves to others in terms of income.
  Passage B argues that people want to create value and that earning more money makes people feel successful.
  Neither passage provides clear indications of the terms that the authors would use to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  However, based on the information provided, the authors of Passage A might describe such a person as egocentric or misguided, while the authors of Passage B might describe them as driven or ambitious.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Criticism:
  It is difficult to determine the exact terms that the authors of each passage would use to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  The answer is based on an interpretation of the passages and may not be the only possible answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses how people compare their income with some norm and that norm must be rising along with actual income. 
  Passage A also discusses the phenomenon of rivalry and how people compare themselves to their "reference group" for happiness.
  Passage B discusses how earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful and have created value.
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B view the desire to make more money than one's neighbors in a positive light, as a way to create value and feel successful. 
  Therefore, the authors would most likely not use terms such as "misguided" or "primitive" to describe such a person.
  The authors would also not use terms such as "cosmopolitan" or "altruistic" because those terms do not relate directly to the desire to make more money than one's neighbors.
  The authors might use the term "egocentric" to describe such a person, but it has negative connotations and does not accurately reflect their overall positive view of the desire to create value and feel successful.
  Therefore, the most likely pair of terms that the authors would use to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is "admirable" and "happy."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A and Passage B discuss research on the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  Passage A discusses the phenomena of habituation and rivalry, which push up the norm of what we consider a sufficient income.
  Passage A also describes how people compare their income to a norm and that people's level of happiness depends on their relative position to others.
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful and that people use material wealth to show that they create value.
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B do not use the terms "insular," "cosmopolitan," "altruistic," "egocentric," "happy," "miserable," "misguided," "admirable," "lucky," or "primitive" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  However, based on the content of the passages, the authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely have different opinions on whether a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is admirable or misguided.
  Passage A suggests that people compare their income to a norm and that people's level of happiness depends on their relative position to others. The authors of Passage A might argue that a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is misguided because this person is focused on relative income rather than on absolute income or other aspects of life that contribute to happiness.
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful and that people use material wealth to show that they create value. The authors of Passage B might argue that a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is admirable because this person is motivated to create value and to feel successful.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely use the terms "misguided" and "admirable," respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  Passage A argues that people compare their income to a norm that rises as their income rises, and that people are happy when their relative income improves.
  Passage B argues that people are happy when they feel successful and have created value, and that the desire to create value benefits society.
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as someone who is egocentric, because both passages suggest that people are happy when they feel successful and have created value, and that the desire to create value benefits society. Wanting to make more money than one's neighbors could be seen as a manifestation of this desire to create value, but it could also be seen as egocentric because it is focused on improving one's own relative position rather than benefiting society as a whole.
  Therefore, the answer is B: altruistic, egocentric.
Criticism: 
  The answer is not A, C, D, or E because none of these pairs of terms accurately reflect the authors' views on the relationship between wealth and happiness or the motivations behind wanting to make more money than one's neighbors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passages discuss research on happiness and wealth, and how people's happiness is affected by their income relative to others. 
  Passage A discusses two phenomena, habituation and rivalry, that push up the norm for income and make people want to earn more. 
  Passage B argues that people want to earn more because they want to feel successful and create value, not just to have more than others.
Thought: 
  The question asks about the terms that the authors would use to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors. 
  Passage A discusses the phenomenon of rivalry and how people compare themselves to their reference group. 
  Passage B argues that people want to create value and feel successful. 
  Neither passage uses the terms "altruistic" or "egocentric," which suggest a moral judgment. 
  Neither passage uses the terms "insular" or "cosmopolitan," which are not directly related to the topic. 
  Passage A might use the term "misguided" to describe a person who overinvests in material possessions at the expense of leisure, but this is not the same as wanting to make more money than one's neighbors. 
  Passage B might use the term "admirable" to describe a person who wants to create value, but this is not the same as wanting to make more money than one's neighbors. 
  Neither passage uses the term "primitive" or "lucky." 
  Therefore, none of the choices is a good match for the passages.
Criticism: 
  The answer choices do not seem to be related to the passages. 
  The question asks about the terms that the authors would use, but the passages do not provide any clear indication of what those terms might be. 
  The question seems to be asking about a moral judgment, but the passages do not take a clear position on whether it is good or bad to want to make more money than one's neighbors.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the phenomenon of people comparing their income with some norm and how it affects their happiness.
  Passage B argues that people want to create value and that earning more money makes them feel successful and, therefore, happier. 
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B both discuss the concept of people wanting to make more money than their neighbors.
  However, they have different views on the motivation behind this desire.
  Passage A suggests that people compare their income with some norm and that they are happy as long as their relative position improves.
  Passage B argues that people want to create value and that earning more money makes them feel successful, which in turn, makes them happier.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely use different terms to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Answer: A: insular, cosmopolitan, B: altruistic, egocentric, C: happy, miserable, D: misguided, admirable, E: lucky, primitive.
Criticism: 
  The question does not provide any specific information to suggest which terms the authors of Passage A and Passage B would use to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.

Thought:
  Passage A describes the phenomenon of rivalry, where people want to make more money than their neighbors.
  Passage B argues that wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness.
  The authors in Passage A and Passage B would likely have different views on a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely use different pairs of terms to describe this person.
  The answer is not A, C, E because these pairs of terms are not relevant to the discussion.
  The answer is not D because the authors in Passage A and Passage B would likely have different opinions on this person.
  The authors in Passage A and Passage B would most likely use the pair of terms egocentric and admirable, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.

  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which means that as a business or factory grows larger, it becomes more efficient and can produce more output per worker or unit of input.
  A: The example of a publishing house relaxing standards to employ fewer editors does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  B: The example of a bee colony using some bees solely to guard nectar sources does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  C: The example of a school district switching to year-round operation to increase the number of students accommodated in a single building does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  D: The example of the lobster industry using technology to make catching lobsters easier, and thus increasing output per trap, illustrates increasing returns to scale.
  E: The example of a large ant colony dividing and producing more colonies that together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that as a business or factory grows larger, it becomes more efficient and can produce more output per worker or unit of input.
  The example of the lobster industry using technology to catch more lobsters per trap illustrates increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the answer is D.
Criticism: 
  The example of the lobster industry could be criticized because it does not explicitly mention the size of the industry or the number of traps used, which are important factors in the concept of increasing returns to scale. However, it is still the best answer choice because it describes a situation where technology enables the industry to catch more lobsters per trap, leading to increased output per unit of input.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale means that as the scale of production increases, the output per unit of input increases.
  A: The passage does not mention a publishing house or editors.
  B: The passage does not mention bees or bee colonies.
  C: The passage does not mention a school district or year-round operation.
  D: The passage mentions the lobster industry and advances in technology that make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through, but it does not describe how this leads to increasing returns to scale.
  E: The passage does not mention ant colonies.
Thought: 
  The passage describes how the pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently.
  This is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  As the scale of production increases, the output per unit of input increases.
  Therefore, the best answer is one that describes an industry where the output per unit of input increases as the scale of production increases.
  The lobster industry is mentioned, but the passage does not describe how advances in technology lead to increasing returns to scale.
  The best answer is E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Criticism: 
  The answer is correct.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which means that as production increases, the cost per unit of production decreases.
  A: The example given involves relaxing standards for editors, which does not relate to increasing returns to scale.
  B: The example given involves a large bee colony and how it is able to collect more nectar, which relates to economies of scale, not increasing returns to scale.
  C: The example given involves a school district increasing the number of students in a single building by switching to year-round operation, which relates to economies of scale, not increasing returns to scale.
  D: The example given involves the lobster industry being able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps due to advances in technology, which is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  E: The example given involves a large ant colony dividing and producing two competing colonies, which does not relate to increasing returns to scale.
Thought: 
  The key concept of increasing returns to scale is that as production increases, the cost per unit of production decreases.
  The lobster industry example given in option D describes how advances in technology allow the industry to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps, which means that the cost per lobster caught decreases as the number of lobsters caught increases.
  Therefore, option D best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale refers to the idea that as the size of a business grows, the productivity of its workers increases and it can produce more output per worker.
  A: The productivity of editors in a publishing house is not related to the size of the business, so this example does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  B: The example of a bee colony does not relate to a business or industry, so it is not an example of increasing returns to scale in the context of the passage.
  C: The example of a school district does not relate to a business or industry, so it is not an example of increasing returns to scale in the context of the passage.
  D: The lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps because of advances in technology, which is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  E: The example of an ant colony does not relate to a business or industry, so it is not an example of increasing returns to scale in the context of the passage.
Thought: 
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale as the concept that as the size of a business grows, the productivity of its workers increases and it can produce more output per worker.
  The example of the lobster industry being able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps because of advances in technology illustrates this concept.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant flaw in the logic or reasoning that leads to the selection of choice D as the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale as the process by which larger firms achieve lower costs than smaller firms, and therefore tend to drive smaller firms out of business. 
  The passage also notes that the Pin Factory is an example of increasing returns to scale, in which the more specialized workers can be, the more productive the factory is per worker.
Thought: 
  A: This answer choice describes a decrease in productivity, not an increase, so it cannot be the correct answer.
  B: This answer choice describes an increase in productivity due to specialization, which is similar to the Pin Factory example. However, it is not related to firms achieving lower costs through increased size, so it may not be the best answer.
  C: This answer choice describes an increase in the number of students that can be accommodated in a single building through scheduling changes, but it does not describe a decrease in costs or an increase in productivity through larger scale. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
  D: This answer choice describes an increase in the productivity of lobster catching due to technological advances, which is similar to the Pin Factory example. It also describes a decrease in costs through increased productivity. Therefore, it is a strong contender for the correct answer.
  E: This answer choice describes an increase in the total number of ants due to division and specialization, which is similar to the Pin Factory example. However, it does not describe a decrease in costs or an increase in productivity through larger scale. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  Answer choice B is a bit of a stretch, as it describes a bee colony rather than a firm, and it is not directly related to achieving lower costs through increased size. However, it is still a plausible answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which means that as a business or factory grows in size, its productivity per worker increases.
  A: The passage does not mention a publishing house or editors, and there is no indication that relaxing standards would increase productivity.
  B: The passage does not mention a bee colony, and there is no indication that having guard bees would increase productivity.
  C: The passage does not mention a school district, and there is no indication that a different schedule would increase productivity.
  D: The passage describes how the lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters per day with the same number of traps because of advances in technology, which is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  E: The passage does not mention an ant colony, and there is no indication that dividing into more colonies would increase productivity.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an example of increasing returns to scale, which means that as a business or factory grows in size, its productivity per worker increases.
  The passage provides an example of the lobster industry catching more lobsters per day with the same number of traps because of advances in technology.

Criticism: 
  The answer is correct. The passage provides a clear example of increasing returns to scale, and the lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters per day with the same number of traps because of advances in technology.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale as the concept that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more it can produce per worker. 
  A: The example describes a decrease in the number of editors, which does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: The example describes a bee colony that uses some bees for guarding nectar sources, which does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  C: The example describes a school district that increases the total number of students in a single building by switching to year-round operation, which does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  D: The example describes the lobster industry being able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps because of advances in technology, which does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  E: The example describes a large ant colony dividing into two colonies that eventually grow large enough to divide into more colonies, which illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Thought: 
  The concept of increasing returns to scale is that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more it can produce per worker.
  The example of a large ant colony dividing into more colonies illustrates increasing returns to scale because the more colonies there are, the more ants there are overall, which is similar to the idea that the bigger the factory, the more it can produce per worker.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the concept of increasing returns to scale is that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more it can produce per worker.
  However, the example in the passage describes the idea that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. 
  The example of a large ant colony dividing into more colonies is not directly related to the idea of firms driving each other out of business, but it does illustrate the idea of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the answer is still E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony. 
Action: Answer("E")

  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. This does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony. This illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that as a company grows larger, its production increases at a greater rate than its inputs.
  The example of the ant colony dividing and producing more colonies that together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic or reasoning.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:

  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to
Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work
  B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work
  C: acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works
  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works
  E: explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Dostoyevsky's position on literature was that reality was the crucial source of literature, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics. There was no distinction between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky opposed the radical critics' view that art must have a political purpose. He believed that art must be judged on its "artistic merit," which is the ability to write well. Therefore, if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view would be most softened.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position in the literary criticism of his time.
  He believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  For Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society; literature should be useful.
  He believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  He also believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view that art should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.
  D: The innovative research methods of Katherine Dunham made possible her discovery that the dance traditions of the Caribbean were derived from earlier African dance traditions.
  E: Katherine Dunham's anthropological and choreographic expertise enabled her to make contributions that altered the landscape of modern dance in North America.

Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how it is structured like a jazz composition, with individual characters' voices and the narrator's voice weaving together.
  A: This choice is partially true, as the passage does argue that Morrison has simulated the style of a genius of music in her novel.
  B: This choice is not mentioned in the passage and is not relevant to the author's assertion.
  C: This choice is too broad and makes a sweeping generalization about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists.
  D: This choice is too vague and does not address the author's assertion about Jazz specifically.
  E: This choice is not relevant to the author's assertion and is not discussed in the passage.
Thought:
  The author's assertion is about how Morrison has structured Jazz like a jazz composition, with individual voices and a collective narration.
  None of the answer choices directly address this assertion.
  Choice A comes closest, as it acknowledges that Morrison has intentionally simulated the style of jazz performance in the narration.
  However, the choice does not fully capture the complexity of Morrison's structure and the relationship between individual voices and the collective narration.
Criticism:
  While Choice A is partially true, it does not fully capture the author's assertion about Morrison's structure in Jazz.
  The other answer choices are either irrelevant or too broad to address the author's assertion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and the way in which the story is told, which is similar to the structure of jazz music.

Thought: 
  The author asserts that Toni Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, similar to the structure of a jazz ensemble.
  The author compares Morrison's technique to that of Duke Ellington, who constructed his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind.
  Therefore, if it were true that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, it would support the author's assertion that Morrison's use of jazz structure in Jazz is significant and innovative.
  The answer is B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
Criticism: 
  The author only discusses African American writers drawing upon music as theme and metaphor in their writing, not specifically using the structure of music in their work.

Thought: 
  Lines 11-16 discuss the way in which the story is told in Jazz, using a structure that is analogous to the playing of a jazz hand.
  The author suggests that no other writer has attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel before Toni Morrison did so in Jazz.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if there were evidence that other writers had used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel before Toni Morrison did so in Jazz.
  Choice B discusses the use of the typical structure of blues music, which is not the same as the use of a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  Choice E compares African American and non-African American writers, which is not relevant to the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
  Choices A, C, and D are too broad or not supported by the passage.
  Therefore, none of the other choices would call the author's assertion into question.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music.
  The narration in Jazz has similarities to the structure of a jazz composition.
Thought:
  The author claims that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  This is similar to the way a jazz composition allows individual musicians to improvise while still adhering to the overall structure of the piece.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if it were not true that Morrison's novel Jazz has similarities to the structure of a jazz composition.
  The only choice that contradicts this is B, which claims that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  However, this does not address the specific assertion about Jazz and its connection to jazz music.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.

Thought: 
  Passage B describes how scientists hypothesized the existence of a planet, which was later confirmed to be Neptune, to explain the failure of predictions made using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the solar system.
  The discovery of Neptune was based on the failure of predictions made using existing theories and auxiliary assumptions, and the hypothesized existence of another planet to explain the discrepancies.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the one where scientists hypothesized the existence of another entity to explain discrepancies in predictions made using existing theories and auxiliary assumptions.

  Later, they discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to produce the observed orbit.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of the planet Uranus and the subsequent search for another planet to explain its orbit.
  The answer is not A, B, C, D, or E.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Criticism: 
  The answer cannot be "None of the Above" because the question asks for the most analogous scientific episode, not an exact analogy.
  While none of the answer choices are a perfect match, some are more analogous than others.
  Answer choice C, Walter Alvarez's postulation about the extinction of the dinosaurs, is the least analogous because it does not involve the discovery of a new scientific phenomenon.
  Answer choice B, Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda, is also not very analogous because it does not involve the discovery of a new planet or celestial body.
  Answer choice A, Galileo's theory of tides, and answer choice D, Bernard Brunhes's discovery about Earth's magnetic field, are somewhat analogous because they involve incorrect predictions that led to the discovery of new phenomena.
  However, answer choice E, Wolfgang Pauli's postulation about the neutron decay, is the most analogous because it involves the postulation of a new particle to explain an observed phenomenon, which is similar to the postulation of a new planet to explain the orbit of Uranus.

  They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune.
  Later, scientists discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of planet Vulcan, which was hypothesized to exist based on deviations in the orbit of Mercury.
  Scientists hypothesized the existence of Vulcan, but it was never found.
  This is similar to the hypothesis of the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Uranus, which was later discovered and named Neptune.
  The answer is D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between the discovery of Neptune and the hypothesis of Vulcan is not perfect.
  While both hypotheses were based on deviations in the orbit of a planet, the discovery of Neptune was based on a more accurate prediction of the orbit of Uranus, while the hypothesis of Vulcan was based on deviations in the orbit of Mercury that were later explained by Einstein's theory of relativity.
  Therefore, another scientific episode may be more analogous to the discovery of Neptune.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk.
  The author argues that judgments about voluntariness are often based on confusion and selective attention.

Thought: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not a useful guide for regulatory policy.
  The author suggests that policy decisions should be based on a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  The answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
Criticism: 
  The author does not agree with the statement that people should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose (A).
  The author does not discuss the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury for plane crashes (C).

  The author suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
Thought:
  The author argues against the use of the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks in guiding regulatory policy.
  The author suggests that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  The author does not express support or opposition to people being protected against the risks incurred through dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose.
  The author suggests that policy experts would focus on aggregate lives at stake, rather than whether the risk is voluntarily incurred.
  The author does not provide information to support the claim that plane crashes are more likely to occur or result in death or injury than any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks, and how it is often used to justify different policy decisions.
  A: The passage does not explicitly state whether people should or should not be protected against risks incurred through dangerous activities.
  B: The passage suggests that policy experts may focus more on aggregate lives at stake than on whether a risk is voluntary or involuntary, but does not make a definitive statement about the relevance of victims' choices.
  C: The passage does not provide any comparative statistics about the probability of different kinds of risks.
  D: The passage argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is often unclear and can be influenced by factors other than the individual's choice.
  E: The passage briefly mentions unforeseeable collisions with asteroids as an example of involuntarily incurred risk, but does not make a definitive statement about the main category of involuntarily incurred risk.
Thought:
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is often unclear and can be influenced by factors other than the individual's choice. Therefore, policy decisions should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, rather than relying on the voluntariness of a particular risk as a proxy for its importance. 
  None of the answer choices directly reflects this argument, but answer choice D comes closest by stating that a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
Criticism:
  Answer choice D is a partial restatement of the author's argument, but it is not a complete or entirely accurate representation. The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is often unclear and can be influenced by factors other than the individual's choice. The author also argues that policy decisions should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, rather than relying on the voluntariness of a particular risk as a proxy for its importance. Answer choice D only addresses the first part of the argument, and does not mention the importance of understanding the underlying factors.

  B: The passage suggests that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, but it does not make a clear statement about whether the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly is irrelevant or not.
  C: The passage does not provide any information about the probability of occurrence or resulting death or injury for plane crashes or any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: The passage suggests that determining whether a risk is voluntary or involuntary is not always straightforward and that it is not a useful distinction for guiding policy decisions.
  E: The passage briefly mentions that an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid would be an example of an involuntarily incurred risk, but it does not make a clear statement about natural disasters.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not a useful one for guiding policy decisions, and that policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. The author also suggests that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  None of the choices directly address the author's main argument or position.
Criticism: 
  None.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?
Choices:
  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  Ozone is a toxic form of oxygen that screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere.
  Stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium.
  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  CFCs are highly volatile chemicals used in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants.
  CFCs slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere and break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
Thought: 
  The passage provides information on the effects of CFCs on ozone depletion and the resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere.
  The passage also mentions the link between ultraviolet light and skin cancer.
  The passage does not provide evidence to support statements A, B, C, or E.
  The passage does suggest that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer by reducing the depletion of the ozone layer, which acts as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to support statement A, which suggests that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  There is no evidence in the passage to support statement B, which suggests that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  There is no evidence in the passage to support statement C, which suggests that few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  There is evidence in the passage to support statement D, which suggests that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  There is no evidence in the passage to support statement E, which suggests that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  Ozone is a toxic form of oxygen that screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere.
  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland showed how CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, and the resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the relationship between ultraviolet light, skin cancer, and the ozone layer, as well as the role of CFCs in ozone depletion.
  A is incorrect because the passage states that "in the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium." This means that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere regardless of whether chlorine is present.
  B is incorrect because the passage does not state that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light. While the passage does state that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer, it does not provide information on the primary cause of skin cancer.
  C is incorrect because the passage does not state that few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D is correct because the passage discusses how the depletion of the ozone layer, caused by CFCs, leads to a decrease in the effectiveness of the ozone layer as a shield against ultraviolet radiation, which contributes to skin cancer. The passage also discusses how the regulation of CFCs contributed to the development of more environmentally friendly chemicals, which indirectly contributes to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E is incorrect because the passage does not state that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as

  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients, the court, and society.
  The passage argues that defense lawyers should not knowingly present false assertions to the court.
  The passage argues that defense lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate the innocence of clients they know to be guilty.
Thought: 
  Lines 7-11 argue that some legal scholars believe that a defense lawyer's obligation is solely to provide the best defense possible, without regard to personal opinions of guilt or innocence.
  Lines 28-31 argue that when lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this, but rather to appraise the case in their client's favor and argue for leniency in sentencing.
  These two statements are in disagreement over whether defense lawyers should undertake to demonstrate the innocence of clients they know to be guilty.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in lines 28-31 to that in lines 7-11 can be described as disagreement over a specific point.
  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism: 
  The relationship between lines 28-31 and lines 7-11 is not hypothetical, as stated in choice C.
  The two statements are not equivalent, as stated in choice E.
  The relationship is not simply the author's opinion opposing another opinion, as stated in choice B.
  The relationship is more specific than general agreement with disagreement over particulars, as stated in choice D.
  However, choice D is still the best answer given the available options.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients, the court, and society.
  Legal scholars argue that the lawyer's sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, without expressing personal opinions or beliefs.
  The lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court/society.
  Lawyers have a duty not to present assertions that they know to be false, and guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation.
Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 state that lawyers should not defend guilty clients by trying to prove their innocence, but should instead argue for leniency in sentencing if they believe it is warranted.
  This relates to the earlier discussion of the lawyer's obligation to the court and society, as lawyers should not present false assertions or insincere representation.
  The author is arguing that lawyers should not take on cases where they know the client is guilty, but should still provide the best defense possible within the bounds of honesty and sincerity.
  The relationship between the two sets of sentences is that they both relate to the lawyer's obligation to the court and society, and the limits of providing the best defense for a client.
  Therefore, the answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: 
  None.

  The passage argues that when lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, they should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  This statement is related to the earlier lines because it argues that defense lawyers have an obligation to the court and society to not present false or insincere representations to the court.
  The earlier lines argue that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, but this obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court/society.
  Therefore, the sentence at lines 28-31 is in agreement with the earlier lines but adds more specificity to the obligation lawyers have to the court and society.
  The relationship between the information contained in the two sentences is that they both relate to the obligation defense lawyers have to the court and society.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 is a particular example of this obligation.
  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism:

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two theories about how neurons communicate with each other in the brain.
  The first theory is that communication between neurons is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses.
  The second theory is that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, through the secretion of a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron.
  The passage describes the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions, which was previously unknown.
  The passage also discusses the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, which are receptors that contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
Thought:
  The passage provides information about two theories about how neurons communicate with each other in the brain, and how the second theory has gained acceptance in the scientific community.
  The passage also describes the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions, which was previously unknown.
  Finally, the passage discusses the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, which are receptors that contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions, and the potential medical applications of this discovery.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the passage is most likely to discuss new support for a widely accepted theory about the workings of the brain.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted, which is by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while a subject performs a cognitive task.
  The resulting image is thought to show the brain regions associated solely with the cognitive task.
  The passage also discusses the modular theory of mind, which posits that mental activity can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules instantiated in localized brain regions.
Thought: 
  The interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while a subject performs a cognitive task.
  The resulting image is thought to show the brain regions associated solely with the cognitive task.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  Of the answer choices, the one that is most analogous to this situation is B: a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  Just as the advertisements were present throughout the year but affected only the summer shoppers, the entire brain is active in both conditions but the FMRI scan is thought to show only the brain regions associated with the cognitive task.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how FMRI scans of brain activity are interpreted.
  FMRI scans are a way of measuring metabolic activity in the brain.
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The resulting image is thought to show the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
Thought:
  The manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are interpreted is most analogous to:
  A: The mayor could not have won without the support of one particular district in the city.
  B: The advertisements affected only the shoppers during the summer months.
  C: The agricultural sector is impacted most severely by droughts because they use more of the water supply.
  D: Most Internet traffic during peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: Most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
  The correct answer must describe a situation where a subset of a larger group is isolated and analyzed to determine its specific characteristics.
  A, B, C, and E do not fit this pattern.
  D is the best answer, as it describes a situation where a subset of Internet traffic (traffic during peak hours) is analyzed to determine its origin (homes rather than office buildings).
Criticism:
  The analogy is not a perfect match, as the interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during a cognitive task, while the origin of Internet traffic is determined by analyzing traffic during peak hours.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of FMRI scans to study brain activity.
  The FMRI scan is a subtractive method that takes a baseline measurement and subtracts it from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The resulting differential brain scan is often interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
Thought: 
  The passage describes the FMRI scan as a subtractive method that takes a baseline measurement and subtracts it from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The resulting differential brain scan is often interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  I need to find an analogy that is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  A, B, C, and D are not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  E is somewhat analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans because it suggests that the cheetah's status as the world's fastest land animal is only true for short distances, and therefore, most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances. Similarly, the interpretation of FMRI scans is that the differential brain scan represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question, when in fact, the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The cheetah is the world's fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Criticism: 
  The analogy is not perfect because it only captures part of the interpretation of FMRI scans, whereas the other answer choices do not capture any of the interpretation. 
  However, it is the most analogous of the answer choices provided.
Action: Answer("E")

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).

  The FMRI scan depicts the differential rate of oxygen use by taking a baseline measurement in the control condition and then subtracting it from the on-task measurement.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement, which is intended to show the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. 
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, which gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The FMRI scan interpretation is most analogous to choice B, which suggests that a store's advertisements affected only the summer shoppers because there was an increase in shoppers only during the summer.
Criticism: 
  Choice B is not a good analogy because it suggests that the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers, but it is possible that the advertisements affected shoppers throughout the year, but the effect was more pronounced during the summer.

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), as a research method in psychology to study the relationship between mental activity and localized brain regions. 
  FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain during a cognitive task compared to a baseline control condition. 
  This method of interpretation obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and may give a false impression of neat functional localization. 
Thought: 
  The question asks for an analogy to the manner in which FMRI scans are typically interpreted. 
  The scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use during a cognitive task compared to a baseline control condition. 
  The interpretation is based on the assumption that whatever remains after the subtraction of the baseline represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. 
  Therefore, the correct analogy would be an example where a particular factor is isolated or subtracted from a larger context to determine its impact or significance. 
  A, B, C, and D do not fit this analogy, as they do not involve the isolation or subtraction of a factor from a larger context. 
  E is the most analogous, as it involves the cheetah's speed being isolated or measured only in short distances, and not over long distances. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. What it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to produce a differential rate of oxygen use. This method produces a false impression of neat functional localization by subtracting out all the distributed brain functions. 
  Choice A: This analogy does not fit the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice B: This analogy does not fit the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice C: This analogy does not fit the interpretation of FMRI scans.

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) as a research method in psychology.
  FMRI scans are interpreted as maps of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI scans are actually the result of a subtraction: the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to show the differential rate of oxygen use.
  The entire brain is active in both conditions, but the subtractive method produces images that give a false impression of neat functional localization.
Thought: 
  The FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The FMRI scans are actually the result of a subtraction: the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to show the differential rate of oxygen use.
  The differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions produce striking images of the brain at work.
  Therefore, the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is most analogous to choice B: a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Criticism: 
  Choice B is not a perfect analogy for the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  While both involve a subtraction or differentiation of some sort, the store's advertising campaign is not a direct comparison to brain activity.
  A better analogy may be choice D: internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.

Action: Answer("C")

The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances, and how secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. The passage also discusses the role of insects in the evolution of secondary substances in plants, and how some secondary substances serve as biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects. The main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. Therefore, the correct answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")

The passage discusses the role of secondary substances in plants, how they give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, and how they evolved as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects. The passage also discusses the evolutionary competition between plants and insects, and how insects have evolved to identify and circumvent the defenses of certain plants. The main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. Therefore, the correct answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")

The passage discusses the evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects and how it has led to the development of secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. The passage explains that some of these substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinating insects to blossoms, while others were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against insects. The passage also explains that insects have evolved ways to circumvent the plants' defenses and that they come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent. Therefore, the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. Thus, the correct answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C")

The main point of the passage is that the distinctive tastes and smells of plants are largely the result of an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects, in which plants have developed secondary substances that serve as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects. The passage describes how these secondary substances have arisen through genetic mutations, but have been conserved by natural selection because they help plants to attract pollinating insects, to defend against plant-eating insects, or to dissuade insects from feeding on them. The passage also describes how insects have evolved ways to circumvent these defenses, leading to a narrowing of the range of suitable food sources for any one species of insect. The best answer is therefore C: "The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects."

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The first version of multicultural education advocates teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values.
  The second version of multicultural education advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this version are still identifiably Western.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first because it still relies on Western scientific methods.
  To provide the strongest objection to this criticism, we need to find a statement that suggests that it is possible to understand non-Western cultures without relying on Western scientific methods.
  Choice A is incorrect because it suggests that adopting the perspectives and methods of a culture is impossible, which weakens the objection to the criticism.
  Choice B is incorrect because it suggests that non-Western societies are similar to each other, but it does not address the issue of understanding them without relying on Western scientific methods.
  Choice C is incorrect because it suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures with different values, but it does not address the issue of understanding them without relying on Western scientific methods.
  Choice D is incorrect because it suggests that understanding Western culture requires Western scientific investigations, which is not relevant to the objection to the criticism.
  Choice E is the best answer because it suggests that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, which supports the idea that adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture being studied is necessary for understanding it.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, but from within the context of the majority culture's values.
  The second version holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still uses Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Critics argue that both versions are problematic because they involve a commitment to certain values.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first version because it still involves a commitment to Western scientific values.
  To rebut this criticism, we need to find an option that shows that the second version is essentially different from the first version.
  Option A is irrelevant because it discusses the possibility of adopting the perspectives and methods of a culture, which is not the main issue in the passage.
  Option B is also irrelevant because it discusses similarities between non-Western societies, which is not the main issue in the passage.
  Option C is also irrelevant because it discusses the use of non-Western value systems to study other cultures, which is not the main issue in the passage.
  Option D is irrelevant because it discusses the understanding of Western culture's achievements, which is not the main issue in the passage.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it discusses the necessity of understanding another culture, which is not the main issue in the passage.
  None of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Criticism: 
  The options are irrelevant to the main issue in the passage and do not provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version advocates teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values.
  The second version advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures and using Western scientific methods to study cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that Western scientific methods are already value-laden and that understanding another culture requires adopting that culture's perspectives and methods.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first version, as it still uses Western scientific methods.
  To provide a strong objection to this criticism, we need to show that the second version is essentially different from the first version.
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  If this is true, then the second version of multicultural education could be different from the first version, as it could involve using the value systems of the cultures being studied.
  Therefore, option C provides the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
The first version teaches about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture, using the values of liberalism.
The second version takes a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures and uses Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
Criticism of the second version argues that Western scientific methods are already value-laden and that understanding other cultures requires adopting their perspectives and methods.
Thought:
The strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would be one that challenges the idea that understanding other cultures requires adopting their perspectives and methods.
Option A suggests that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture, which would support the criticism of the second version.
Option B suggests that many non-Western societies have similar value systems, but this is not relevant to the criticism of the second version.
Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, but this does not address the criticism of the second version.
Option D suggests that understanding Western achievements requires scientific investigation, but this is not relevant to the criticism of the second version.
Option E suggests that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, which supports the criticism of the second version.
Therefore, none of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education and their criticisms.
  The first version proposes teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values of liberalism.

Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not different from the first version because using Western scientific methods to study other cultures involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  To overcome this criticism, a strong objection would be that it is possible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture without being a member of that culture.
  Choice A provides such an objection and is therefore the correct answer.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms, but still uses Western methods of examination.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that the methods used are still Western and thus value-laden.
  To counter this criticism, it would need to be shown that the methods used are not value-laden or that using non-Western methods is not necessary for understanding other cultures.
  Option A is not relevant because it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option B is not relevant because it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option C is also not relevant because it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option D is not relevant because it discusses Western achievements and not the methods of understanding other cultures.
  Option E is also not relevant because it is a statement of fact, not an argument.
  None of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Criticism: 
  The options do not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal advocates teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture.
  The second proposal advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures and using Western scientific methods to study cultures.
  Critics argue that the second proposal is not essentially different from the first because Western scientific methods are value-laden and do not allow for understanding of non-scientific cultures.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second proposal is that Western scientific methods are value-laden and do not allow for understanding of non-scientific cultures.
  To provide the strongest objection to this criticism, we need to show that Western scientific methods can be used to understand non-scientific cultures.
  Option A is irrelevant to the objection.
  Option B is also irrelevant because similarity among non-Western societies does not address the criticism.
  Option C is also irrelevant because using one's own value system does not address the criticism.
  Option D is also irrelevant because it is not related to the objection.
  Option E, on the other hand, supports the objection because it suggests that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. This implies that Western scientific methods may not be sufficient for understanding other cultures.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education is Option E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values.
  The second version holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms, but still uses Western scientific methods to study and explain cultures.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first because it still uses Western scientific methods, which are value-laden and distort other cultures.
  To provide the strongest objection to this criticism, we need to find an option that shows that it is possible to understand other cultures without using Western scientific methods.
  Option A is not helpful because it suggests that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  Option B is also not helpful because it suggests that many non-Western societies have similar value systems, but it does not address the issue of using Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures with different values, but it does not address whether it is possible to understand other cultures without using Western scientific methods.
  Option D is not helpful because it suggests that students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations, but it does not address the issue of understanding other cultures.
  Option E suggests that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, which supports the idea that understanding other cultures is important. However, it does not address whether it is possible to understand other cultures without using Western scientific methods.
  None of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education. 
  The second version of multicultural education advocates for a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures. 
  Critics argue that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. 
  Critics argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is based on the argument that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this version are still identifiably Western. 
  If there is a way to study other cultures that is not identifiably Western, then this objection to the second version of multicultural education would be weakened. 
  Therefore, option C, which suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version advocates teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values.
  The second version advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and using Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that Western scientific methods are already value-laden and that adopting non-Western perspectives and methods is necessary for genuine understanding.
Thought:
  The question asks for the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  The criticism is that Western scientific methods are already value-laden and that adopting non-Western perspectives and methods is necessary for genuine understanding.
  Therefore, the strongest objection would be one that challenges the idea that non-Western perspectives and methods are necessary for genuine understanding.
  Choice A is not a strong objection because it simply restates the criticism.
  Choice B is not a strong objection because it does not address the issue of whether non-Western perspectives and methods are necessary for genuine understanding.
  Choice C is not a strong objection because it suggests that some non-Western societies do use their own value system when studying other cultures, but it does not address the issue of whether non-Western perspectives and methods are necessary for genuine understanding.
  Choice D is not a strong objection because it is not relevant to the issue of whether non-Western perspectives and methods are necessary for genuine understanding.
  Choice E is a strong objection because it supports the idea that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, which suggests that non-Western perspectives and methods may be necessary for genuine understanding.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience

Thought: 
  The question asks for something that is disturbing in a way that is analogous to Schoenberg's music. 
  The passage suggests that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths and delves into previously unrecorded emotional states.
  Of the choices, the one that is most analogous to this is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.

  Therefore, the answer should be something that similarly delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that have not been previously expressed.
  Option A, vulgar humor, does not fit this description.
  Option B, humor that shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, could be seen as analogous to Schoenberg's music in that it is exploring emotional states that have not been previously expressed.
  Option C, material already made famous by other comedians, does not fit this description.
  Option D, extreme political philosophy, does not fit this description.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
  D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  E: "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone not from the Border region.

  The passage also explains that corridos are composed of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another, and that their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that most complete corridos have some lines in common.
  The passage does not provide any support for the other answer choices.
  Therefore, the answer is C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that all complete corridos have some lines in common.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.

The body does not produce an immune response to prions, and there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves. CJD is inevitably fatal.
Thought: 
  The author discusses the discovery of prions as a new type of pathogen that causes CJD, a fatal disease. The author emphasizes the lack of natural defense against prions in the body and the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves. The author also notes that prions are believed to be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Given this information, the author would be least likely to agree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide any information to suggest that any patients infected with CJD will recover from the disease. In fact, the passage emphasizes that CJD is inevitably fatal and that there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves. However, the author would be least likely to agree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease, rather than disagree with it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans caused by a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein, called a prion.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain.
  Prions possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape, which leads to the formation of plaques that collect in the brain and ultimately destroy nerve cells.
  The body does not produce an immune response when prions are present.
Thought:
  The author would be least likely to agree with a statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage.
  A: The passage states that prions cause CJD by converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape, which leads to the formation of plaques that collect in the brain and ultimately destroy nerve cells. Therefore, the author would likely agree that the presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease. 
  B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Therefore, the author would not agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: The passage states that the disease agent responsible for CJD is a prion, which lacks nucleic acid and consists mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Therefore, the author would agree that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The passage states that the body does not produce an immune response when prions are present. Therefore, the author would agree that the body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: The passage states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood. Therefore, the author would agree that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
  The statement that the author would be least likely to agree with is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease, as the passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  Prions are different from other pathogens because they lack nucleic acid and consist mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  Prions can reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  CJD is inevitably fatal, and there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
Thought:
  The author discusses the discovery of prions and their role in causing CJD.
  The author describes prions as a new type of protein pathogen that can reproduce themselves in an unexpected way.
  The author emphasizes that CJD is inevitably fatal and that there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
  Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with choice B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism:
  The author does not mention anything about patients currently infected with CJD recovering from the disease.
  CJD is described as inevitably fatal, and there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia caused by a pathogen called a prion.
  Prions are a type of protein pathogen that lack nucleic acid and reproduce by inducing other prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions occur naturally in the body and are capable of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape that destroys nerve cells in the brain.
Thought:
  The author would be least likely to agree with a statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage.
  A: The passage states that prions cause CJD by destroying nerve cells in the brain, which is consistent with the presence of abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue.
  B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, which contradicts the possibility of patients recovering from the disease.
  C: The passage describes prions as a type of pathogen that lack nucleic acid and reproduce by inducing other prions to transform themselves, which supports the idea that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The passage states that the body does not produce an immune response to prions, which suggests that the body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: The passage states that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce, which supports the idea that the author would agree with this statement.
  Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions as a new type of protein pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  Prions are proteins that can exist harmlessly in the body, but can transform into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation that reproduces itself by inducing other normally shaped prions to transform as well.
  The body does not produce an immune response to prions, and there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
Thought: 
  The author describes the discovery of prions and their link to CJD in detail, and the passage suggests that prions are a new type of infectious pathogen that can cause serious neurological disease.
  The author also notes that there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, and that the body does not produce an immune response to prions.
  Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with choice B, which suggests that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism: 
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
  The passage does not suggest that any patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans.
  CJD is a degenerative form of dementia that causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, resulting in extensive nerve cell death.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, but they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape.
  Prions reproduce themselves in an unexpected way by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Because prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
Thought: 
  The author would be least likely to agree with a statement that contradicts the information presented in the passage.
  A: The passage describes how abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue cause CJD, so this statement is consistent with the passage.
  B: The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, so this statement contradicts the information presented in the passage.
  C: The passage describes how prions reproduce without nucleic acid, so this statement is consistent with the passage.
  D: The passage states that the body does not produce an immune response to prions, so this statement is consistent with the passage.
  E: The passage describes how scientists have yet to fully understand the mechanism by which prions reproduce, so this statement is consistent with the passage.
  Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with statement B, "Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease."
Criticism: 
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, so statement B contradicts the information presented in the passage.
  However, the passage does not provide evidence or information to contradict any of the other statements.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes and its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia.
  Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  This new type of protein pathogen is called "prion".
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain.
  Prions possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape.
  Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way.
  Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
Thought: 
  The author is likely to agree with the presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease because the passage states that prions exhibiting abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, which ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  The author would not agree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease because the passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
  The author would agree with the statement that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction because the passage states that the pathogen responsible for CJD is a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  The author would agree with the statement that the body has no natural defense against CJD because the passage states that because prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  The author would agree with the statement that scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce because the passage states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
  Therefore, the author would be LEAST likely to agree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.

Thought: 
  The question asks which response would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  A: The waiter concealing a large part of his tip income to reduce his taxes is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as he is trying to maximize his overall satisfaction by reducing his tax burden.
  B: The motorist avoiding speeding on a heavily patrolled road to avoid losing her driver's license is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as she is trying to avoid the economic disincentive of losing her license.
  C: The industrialist continuing to illegally discharge pollutants into a river because the cost of treatment exceeds the fine is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as he is trying to minimize his costs and maximize profits.
  D: The government official risking prosecution for soliciting bribes due to inadequate government salary is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as she is trying to maximize her overall satisfaction by seeking additional income to support herself and her family.
  E: The worker physically assaulting his former supervisor due to perceived unfair dismissal is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, as it is not an action that seeks to maximize overall satisfaction or minimize costs.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that the utility maximization principle applies only to deliberate crimes, so it is possible that the worker's action could be seen as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives if the worker believes that the physical assault will lead to a better economic outcome than other available options.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.
  D: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  E: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style was late-Romantic, charged with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style pushed unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  The third style was the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
Thought: 
  The author describes each of the three styles in detail and notes that Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory.
  The author highlights Schoenberg's technical mastery in all three styles and notes that his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow as his career progressed.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style was late-Romantic music with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style was characterized by unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  The third style was developed as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it, known as the 12-tone technique.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that each of Schoenberg's styles represented a natural progression from the previous one.
  The first style was a late-Romantic style, and it is logical that Schoenberg would move away from that style as he developed his own voice.
  The second style is a logical progression from the first because it takes the instability of the first style to its logical extreme.
  The third style is a logical progression from the second because it seeks to bring order to the instability of the second style.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that each style represents a natural progression from the previous one.

  The passage discusses the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style is late-Romantic, music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style pushed unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  The third style developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
Thought: 
  The passage states that Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery in all three styles.
  The author also notes that Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  This is because Schoenberg was constantly pushing the boundaries of music and developing new techniques to express what he was compelled to express.
  The second and third styles represent a natural progression from the first because they build on and extend the techniques developed in the previous style.
  The author also notes that Schoenberg's music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow as his career progressed.
  However, the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: The author refers. to the early days of biotechnology (line 38) primarily in order to
Choices:
  A: furnish a brief account of the evolution of academic biotechnology research
  B: establish that present competitive practices in biotechnology research are not entirely unprecedented

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)
  B: "highly diverse" (line 10)

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism
  D: admiration for its subtle critique of contemporary culture
  E: appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  The author also argues that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  If there are industries where larger businesses are not able to achieve lower costs than smaller businesses, then the author's argument would be undermined.
  Answer choice D suggests that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  If this is true, then it is possible that in some industries, larger businesses are not able to achieve lower costs than smaller businesses.
  Therefore, answer choice D would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory represents the idea that there are increasing returns to scale, meaning that larger businesses can achieve greater efficiency and productivity.
  However, increasing returns can lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly, as larger businesses can achieve lower costs and drive smaller businesses out of the market.
  The Invisible Hand represents the idea that a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading to competition and reasonable prices.
Thought: 
  The author connects increased size to monopoly power through the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  If there were evidence that larger businesses did not necessarily lead to monopoly power, then the author's argument would be weakened.
  Choice A suggests that larger businesses in some industries do not necessarily lead to monopoly power in all regions, which weakens the author's argument.
  Therefore, choice A is the best answer.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  The invisible hand works properly when there are many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
Thought:
  The question asks for the answer that would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
  A: This answer choice does not undermine the connection because it acknowledges that larger businesses can exist in the same industry in different regions. 
  B: This answer choice is not directly related to the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It discusses the effect of narrower tasks on worker salaries.
  C: This answer choice reinforces the idea that larger businesses can exert monopoly power, which undermines the connection between increased size and competition.
  D: This answer choice does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it acknowledges that the size needed to achieve increasing returns varies by industry. 
  E: This answer choice is not directly related to the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It discusses the potential drawbacks of increasing specialization.
  Therefore, answer choice C is the most likely answer to undermine the connection between increased size and competition.
Criticism: 
  There is no obvious flaw in the thought process used to arrive at answer choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that there is a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory refers to the concept of increasing returns to scale and specialization.
  Increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly.
  The Invisible Hand refers to the idea that self-interest can lead to the common good.
  The Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power, which undermines the Invisible Hand.
  Therefore, any statement that undermines the connection between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power would weaken the author's argument.
  A, C, and E do not undermine the connection between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
  B is irrelevant to the argument.
  D suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely, which weakens the argument that increasing returns to scale always lead to monopoly power.
  Therefore, D is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that there is a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory represents increasing returns to scale, which can lead to monopoly power.
  The Invisible Hand represents the idea that self-interest can lead to the common good, but it requires many competitors in each industry to work properly.
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power, which undermines the Invisible Hand.
  Therefore, any statement that weakens the connection between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power would undermine the author's argument.
  A, C, and E all suggest that monopoly power can still exist despite larger businesses achieving increasing returns to scale.
  B is about the workers' salaries and does not directly relate to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  D suggests that the relationship between increased size and increasing returns to scale is not straightforward, which weakens the author's argument that increasing returns to scale inevitably lead to monopoly power.
  Therefore, D is the answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that the Pin Factory concept of increasing returns to scale creates a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The author also argues that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The question asks which answer choice would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
  A: This answer choice suggests that there are other factors besides size that can allow a business to exert monopoly power, so it would not necessarily undermine the author's argument about the connection between size and monopoly power.
  B: This answer choice is about worker salaries and does not relate to the connection between size and monopoly power.
  C: This answer choice suggests that businesses collude to set prices, which would undermine the idea of a free market with many competitors, but it does not necessarily undermine the author's argument about the connection between size and monopoly power.
  D: This answer choice suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. If this were true, it would suggest that not all industries are prone to monopoly power as a result of increasing returns to scale. This would weaken the author's argument about the connection between size and monopoly power.
  E: This answer choice suggests that there may be other factors that offset the gains in productivity achieved by making workers more specialized. This would weaken the author's argument about the benefits of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, answer choice D would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that there is a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory refers to the idea that there are increasing returns to scale, and the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more productive it can be.
  The Invisible Hand refers to the idea that a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention."
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  If there are industries where larger businesses do not have a significant advantage over smaller businesses, then the connection between increased size and monopoly power would be undermined.
  Answer choice A suggests that there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  This suggests that the size of a business is not the only factor that determines whether it can achieve lower costs and exert monopoly power.
  Therefore, Answer choice A would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Criticism:
  Answer choice C also suggests that larger businesses may not necessarily have a monopoly power, as smaller businesses can collude to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  However, this does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, as it is still possible for larger businesses to achieve lower costs and dominate the market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The author argues that the Pin Factory concept, which emphasizes increasing returns to scale, is opposed to the concept of the Invisible Hand, which assumes many competitors to prevent monopoly power.
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which undermines the idea of the Invisible Hand.
  Therefore, any statement that undermines the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power would weaken the author's argument.
  Choice A talks about businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one region even though there are larger businesses in other regions. This statement does not undermine the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power, and it is not relevant to the author's argument.
  Choice B is about workers' salaries and is not relevant to the author's argument.
  Choice C talks about collusion among businesses, which is a form of monopoly power. This statement reinforces the author's argument.
  Choice D talks about the size that a business must reach to achieve increasing returns. This statement does not undermine the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power, and it is not relevant to the author's argument.
  Choice E talks about offsetting factors that may reduce gains in productivity achieved by making workers more specialized. This statement does not undermine the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power, and it is not relevant to the author's argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. 
Thought: 
  The question asks which answer would most undermine the connection the author draws between increased size and monopoly power. 
  A: This answer choice does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It actually reinforces it by saying that in some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions. 
  B: This answer choice talks about the effect of specialization on worker salaries and does not address the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
  C: This answer choice reinforces the connection between increased size and monopoly power by saying that when an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would. 
  D: This answer choice does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. It actually reinforces it by saying that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. 
  E: This answer choice does not address the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
  Therefore, none of the answer choices undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The Pin Factory example shows how increased size can lead to increased efficiency and productivity.
Thought: 
  If there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions, then the connection between increased size and monopoly power is weakened.
  Answer A suggests that the size of the business may not be the only factor that determines whether a business has monopoly power.
  Therefore, answer A would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society

He believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it, and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  E: The passage states that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but that his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
  The radical critics maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society.

  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Dostoyevsky took a different position than the radical critics in Russian literary criticism.
  The radical critics believed that art should be useful and serve a political view.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality was different.
  He believed that there was no distinction between fantasy and reality and that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it.
  He believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  He believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed that reality was not independent of the experiences of individuals.
  He believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it.
  Therefore, the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  He also believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world, which suggests that he did not believe that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality.
  He believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," which suggests that he did not believe that realism was unequal to the task of representing political views.
  He did not explicitly state that realism does not facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society, but he did not believe that art should be useful or serve a particular political view.
  He did believe that reality was literature's crucial source, which suggests that he did not believe that reality was not the crucial source of successful literature.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct.
  The passage explicitly states that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it and that the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for him.
  He did not believe that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality or that realism was unequal to the task of representing political views.
  He did not explicitly state that realism does not facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society, but he did not believe that art should be useful or serve a particular political view.

  Dostoyevsky had a unique view of realism in literature.
  He believed that reality was not limited to the tangible, but also included the fantastic.
  He rejected the idea that art must serve a particular political view.
  He believed that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit.
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.

  The answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. Good job!
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Dostoyevsky took a third position on the debate between two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday.
  The radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Dostoyevsky believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
  Dostoyevsky defined artistry as the ability to write well.
  The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.
  Dostoyevsky believed that sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality is the crucial source of successful literature.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment
Response 0:

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification, including uncertainty about how often it occurs, insufficient evidence for a reasoned decision, and the jury's lack of accountability and obligation to consider the effects of their decision. 
  Passage B suggests that jury nullification can be a useful safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous, and can also help to indicate to the legislature when a law may be unjust or problematic. It also suggests that instances of nullification based on factors that should be ignored are likely to be uncommon.
Thought: 
  The authors of both passages agree that jury nullification can be problematic and that juries lack accountability and obligation to consider the effects of their decision. 
  However, they differ in their views on whether jury nullification can be a useful safety valve and whether it is within the purview of juries to interpret the law. 
  Passage A suggests that the jury should not be interpreting the law, while Passage B suggests that jury nullification can help to indicate to the legislature when a law may be unjust or problematic.
Criticism: 
  None of the passages suggest that the authors would disagree over whether juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts, whether laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people, or whether elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are. 
  Therefore, none of the choices are correct.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.

  E: The passage does not suggest that scientists who oppose patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative.
Thought: 
  The author argues that concerns about patent holders preventing basic research are overstated, and that patents can actually spur innovation.
  The author also suggests that the cost of patent litigation and a tradition of respecting a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement are factors that mitigate concerns about patent holders preventing basic research.
  The author does not suggest that corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees or that scientists who oppose patenting do so because their work is not innovative.
  The author does acknowledge that some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in restrictions on access to those materials, but argues that this fear is unfounded.
  Based on this, the author would most likely agree with statement C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Criticism: 
  The author does not state that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check, only that it could be a deterrent.
  The author also acknowledges that some researchers have concerns about restrictions on access to biological materials, but argues that these concerns are unfounded.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of patents in biotechnology and their potential impact on basic research. 
  The author discusses concerns about restrictions on access to research materials and fears that patent holders may try to prevent further research through legal action.
Thought: 
  The author argues that concerns about patents hindering basic research are overblown.
  The author notes that patents provide an incentive for innovation and that there is a tradition of allowing noncommercial research exceptions to patent infringement.
  The author also notes that patent litigation is expensive and generally only initiated to protect a market position.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the debate over whether biotechnology patents hinder basic research by restricting access to research materials, such as genetic sequences and cell lines.
  The passage argues that patents provide an incentive for innovation and that enforcing patents against noncommercial research is unlikely.
Thought: 
  The author argues that patents actually spur basic research by providing an incentive to innovate, and that enforcing patents against noncommercial research is unlikely. 
  The author also suggests that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, but this is not necessarily problematic. 
  None of the answer choices directly address these points, but choice C comes closest by suggesting that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might try to prevent researchers from using patented materials.
Criticism: 
  While the author does mention the cost of patent litigation as a potential barrier to enforcement against noncommercial research, this is only one of several reasons why such enforcement is unlikely. 
  The author's main argument is that patents provide an incentive for innovation and that enforcing patents against noncommercial research is unlikely. 
  Therefore, choice C does not fully capture the author's perspective.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, which is the power of negative evidence. 
  The passage highlights the importance of searching for negative evidence to disprove theories, and that a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable.
  Passage B describes how astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The passage explains how the astronomers changed their assumptions when their predictions were not borne out, and how the discovery of Neptune confirmed their new assumptions.
  The passage also describes how the prediction of the orbit of Mercury was not initially borne out, leading to the hypothesis of the existence of another planet, and how Einstein's general theory of relativity eventually confirmed the old auxiliary assumptions.
Thought: 
  The question asks which of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A.
  According to passage A, auxiliary premises are often used to derive a theory's predictions, and these premises may include the correct functioning of instrumentation, the absence of disturbing forces, etc.
  In passage B, the astronomers made predictions about Uranus based on auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  They changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Therefore, the answer must be C: Neptune, as its existence was an auxiliary assumption that was changed when the astronomers' predictions were not borne out.

  Passage B discusses the discovery of the planet Uranus and the subsequent attempts by astronomers to predict its orbit, as well as the later attempts to predict the orbit of Mercury.
  A disturbing force, as described in Passage A, refers to one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists often need to derive a theory's predictions, and which can cause a prediction to fail if it is incorrect.
Thought: 
  In Passage B, the astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, one of which was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When their predictions were incorrect, they changed their assumptions and hypothesized the existence of another planet, which was later discovered and named Neptune.
  This suggests that the failure of their prediction was due to a disturbing force - in this case, the gravitational pull of Neptune, which was not accounted for in their original assumptions.
  None of the other choices in the question are discussed in Passage B in this context.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.

In Passage B, the astronomers based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. 
  The passage does not mention any of the options as a disturbing force except for one that may be considered as such. The moon is not mentioned in the passage, and it is irrelevant to the discussion. Uranus, the sun, Neptune, and Mercury are all mentioned, but none of them are described as a disturbing force. 
  However, the discovery of Neptune is described as the result of astronomers changing their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. This change in assumptions is an example of a disturbing force because it is an auxiliary premise that appeals to other theories.

  Passage A mentions that auxiliary premises are needed to derive a theory's predictions and that negative evidence is rarely conclusive.
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force as described in Passage A.
Thought: 
  In Passage A, a disturbing force is an auxiliary premise that can affect the outcome of an experiment and lead to a failed prediction.
  In Passage B, the astronomers made predictions about Uranus' orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the existence of other planets.
  The assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus was one of the auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers later changed their assumption about the existence of other planets to account for the observed orbit of Uranus.
  This change in assumption suggests that the existence of another planet was a disturbing force that affected the prediction of Uranus' orbit.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention of a disturbing force in Passage B. 
  The astronomers changed their assumption about the existence of other planets to account for the observed orbit of Uranus, but this does not necessarily mean that the existence of Neptune was a disturbing force.

  Passage B describes the discovery of Uranus and the failed predictions of its orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  Passage B also describes the failed predictions of Mercury's orbit based on Newton's laws and the hypothesis of the existence of another planet called Vulcan.
Thought: 
  According to passage A, when predictions fail, there is usually more than one possible explanation, and one of the possible explanations is the presence of disturbing forces. 
  In passage B, the auxiliary assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus was incorrect, leading to the failed prediction of its orbit. 
  This incorrect auxiliary assumption can be considered a disturbing force, as it affected the prediction of Uranus' orbit.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Uranus.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in Passage B that the incorrect auxiliary assumption about the existence of other planets was due to a disturbing force. 
  It is possible that the astronomers simply did not have enough information about the other planets in the vicinity of Uranus at the time. 
  Therefore, while the incorrect auxiliary assumption did affect the prediction of Uranus' orbit, it may not necessarily be considered a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science, specifically the power of negative evidence.
  Popper believes that scientific research involves generating bold theories and searching for evidence that would disprove them.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the attempts to predict its orbit using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets when their predictions did not match their observations.
  The failure of the predictions could have been due to an error in the auxiliary assumptions, including the presence of disturbing forces.
Thought:
  Passage A mentions that auxiliary premises, which can include assumptions about the absence of disturbing forces, are often needed to derive a theory's predictions.
  Passage B discusses the astronomers' attempts to predict the orbit of Uranus using auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets when their predictions did not match their observations.
  This suggests that the failure of their predictions could have been due to an error in one or more of the auxiliary assumptions, including the presence of disturbing forces.
  Therefore, the answer is not Uranus, the sun, Neptune, or Mercury, but rather E: the moon, which is a potential source of disturbing forces on the orbits of planets.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's views on the power of negative evidence in science.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the subsequent search for an explanation of its orbit.
  The astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the prediction failed, the astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets.
Thought: 
  The question asks which of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A.
  According to passage A, auxiliary assumptions can include "the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc."
  In passage B, the astronomers made auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun, the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets, and the existence of other planets in the vicinity of Uranus.
  The failure of their prediction could be due to an error in any of these assumptions, including the assumption about the absence of disturbing forces.
  None of the choices directly relate to disturbing forces, but the presence of any of the objects could potentially cause disturbing forces that would affect the orbit of Uranus.
  Therefore, the best answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contributions to the philosophy of science and the power of negative evidence.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the subsequent discovery of Neptune, as well as the prediction of the orbit of Mercury.
  Disturbing forces are mentioned in passage A as one of the auxiliary premises that scientists use to derive a theory's predictions.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force, as described in passage A.
  The only answer choice that could potentially be a disturbing force is E: the moon.
  However, the moon is not mentioned in passage B, and there is no indication that it played a role in the discovery of Uranus, Neptune, or the prediction of Mercury's orbit.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices clearly illustrate a disturbing force as described in passage A.
  Since none of the answer choices are correct, the most likely answer is D: Mercury, since it is the only planet mentioned in passage B that is an answer choice.
Criticism: 
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force, but none of the answer choices clearly fit that description.
  The answer choice D: Mercury is not a disturbing force, but rather the planet whose orbit was predicted and found to be incorrect.
  Therefore, the question is poorly written and does not have a correct answer.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.

Choices:
  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.

  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  The answer is A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  While Dostoyevsky did believe that reality was more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world, it is not clear from the passage that he would have agreed with the specific statement that art should stand high above the present and the everyday because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.

Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  He believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  This is because this view maintains that art should be distinct from reality, whereas Dostoyevsky believed that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Therefore, the answer is D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Criticism:
  The statement "It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy" is not entirely accurate.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  However, it is not clear from the passage that he would disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday solely because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  Therefore, another answer choice may be equally plausible.

  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would disagree with the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.
  The answer is C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
Criticism:
  You are correct that Dostoyevsky never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source.
  However, the question asks about the view that art should stand high above the present and the everyday, not whether reality is the foundation of all literature.
  The answer is A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.

  The answer is not C because Dostoyevsky did not believe that reality must be the foundation of all literature; rather, he believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  The answer is not D because Dostoyevsky believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world, which suggests that he did not make a clear distinction between reality and fantasy.
  The answer is not E because Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit" and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms.
  Therefore, the answer must be B because Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source and that reality was far more than the merely tangible, which suggests that he would agree that the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The discovery of nuclear fission took a while to be recognized by scientists.
  Between 1934 to 1939, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
Thought: 
  Physicists did not recognize the significance of the data for a long time.
  If physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they might have been more open to the possibility of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, if true, B would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists conducted experiments on neutron bombardment of uranium and discovered evidence of nuclear fission.
  The physicists did not recognize the significance of their findings until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
Thought: 
  Physicists did not recognize the significance of their findings because they were not receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission could happen in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments.
  Theoretical calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms apart were available prior to the neutron-bombardment experiments.
  Therefore, if the physicists conducting the experiments had been aware of these theoretical calculations, they may have recognized the significance of their findings sooner.
  Choice C suggests that the physicists conducting the experiments had not been aware of the theoretical calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  Therefore, choice C is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists discovered nuclear fission between 1934 and 1939, but did not realize they were witnessing it until 1939.
  Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart before the neutron-bombardment experiments.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
Thought: 
  Physicists had already produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart before the neutron-bombardment experiments.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  The physicists had certain expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, which caused them to overlook the significance of the data.
  If the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the nuclear composition of the by-products, they might have been more open to considering the possibility of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, B might be the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that B would be the most likely answer to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  While it is true that the physicists had certain expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, it is not clear that this was the main factor that caused them to overlook the significance of the data.
  Additionally, the passage does not provide enough information to evaluate the other answer choices.

  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that led to the realization that atoms were being split.
  To reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split, something would have had to change to help them make the right conceptual link.
  Option A, the physicists using the same research techniques, is unlikely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Option B, the physicists not having particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, is also unlikely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Option C, the physicists not being aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, is also unlikely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Option D, more physicists concentrating on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium, could have increased the chances of recognizing the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Option E, physicists conducting experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium, is unlikely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split because uranium was the substance that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, the most likely option to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split is D, more physicists concentrating on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?
Choices:

Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The first position maintains that art is above the present and everyday.
  The second position maintains that art must find its sources in concrete reality and be useful.
  The third position, held by Dostoyevsky, maintains that reality is literature's crucial source and that reality is far more than the merely tangible. He believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The first two positions are presented and elaborated in detail.
  The third position, held by Dostoyevsky, is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that the third position is differentiated from the second one. In fact, the third position differs from both the first and the second positions. 
  Therefore, the answer should be B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses three significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The first position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday.
  The second position maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society.
  The third position, which Dostoyevsky took, was that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.

Response 3:
The answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. 

Explanation: The passage presents three different positions on the role of literature and art in society. The first two positions are described in the opening sentences of the passage, and the third position is then introduced as Dostoyevsky's own viewpoint. The rest of the passage is dedicated to explaining how Dostoyevsky's position differs from the first two, and how his understanding of reality and artistry is more nuanced than that of the radical critics. Therefore, the third position is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The first position believed that art should stand above the present and everyday, while the second position believed that art should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses three different positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time. 
  The first position maintains that art should stand above the present and the everyday. 
  The second position maintains that art should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society. 
  The third position, taken by Dostoyevsky, is that reality is the crucial source of literature, but reality is not limited to the tangible and there is no distinction between fantasy and reality. 
  Dostoyevsky also believes that art should not be judged based on its usefulness or political message, but rather on its artistic merit. 
Thought: 
  The passage discusses three different positions in Russian literary criticism. 
  The first two positions are presented briefly, while the third position, taken by Dostoyevsky, is elaborated in detail. 
  The third position is differentiated from the first two, as Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality and the role of art differs significantly from the other two positions. 
  The passage does not suggest that the third position is superior or inferior to the other two, but rather presents it as a distinct perspective. 
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Criticism: 
  The thought process is correct. 
  However, it should be noted that while the first two positions are presented briefly, they are still elaborated to some extent.

  The first position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday.
  The second position maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, and he believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit and that art must not be assigned a particular political view.
  The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes the theory of evolutionary psychology and how it explains human behavior from the standpoint of evolution.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" that imputes interests (the proliferation of genes) to the agent of the behavior that they may not be aware of.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing interests to agents of behavior that they may not be aware of.
  The assertion from Passage A that best exemplifies this criticism is that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This is because it suggests that seemingly altruistic behavior is actually driven by genes seeking to propagate themselves, rather than a conscious desire to promote the well-being of others.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  However, it is worth noting that the author of Passage B does not necessarily disagree with the assertion in Passage A that genes may promote their self-propagation through apparently altruistic behavior.
  Rather, the criticism is that evolutionary psychology tends to overemphasize the role of genetic interests in explaining behavior, to the exclusion of other possible explanations.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the study of Native American autobiographies.
  The passage explains that scholars have focused on written autobiographies that were created through collaboration between Native American and non-Native American authors.
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the collaboration between Native American and non-Native American authors in creating written autobiographies.
  The collaboration results in a composite product that reflects the contributions of both cultures.
  Therefore, the answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism:
  The answer choice A is close to the correct answer, but it is not accurate because the artifacts and oral traditions are not necessarily the basis of the written autobiography. 
  Answer choice D is also close, but it is not accurate because the original author may not have been Native American, and the editor may not have been non-Native American.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used in line 5 of the passage.
  The passage discusses the autobiographies of Native Americans.
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to life histories of Native Americans that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The term "composite" suggests that these life histories were created by multiple authors, at least one of whom is from a different culture than the subject of the autobiography.
  The term "bicultural" suggests that the collaborators are from two different cultures.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of most scholars' studies of Native American autobiographies, which have focused on "as-told-to life histories" that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. These scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history and have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used in line 5 to describe the "as-told-to life histories" that most scholars have focused on. The phrase suggests that these life histories are the products of collaboration between Native American storytellers and non-Native American collaborators, who translated, recorded, and edited the stories. The use of the word "composite" implies that the finished product is a combination of contributions from both cultures. The use of the word "bicultural" suggests that the collaborators come from two different cultures. Therefore, the answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" suggests that the finished product is a combination of contributions from both cultures. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the Native American storytellers contributed to the writing of the life histories; it only states that the life histories were "solicited, translated, recorded, and edited" by non-Native American collaborators. Therefore, it is possible that the finished product was not a true collaboration between the two cultures. Additionally, the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" does not suggest that the life histories were written originally by a member of one culture; it only suggests that the finished product is a combination of contributions from two cultures. Therefore, the answer may not be D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of focusing only on written, as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
  It introduces the term "bicultural composite authorship" in line 5 to describe these written life histories.
Thought: 
  The term "bicultural composite authorship" refers to written life histories of Native Americans that were created in collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators.
  The use of the term "composite" suggests that the finished product is a combination of contributions from both cultures.
  The use of the term "bicultural" suggests that the collaboration involves two cultures.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The answer is not A because the written life histories may have been created entirely by non-Native American collaborators, not based on artifacts and oral traditions of another culture.
  The answer is not C because the identities of the authors are known, and they come from two cultures.
  The answer is not D because the written life histories may have been created by Native Americans themselves, not just edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The answer is not E because the written life histories may not be based on oral communication by a member of another culture, but rather on written communication between collaborators from different cultures.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the study of autobiographies of Native Americans and how scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. 
  The scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. 
  The passage also mentions that prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures, Native American cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that the written autobiographies of Native Americans were created through a collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators. 
  The collaboration was bicultural because it involved people from two different cultures, and composite because it involved the combination of different contributions from different people. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" does not necessarily imply that the written autobiographies were edited and revised by non-Native American collaborators. 
  It simply refers to the fact that the autobiographies were created through a collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators. 
  Therefore, the answer could also be B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of studying Native American autobiographies that were recorded and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe these types of autobiographies.
Thought: 
  The term "bicultural" suggests that there are two cultures involved in the creation of the autobiography.
  The term "composite authorship" suggests that the autobiography is the product of multiple authors.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" most accurately conveys the idea that the autobiography was created by both Native American and non-Native American collaborators.
  Answer choice B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product, best reflects this idea.
Criticism: 
  Answer choice A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture, is not accurate because it suggests that only one culture is involved in the creation of the autobiography.
  Answer choice C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined, is not accurate because the identities of the collaborators are known.
  Answer choice D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture, is not accurate because it suggests that only one person from each culture is involved in the creation of the autobiography.
  Answer choice E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture, is not accurate because it suggests that only one person from each culture is involved in the creation of the autobiography.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholarship on Native American autobiographies, which has focused on written autobiographies created through collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators.
  The passage uses the term "bicultural composite authorship" to describe this type of collaboration.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the collaboration between Native American and non-Native American authors in creating written autobiographies.
  The term "composite" suggests that the finished product is a combination of contributions from both cultures.
  Therefore, the answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism: 
  The answer is close, but not quite accurate. The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" does not necessarily imply that the Native American author wrote the autobiography originally and that the non-Native American collaborator only edited and revised it. It could also mean that the non-Native American collaborator solicited and recorded the Native American author's oral history and then translated and edited it into a written autobiography. Therefore, the answer is not clear-cut.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of focusing on written, as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
  The scholars who have studied these life histories have focused on "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought: 
  "Bicultural composite authorship" refers to written life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  These collaborators belong to a different culture than the Native American whose life history is being recorded.
  Therefore, the answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholars' studies of Native American autobiographies.
  Scholars have focused on "as-told-to" life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  Scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the type of life histories that scholars have focused on.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the type of life histories that scholars have focused on.
  These life histories were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The phrase suggests that the life histories are a product of collaboration between two cultures.
  The life histories are not based solely on the perspective of the Native American author.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism: 
  The answer D is correct in that the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" suggests that the life histories are a product of collaboration between two cultures.
  However, the answer is not entirely accurate in that it implies that the life histories were originally written by a member of one culture.
  The passage does not provide information about who originally wrote the life histories.
  Therefore, the answer should be revised to "written by a member of one culture but produced through collaboration with a member of another culture."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the limitations of scholars' studies of Native American autobiographies.
  The scholars have focused on written as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  The passage introduces the term "bicultural composite authorship" in line 5.
Thought: 
  The term "bicultural" suggests that there are two cultures involved in the authorship.
  The term "composite" suggests that the authorship is a combination of elements from both cultures.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to written life histories that were created collaboratively by Native Americans and non-Native Americans.
  The answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The answer is not A because there is no mention of artifacts in the context of bicultural composite authorship.
  The answer is not C because the identities of the authors are known.
  The answer is not D because there is no mention of revisions to the original text.
  The answer is not E because there is no mention of oral communication between members of different cultures.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon
  C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  D: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to introduce the main topic to be discussed
  E: to introduce the main topic to be discussed to present a view that will be argued against
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in both passages.
  Passage A uses the study to illustrate the concept of rivalry and the importance of relative income to happiness.
  Passage B uses the study to argue that people feel happier when they feel successful and have created value.
Thought: 
  Passage A uses the Solnick and Hemenway study to support the idea that people are driven by the desire to improve their relative position in society.
  Passage B uses the Solnick and Hemenway study to argue that people feel happier when they feel successful and have created value.
  The two passages use the study for different purposes.
  Passage A uses the study to support the idea that relative income is important to happiness, while Passage B uses the study to support the idea that creating value is important to happiness.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B respectively mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for different explanations of a phenomenon.
  The answer is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passages to suggest that one passage is presenting a view that will be argued against.
  Both passages are presenting different perspectives on the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  However, the explanation that each passage provides is supported by evidence, including the Solnick and Hemenway study.
  Therefore, the answer could also be interpreted as "to provide evidence for different explanations of a phenomenon."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the paradox of happiness and wealth, and how people's reference group affects their happiness.
  Passage B discusses the theory that earning more makes people happier because it makes them feel successful and that they have created value.

Thought: 
  In Passage A, the Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned to provide evidence for the importance of people's reference group in affecting their happiness.
  In Passage B, the Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned to argue against the theory that people care most about one-upmanship and to provide evidence for the theory that earning more makes people happier because it makes them feel successful and that they have created value.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B mention the Solnick and Hemenway study for different reasons.
  The best answer is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the paradox of happiness and wealth and explains that people compare their income with some norm, which is pushed up by habituation and rivalry. It also mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to show that people's relative position is crucial for happiness.
  Passage B argues against the theory that we care most about one-upmanship and suggests that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful.
Thought: 
  Passage A mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for the importance of people's relative position for happiness, while Passage B mentions the study to argue against the theory of one-upmanship and provide evidence for the idea that earning more makes people happier because it makes them feel successful.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B mention the Solnick and Hemenway study for different reasons.

  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in both passages.
Thought:
  In Passage A, the Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned to provide evidence for the importance of relative position on happiness.
  In Passage B, the Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned to argue against the theory that people are motivated by one-upmanship and to support the theory that people are motivated by a desire to create value.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon and to present a view that will be argued against.
  The answer is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence that the authors of Passage B are arguing against a view presented in Passage A.
  However, the authors of Passage B are presenting a view that contrasts with the theory mentioned in Passage A, and the Solnick and Hemenway study is used to support this view.
  Therefore, the answer is still B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses research on the relationship between wealth and happiness, and presents the paradox that while richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people, advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. It also discusses the phenomena of habituation and rivalry, which push up the norm for income and affect people's happiness.
  Passage B discusses the idea that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful and that they have created value. It argues that material wealth is used to show that people are prosperous because they create value.
Thought: 
  The study by Solnick and Hemenway is mentioned in both passages, but for different reasons. 
  In Passage A, the study is used to illustrate the phenomenon of rivalry and the importance of relative position for happiness. 
  In Passage B, the study is used to argue against the idea that people care most about one-upmanship and to provide evidence for the idea that earning more makes people feel successful and that they have created value.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon and to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided, respectively.
  The answer is C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the paradox of happiness and wealth, and how people compare their income with some norm that must be rising along with actual income. It also discusses the phenomena of habituation and rivalry in relation to happiness.
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful and have created value. It also argues that wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in both passages.
Thought: 
  In Passage A, the Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned to provide evidence for the importance of how people compare themselves to others in relation to happiness. The study shows that people are happy to be poorer if their relative position improves. This supports the idea that people compare their income with some norm and that the norm must be rising along with actual income.
  In Passage B, the Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned to argue against the idea that people care most about one-upmanship and having more than others. The study shows that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful and that they have created value. This supports the idea that people use material wealth to show that they are prosperous because they create value.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B mention the Solnick and Hemenway study for different reasons.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.
  B: It serves as the author's logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border
  B: a study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

  The subtractive method involves taking a baseline measurement in the control condition and subtracting it from a second measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task.
  The resulting image is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, but it actually depicts the differential rate of oxygen use.
Thought: 
  The author is critical of the modular theory of mind and believes that mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules.
  The author argues that the subtractive method produces an illusion of neat functional localization by subtracting out all the distributed brain functions.
  Therefore, the author would not agree that the subtractive method supports the modular theory of mind.
  The author does not discuss medical applications of the subtractive method, so option A is incorrect.
  The author does not argue that the subtractive method supports Uttal's view that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity, so option B is incorrect.
  The author does not discuss the amygdala or emotions in relation to the subtractive method, so option C is incorrect.
  The author argues that the subtractive method produces an illusion of neat functional localization, so option D is incorrect.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct that the author is critical of the modular theory of mind and argues that mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules.
  However, the author does not explicitly state that the subtractive method is based on a fundamental misconception.
  The author argues that the subtractive method produces an illusion of neat functional localization, but this is not the same as a fundamental misconception.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the defendant's challenge to the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial.
  The author of Passage A believes that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and has long been considered reliable, although further testing and development of more consistent standards may be desirable.
  The author of Passage A believes that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification and are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements.
  Passage B discusses the lack of objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and the lack of consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification.
  The author of Passage B believes that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
Thought:
  The authors would most likely disagree about:
  A: Whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable: There is no indication that the authors disagree on this point. Passage A states that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review, and Passage B does not mention training or uniformity.
  B: The likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case: Passage A states that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate, while Passage B argues that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study and cites a more rigorous test that showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification. This is a clear disagreement between the authors.
  C: Whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law: Passage A states that fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law but has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and is reliable, while Passage B does not address this issue.
  D: The relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification: Passage A states that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification, while Passage B discusses the lack of consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification and the rejection of point counting for a more holistic approach. This is a disagreement between the authors.
  E: Whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match: Passage A acknowledges that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, while Passage B does not address this issue.
  Based on the above analysis, the authors would most likely disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case. The answer is B. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the defendant's challenge to fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, but ultimately supports the reliability of fingerprint identification.
  Passage B discusses the lack of objective standards for evaluating fingerprint matches, the unknown likelihood of two individuals sharing identifying characteristics, and the lack of systematic study of the error rate for fingerprint identification.
Thought:
  Passage A supports the reliability of fingerprint identification, while Passage B highlights the lack of objective standards and unknown error rate for fingerprint identification.
  The authors may disagree about the reliability and accuracy of fingerprint identification, specifically the likelihood of a fingerprint examiner incorrectly declaring a match.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree about B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the defendant's challenge to the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, but ultimately concludes that fingerprint identification is a reliable form of evidence that has been used for 100 years.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match," and that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. It also notes that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification is a reliable form of evidence that has been used for 100 years, and that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. The author does not seem to be concerned about the lack of uniform, objective standards or the inability of fingerprint examiners to name studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints.
  Passage B argues that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. The author is concerned about the lack of objective standards and the unknown error rate for fingerprint identification.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law. Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, but is still a reliable form of evidence. Passage B does not address whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law, but raises concerns about the lack of objective standards and the unknown error rate for fingerprint identification.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the defendant's challenge to the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial and argues that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and is reliable.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. It also discusses the unknown likelihood of two individuals sharing a given number of identifying characteristics and the lack of systematic study of the error rate for fingerprint identification.
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B have different perspectives on the reliability of fingerprint identification and the standards used by fingerprint examiners.
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification is reliable and has withstood the test of time, and that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification with uniform standards established through professional training and peer review.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. It also discusses the unknown likelihood of two individuals sharing a given number of identifying characteristics and the lack of systematic study of the error rate for fingerprint identification.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about whether fingerprint identification is reliable and whether fingerprint examiners have objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match."
  The answer is C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law.
Criticism:
  The answer is incorrect because neither passage discusses whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A defends the reliability of fingerprint evidence and argues that it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and experts have long concurred about its reliability.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. It also argues that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification is reliable and has been used for 100 years, and that there are uniform standards for testing and proficiency requirements for fingerprint examiners. 
  Passage B argues that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. It also argues that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification and whether there are objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match."
  The answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Criticism: 
  The answer is incorrect. 
  While the authors do disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification, they do not specifically mention the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
  However, they do mention the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice, which is related to the likelihood of incorrect identifications.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues in favor of the reliability of fingerprint identification as evidence in criminal trials, citing the long history of its use and the establishment of uniform standards for examiners through professional training and peer review. It also suggests that while further testing and the development of more consistent standards may be desirable, there is no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has been used for so long.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match," and that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. It suggests that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
Thought: 
  The authors of the two passages seem to have fundamentally different views on the reliability of fingerprint identification as evidence in criminal trials. While Passage A argues in favor of its reliability and suggests that uniform standards have been established for examiners, Passage B argues that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. 
  The authors do not seem to disagree about whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable, as both passages suggest that uniform standards have been established for examiners through professional training and peer review. 
  The authors also do not seem to disagree about the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification, as Passage B merely suggests that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. 
  While the authors of the two passages may have different views on whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law, this issue is not explicitly addressed in either passage. 
  The authors do seem to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case, as Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate, while Passage B suggests that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study and cites a more rigorous test that showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification. 
  The authors also seem to disagree about whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match, as Passage A suggests that while different agencies may require different degrees of correlation, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification, while Passage B suggests that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match.
Criticism: 
  The analysis seems correct. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and experts have long concurred about its reliability. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, the court sees no reason to reject it outright. Fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The fingerprint expert testified that examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. A more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues in favor of fingerprint identification and suggests that it has an exceedingly low error rate. The author sees no reason to reject it outright. Uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. 
  Passage B argues against fingerprint identification, suggesting that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. A more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification. Passage A argues that fingerprint identification is reliable, while Passage B argues against it, suggesting that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and that experts have long concurred about its reliability. It also argues that while further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, there is no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. Passage A also states that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. It also argues that the trial court below was within its discretion in crediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. 
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." It states that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. It also argues that the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case is unknown, but that a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification. 
Thought: 
  Passage A argues for the reliability of fingerprint identification and suggests that it has been used successfully for a long time. It also argues that there are established standards for fingerprint examiners and that the error rate is exceedingly low. 
  Passage B argues that there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining when to declare a match, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. It also suggests that a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification. 
  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification and the error rate for fingerprint identification.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The best works of art improve with age.
  E: Some forms of art are superior to others.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfumery as art forms.
  The author argues that perfumes are undervalued despite the artistic skill involved in creating them.
Thought: 
  The passage does not provide support for statements A, C, D, or E.
  The passage does support statement B, as the author discusses how perfumers experiment with olfactory elements to produce combinations of small sensations, much like painters combine pigments to create harmonious combinations of colors.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not make a definitive statement about all works of art, but rather focuses on the parallels between painting and perfumery.
  It is possible that other works of art may not involve the combination of small sensations in the same way that painting and perfumery do.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the parallels between the art of painting and the art of perfume-making.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that both painters and perfumers use a combination of natural and synthetic elements to create their works.
  The appearance of a painting changes over time due to the transparency of oil paint, while the scent of a perfume changes over time as its constituents evaporate at different rates.
  Both painting and perfume-making can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories they evoke.
  The passage does not suggest that one form of art is superior to another, nor does it suggest that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume-making.
  Painters combine pigments with oils and resins to create works of art.
  Perfumers combine olfactory elements to create fragrances.
  The appearance of oil paintings changes over time as the paint becomes more transparent.
  Fragrances change over time as their constituents evaporate at different rates.
Thought:
  The passage compares the process of creating paintings to the process of creating fragrances.
  Both involve combining different elements to create a unified whole.
  Both change over time as their constituents interact with each other and with the environment.
  The passage also suggests that fragrances are undervalued because they are often produced for commercial reasons rather than artistic ones.
  Therefore, the passage supports the idea that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes (choice A).
Criticism:
  The passage does not directly address the idea that one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations in any work of art (choice B).
  The passage does not suggest that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success (choice C).
  The passage does not suggest that the best works of art improve with age (choice D).
  The passage does not suggest that some forms of art are superior to others (choice E).
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume-making.
  Painters use natural and synthetic pigments to create works of art, while perfumers use natural and synthetic chemical compounds to create fragrances.
  Both painters and perfumers carefully combine these elements to create a final product that evokes an aesthetic experience.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that perfumers are in the same business as artists who create the illusion of life on canvas, and that both painters and perfumers use combinations of elements to create an aesthetic experience. 
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for statement A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide support for statement B, C, D, or E.
  Statement B is similar to the idea presented in the passage, but it is not explicitly supported. 
  Statement C is not discussed in the passage, and the passage does not suggest that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success. 
  Statement D is not supported by the passage, and the passage only discusses how the appearance of oil paintings changes over time. 
  Statement E is not supported by the passage, and the passage does not suggest that some forms of art are superior to others.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings

Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the strategy of "stealing thunder" in the courtroom, which involves revealing negative information about a client before it is revealed by opposing counsel. The passage suggests that this strategy can be effective in certain situations.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests several factors that could contribute to the success of stealing thunder. One factor is that revealing damaging information early can create an image of credibility, as people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and persuasive. Another factor is that stealing thunder can provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance.
  None of the options mentioned in the question mention any of these factors.
Criticism: 
  None of the options mentioned in the question correspond to the factors mentioned in the passage.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.
  D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he condueted.
  E: Though he composed and condueted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use
  D: detectable using brain scans enhanced by means of the subtractive method

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?

  Mental disorder is discussed in Passage B as an example of a constrained action.
  Free choice is discussed in both passages.
  Causality is discussed in both passages.
  Self-delusion is discussed in Passage A.
  Moral responsibility is discussed in Passage A.
  Therefore, the concept that plays a role in the argument of Passage B but not in that of Passage A is A: mental disorder.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that behavior is caused by the operations of the brain and that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that people may be deluding themselves into thinking they are making free and rational moral choices.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues against the idea of free and rational moral choice, while passage B argues that actions can still be free even in a deterministic world.
  Passage B talks about the distinction between free actions and constrained actions, while passage A does not.
  Therefore, the concept of free choice plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A.
  The answer is B: free choice.
Criticism: 
  The concept of moral responsibility is also discussed in passage A, as it argues against the idea of retribution as a justification for punishment.
  However, the passage does not explicitly discuss the distinction between free actions and constrained actions, which is the main focus of passage B.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Response 0:
Knowledge: The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the evidence that led to its discovery. 
Thought: The relevant evidence referred to in the passage is the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission. 
A: This choice is too broad, as it refers to all experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, rather than the specific evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission. 
B: This choice is too specific, as it refers only to the experiments conducted by Meitner in 1938, rather than all of the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission. 
C: This choice refers to the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, which is a crucial piece of evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission. 
D: This choice refers to the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus, which is another crucial piece of evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, which was achieved through experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection between the experimental evidence and the underlying theoretical considerations.
  Otto Hahn identified barium as one of the products resulting from neutron bombardment of uranium, which was unexpected and went against previous experiences of nuclear physics.
Thought: 
  The author refers to "the relevant evidence" as something that had been present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The evidence must be related to the discovery of nuclear fission and the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The evidence must be something that was not recognized or understood until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  The evidence must be something that was present before the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Based on these criteria, the most likely answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism: 
  The evidence referred to by the author could also include the unexpected identification of barium by Otto Hahn, which was a crucial piece of evidence that led to the recognition of nuclear fission.
  However, this evidence was not present for some time before it was identified by Hahn, so it does not fit the author's description of "the relevant evidence."

  The answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence to suggest that "the relevant evidence" refers to the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 (choice A).
  The author mentions Meitner's related research in Sweden, but there is no evidence to suggest that "the relevant evidence" refers to the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938 (choice B).
  While the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus (choice D) is mentioned, it is not the "relevant evidence" that the author is referring to.
  The fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long (choice E) is mentioned, but it is not the "relevant evidence" that the author is referring to.

  Therefore, the relevant evidence is related to Meitner's work.
  The answer is B: the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938.
Criticism: 
  The passage mentions that scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939.
  The relevant evidence could be interpreted as the results of all experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted during that time, not just Meitner's.

  The "relevant evidence" referred to in the passage is the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The passage mentions that the evidence had been present for some time, but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission includes the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium, the clear chemical evidence of barium being produced, and the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus.
  Of these options, the clearest evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission is the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Therefore, the answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, as this is part of a functioning stock market.
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should only prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should permit selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the stock market, which is necessary for individual merit and skill to be the basis of success.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence, which could ultimately destroy the market.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, as this is part of a functioning stock market.
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should only prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Option A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which is contrary to the position articulated by the author of Passage A.
  Option B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is consistent with the position articulated by the author of Passage A.
  Option C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is not the main concern of the author of Passage A.
  Option D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not consistent with the position articulated by the author of Passage A.
  Option E legalizes trading based on inside information, which is not consistent with the position articulated by the author of Passage A.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant criticism of this answer, as it is consistent with the position articulated by the author of Passage A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have, but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading law should prohibit trading based on information that other people don't have, because that unfairly compromises the market.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that the stock market works best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Therefore, trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have is not necessarily insider trading. It is only insider trading if the information is obtained from one's position within a company. 
  Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism: 
  None
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should permit trading based on information that is gained from analysis of a stock but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading laws should prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone to maintain a transparent market.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should permit trading based on information that is gained from analysis of a stock but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company because it helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts and is good for everyone in the stock market. 
  The other choices do not conform closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, as long as it is obtained through analysis of a stock, and that selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines the transparency of the stock market and unfairly compromises the market, causing a loss of investor confidence and ultimately destroying the market.
Thought:
  The author of Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, as long as it is obtained through analysis of a stock, and that selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. Therefore, the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism:
  The author of Passage A does not argue for the legalization of insider-trading. Rather, the author argues that insider-trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, as long as it is obtained through analysis of a stock, and that selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that is available to everyone, but rather only trading based on information that is not shared by everyone. 
  Passage B argues that insider-trading should be illegal because it unfairly compromises the stock market and undermines investor confidence.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that the stock market works best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible, and insider trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that is available to everyone. 
  Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B is a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
  This law would allow for the spread of information and evaluations of a company's value, but would prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, as it would give some traders an unfair advantage over others.
  The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should not prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone because it is part of a functioning stock market. It argues that insider-trading laws should only prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading laws should prohibit trading based on any inside information because it unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence, which could ultimately destroy the market.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should only prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
  Choice A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which is broader than what Passage A argues for.
  Choice B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is exactly what Passage A argues for.
  Choice C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is broader than what Passage A argues for.
  Choice D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not related to what Passage A argues for.
  Choice E legalizes trading based on inside information, which is broader than what Passage A argues for.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Criticism: 
  There is no criticism of the thought process. The answer is correct based on the information provided in the passages. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws can be problematic because they prevent accurate information from being reflected in stock prices and can discourage people from investing in the stock market.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines investor confidence and can ultimately destroy the stock market.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws can be too restrictive and can prevent accurate information from being reflected in stock prices. The author suggests that it is important to distinguish between trading based on inside information gained from one's position within a company and trading based on other types of information. The author suggests that it is acceptable to trade based on information gained from analysis of a stock, even if others don't have that information. Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
  The other options do not accurately reflect the position articulated by the author of passage A. Option A suggests that all trading must be based on information that is shared by everyone, which is too restrictive and would prevent people from making informed investment decisions. Option C suggests that all trading that could undermine investor confidence should be prohibited, which is too vague and could be interpreted in many different ways. Option D suggests that selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping should be legalized, but buying based on inside information that it should be rising should be prohibited, which is arbitrary and does not reflect the author's argument. Option E suggests that insider trading should be legalized as long as the information is not obtained by unlawful means, which is too permissive and would not address the concerns raised by the author of passage A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law can prevent the spread of accurate information and compromise the market.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines investor confidence and denies companies access to funds.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have is part of the functioning of the stock market.
  However, insider trading can compromise the market by preventing the spread of accurate information.
  Therefore, the law should prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, but permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock.
  The law should not legalize trading based on inside information.
  The answer is A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
Criticism:
  The author of Passage A argues that insider trading can help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. 
  However, the author also acknowledges that insider trading can prevent the spread of accurate information and compromise the market.
  Therefore, the answer could also be C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  Passage A argues that when someone sells a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value, it helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping.
  Passage B argues that insider trading unfairly compromises the market because people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence, which could ultimately destroy the market.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
  Option A argues that trading based on information that is not shared by everyone should be prohibited.
  Option B argues that trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock should be permitted but trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company should be prohibited.
  Option C argues that trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market should be prohibited.
  Option D argues that selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping should be legalized but buying based on inside information that it should be rising should be prohibited.
  Option E argues that trading based on inside information should be legalized, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means.
  Option A, C, D, and E do not conform to the position articulated by the author of passage A.
  Option B is consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage A because it permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock, which is similar to the example given in passage A of someone selling a stock because they analyzed it and found it to be overvalued.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Passage B argues that insider trading laws should prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone to maintain a transparent market, which is fair to all participants.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws should permit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
  Option A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which goes against the position of Passage A.
  Option B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock, which aligns with the position of Passage A, but it does not address the issue of trading based on inside information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Option C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is not directly related to the position of Passage A.
  Option D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not directly related to the position of Passage A.
  Option E legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means, which goes against the position of Passage B but is not directly related to the position of Passage A.
  Option B is the closest to the position articulated by the author of Passage A.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the two theories of how neurons communicate: electrically and chemically.
  The alternative theory, which has gained acceptance, is that neurotransmitters are chemicals that bind to receptors on the receiving neuron, rendering it permeable to ions and generating an electrical impulse.
  The structure of neurotransmitter receptors includes a binding site for the neurotransmitter and a channel for ions.
  Receptors for different neurotransmitters have been isolated and classified as a family of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
  Each receptor in this family has several varieties with slightly different properties.
  The discovery of these receptor differences raises the possibility of selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is about the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels and their potential for selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The passage discusses the two theories of how neurons communicate, but the main focus is on the chemical theory and the structure of neurotransmitter receptors.
  The discussion of receptor varieties and their potential for selective treatment is a significant part of the passage.
  The correct answer should include information about neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, receptor varieties, and potential for selective treatment.
  A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not mention the potential for selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E is incorrect because it does not mention neurotransmitter-gated ion channels or the classification of receptors as a family.
  D accurately includes the main points of the passage: the chemical theory of neuron communication, the structure of neurotransmitter receptors, receptor varieties, and the potential for selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Criticism: 
  The answer accurately includes the main points of the passage and is well-supported by the information provided.
Action: Answer("D")

  The passage discusses two theories of how neurons communicate: one involving electrical signals and the other involving chemical neurotransmitters.
  The chemical neurotransmitter theory involves the secretion of neurotransmitters by an excited neuron, which bind with corresponding receptor molecules in the receiving neuron, rendering it permeable to ions and generating an electrical impulse that runs through the cell.
  The structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  Receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.

  E: This statement is partially correct, but it does not fully capture the main point of the passage. It is true that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain. However, it does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which is that the workings of the brain are guided by chemical neurotransmitters and the structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
Criticism: 
  The main point of the passage is about the workings of the brain being guided by chemical neurotransmitters and the structure of receptors playing a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory since Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand emphasizes diminishing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly and hinder the proper functioning of the Invisible Hand.
  Economists historically struggled to model the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor.
Thought:
  The main point of the passage is that the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand represent contradictory concepts in economic theory, and the assumption of diminishing returns to scale has dominated economic thought because it can be more easily represented mathematically. However, recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled with greater rigor, leading to a greater appreciation of the role of increasing returns to scale in economic thought.
  Therefore, the most accurate choice is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 
Criticism:
  While the passage does mention that recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously, it does not suggest that the Pin Factory can be modeled more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by increased labor demand in the North, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and the cutoff of immigration during World War I.
  Once started, migration developed momentum over time, in part because earlier migrants reduced the physical costs of moving and provided a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

  D is not a good analogy because both friction and pneumatic components are necessary for the braking system of a train.
  E is not a good analogy because the word processing program is necessary for the computer to function as a word processor, rather than providing additional features or benefits.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism: 
  The analogy in B is not perfect because primary substances are necessary for all plants, while mechanical components are not necessary for all automobiles (e.g. electric cars).
  However, B is still the best analogy among the given choices.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.

  Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the prevailing methodology at the time, as she participated in the dances herself.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Therefore, the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have likely agreed with the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  This view is closest to statement B: "Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of the technique of dance-isolation into North American and European choreography.
  Dunham was a pioneer in the field of dance ethnology, conducting research into traditional Caribbean dance forms and their origins in African culture.
  Dunham's success in bringing traditional dance techniques into the mainstream of modern North American dance was due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
Thought:
  The passage discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research in the past, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry.
  The passage suggests that Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  The passage implies that the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been unlikely to agree with Dunham's approach to research, which involved participating in the dances herself.
  The passage does not suggest that the peers mentioned in line 22 would have agreed with any of the statements in the answer choices.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of dance-isolation and her success in bringing traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into North American and European choreography.
  Dunham was an anthropologist who conducted research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms with special interest in their origins in African culture.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time, which advised complete detachment.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing because of the prevailing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Therefore, Dunham's peers were likely to agree with the statement that social scientists need to be completely detached from the cultural practices they are studying in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  The answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not suggest that Dunham's peers believed that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  Rather, the passage suggests that Dunham's peers believed that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Therefore, the correct answer is not B.

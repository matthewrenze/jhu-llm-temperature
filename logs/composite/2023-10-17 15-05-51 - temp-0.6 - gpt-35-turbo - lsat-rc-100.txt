### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses research on the relationship between wealth and happiness and how people compare their income with some norm.
  Passage B discusses theories on why earning more makes people happier and how material wealth is used to show that one is prosperous because they create value.
Thought: 
  The authors of both passages view the desire to make more money than one's neighbors as evidence of a desire to create value and benefit society.
  Therefore, they are unlikely to use negative terms like "misguided" or "primitive" to describe such a person.
  They are also unlikely to use positive terms like "altruistic" or "admirable" since the desire to make more money is not necessarily motivated by a desire to help others.
  The authors may use terms like "competitive" or "driven" to describe such a person.
  None of the answer choices match these descriptions.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: The information in the passage most helps to answer a which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: What laboratory experiments were conducted by Molina or Rowland in their research on CFCs?
  B: What was the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1 987?
  C: In what year did Molina testify before the U.S. Congress?

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

  D: The two documents both discuss cameras in the courtroom, but one discusses the troublesome history of cameras while the other discusses the laudable motives behind televised proceedings. This does not reflect the relationship between Passage A and Passage B.
  E: The two documents both discuss cameras in the courtroom, but one argues for a ban while the other argues that it is inevitable. This does not reflect the relationship between Passage A and Passage B.
Criticism: 
  While it is true that both documents discuss a legal topic and approach it from different angles, the specific topics and arguments presented in each document are different from those in Passage A and Passage B. 
  Therefore, there may not be a pair of documents in the choices that is truly analogous to the relationship between Passage A and Passage B.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the concept of jury nullification, its potential problems, and concerns about its use.
  Passage B discusses how the jury can act as a safety valve and assist the legislature by nullifying in certain circumstances.
Thoughts:
  Passage A and Passage B have a complementary relationship.
  Passage A discusses the concept of jury nullification and its potential problems.
  Passage B provides a counterpoint by discussing how the jury can act as a safety valve and assist the legislature by nullifying in certain circumstances.
  The two passages together provide a nuanced discussion of the role of jury nullification in the legal system.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two passages is most analogous to choice B.
Criticism:
  There is no criticism to this answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the concept of jury nullification and the potential problems it poses.
  Passage B discusses the role of the jury in using discretion to nullify a law, and how this can be beneficial in assisting the legislature.
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss the role of the jury in the legal system, but from different perspectives. 
  Passage A focuses on the problems that can arise from jury nullification, while Passage B discusses the potential benefits of nullification in certain circumstances. 
  Therefore, the relationship between Passage A and Passage B is one of contrast or opposition.
  The answer is not A, B, C, or D as they do not describe a contrasting relationship between the two passages.
  It is possible that E could be the answer, as it also discusses cameras in the courtroom, but it is not clear from the titles alone whether the relationship between the two documents is one of contrast or comparison.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is E, "Why Cameras Should Be Banned from the Courtroom" and "The Inevitability of Televised Courtroom Proceedings", although it is not a perfect match. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the concept of jury nullification and the problems it can create.
  Passage B discusses the potential benefits of jury nullification, including its ability to act as a safety valve and assist the legislature.

  Similarly, the documents in the answer choices likely both discuss cameras in the courtroom, but from different perspectives.
  Based on the titles, it seems that the documents in each pair will be discussing the pros and cons or potential benefits and drawbacks of cameras in the courtroom.
  Therefore, the pair of documents that is most analogous to the relationship between Passage A and Passage B is B: Cameras in the Courtroom: Three Central Issues in the Debate "The Unexpected Benefits of Permitting Cameras in Court".
Criticism: 
  It is possible that the documents in pair B do not actually argue for the benefits of allowing cameras in the courtroom, but instead simply discuss the issue and its potential impacts. Without further information, it is difficult to know whether this criticism is valid.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses jury nullification and its problems.
  Passage B discusses how the jury can act as a safety valve and assist the legislature.
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss the role of the jury in the criminal justice system, but they have different focuses. 
  Passage A is concerned with the problems created by jury nullification, while Passage B argues that nullification can be useful in certain circumstances.

Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the problems with jury nullification, including the unknown frequency of its use and the potential for jurors to lack sufficient evidence or understanding of the law to make a proper decision.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can serve as a safety valve in cases where police or prosecutors are overzealous, or in cases where a law is unjust or does not apply to a particular defendant. It suggests that nullification can also serve as a signal to the legislature that a law may need revision.
Thought:
  The question asks for the pair of documents that has a relationship most analogous to the relationship between Passage A and Passage B.
  Based on the summaries of the pairs of documents, it seems that only Pair B could potentially have a similar relationship.
  Pair B includes one document arguing for the benefits of cameras in the courtroom, while the other document discusses the central issues in the debate. This is similar to Passage B arguing for the benefits of jury nullification and the role it can play in the legal system, while Passage A discusses the potential problems with it.
  The other pairs of documents do not seem to have a similar relationship.

  Passage A discusses jury nullification, its problems, and why juries are not the proper place to disagree on the proper reach of criminal laws.
  Passage B discusses how juries can act as a safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous, and how they can assist the legislature by nullifying laws they believe are unjust or inapplicable.
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B are two documents that are related to each other.
  Passage A discusses the problems with jury nullification and why juries are not the proper place to disagree on the proper reach of criminal laws.
  Passage B discusses how juries can act as a safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous and how they can assist the legislature by nullifying laws they believe are unjust or inapplicable.
  Both passages are discussing the role of juries in the legal system, but they are discussing different aspects of that role.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two passages is most analogous to the relationship between documents in which one of the following pairs:
  B: Cameras in the Courtroom: Three Central Issues in the Debate "The Unexpected Benefits of Permitting Cameras in Court"
  Both documents in this pair are discussing the issue of cameras in the courtroom, but they are discussing different aspects of that issue. One document is discussing the pros and cons of televising courtroom proceedings, while the other document is discussing the unexpected benefits of permitting cameras in court. Similarly, Passage A and Passage B are both discussing the role of juries in the legal system, but they are discussing different aspects of that role.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the problems with jury nullification and why it is not an ideal solution.
  Passage B discusses how jury nullification can sometimes be a useful tool in the legal system.
Thought:
  Passage A and B have opposing views on the usefulness of jury nullification.
  The answer choice that is most analogous to this relationship would be a pair of documents that have opposing views on a particular issue.
  Answer choices A, C, D, and E all have titles that suggest they are focused on a single viewpoint or issue, so they are unlikely to be the correct answer.
  Answer choice B has titles that suggest there are pros and cons to permitting cameras in the courtroom, which implies that the document will have a balanced discussion of the issue.
  This is similar to the relationship between Passage A and B, where one passage discusses the problems with jury nullification and the other discusses its potential benefits.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Cameras in the Courtroom: Three Central Issues in the Debate "The Unexpected Benefits of Permitting Cameras in Court".

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and the role of secondary substances in giving plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances can arise from genetic mutations and can be favored by natural selection for their role in attracting pollinating insects or as biochemical defenses against plant enemies.
Thought:
  The passage suggests that secondary substances that are toxic to insects have evolved as biochemical defenses against plant enemies.
  The passage also suggests that insects have evolved ways to circumvent plant defenses, such as by detoxifying harmful substances or avoiding their effects.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  The answer is B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and their secondary substances, which give them distinctive tastes and smells.
  Insects play a major role in the evolution of secondary substances in plants, both as biochemical defenses and as attractants for pollinators.
Thought:
  The passage provides support for the idea that secondary substances in plants play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants, as they are involved in both defense and attraction of insects.
  The passage also suggests that there is evolutionary competition between plants and insects, with insects evolving ways to circumvent plant defenses and identify suitable food sources.
  There is no evidence in the passage to support the idea that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell, so choice C is unlikely.
  The passage does not suggest that toxic substances have evolved independently in unrelated species of plants, so choice D is also unlikely.
  The passage does not mention the correlation between toxic and secondary substances, so choice E is also unlikely.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Plants have two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
- Primary substances are found in all plants and are required for growth and proper functioning.
- Secondary substances are diverse and have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
- Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the two categories of chemical substances found in plants: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances arise from genetic mutations and are conserved by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects or biochemical defenses against plant enemies.
  Insects have played a major role in the evolution of secondary substances in plants.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the roles of primary and secondary substances in plants and how secondary substances have evolved to attract pollinating insects or defend against plant enemies. 
  Therefore, it can be inferred that some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants. 
  The passage also discusses how insects have evolved ways of circumventing plant defenses, so it can be inferred that most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses. 
  The passage does not provide support for the inference that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell. 
  The passage does not discuss the evolution of toxic substances in unrelated species of plants, so it does not provide support for the inference that many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species. 
  The passage does not provide support for the inference that some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and can act as biochemical defenses against insects.
  Insects have played a major role in the evolution of secondary substances in plants.
Thought:
  The passage provides the most support for inferring that secondary substances in plants:
  A: Have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, but play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Are used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing chemical defense systems.
  C: Cannot be identified by most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants.
  D: Often evolve independently in various unrelated species of plants but survive in only a few species.
  E: Correlate with toxic substances produced by plants, but are not themselves secondary substances.
  Choice A is incorrect because the passage states that secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, but it does not support the idea that they play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  Choice B is incorrect because the passage states that some secondary substances act as biochemical defenses against insects, and while some insects can circumvent these defenses, it does not support the idea that most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects.
  Choice C is incorrect because the passage states that most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both.
  Choice D is incorrect because the passage states that new secondary substances continue to appear as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants and that the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family.
  Choice E is incorrect because the passage does not support the idea that toxic substances produced by plants correlate with secondary substances.
  The correct answer is A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants. The passage states that secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, but they do play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants by acting as biochemical defenses against insects or attracting pollinating insects to blossoms.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which means that as a business or factory gets larger, it becomes more efficient and productive. 
  A: This scenario does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale because the productivity of editors is not related to the size of the publishing house.
  B: This scenario does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale because it involves the division of labor among bees, not the increase in efficiency of a larger colony.
  C: This scenario does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale because it does not involve increased efficiency or productivity resulting from increased size.
  D: This scenario illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale because the lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps due to advances in technology, which leads to increased efficiency and productivity as the industry gets larger.
  E: This scenario does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale because it involves the division of a single colony into multiple competing colonies, not the increase in efficiency or productivity resulting from increased size.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an example that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale. 
  Option D describes the lobster industry being able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps due to advances in technology, which is an example of increased efficiency and productivity resulting from increased size.
  Therefore, D is the best answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes increasing returns to scale as a concept that describes how the bigger a firm is, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more output the firm can produce per worker. The passage also states that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large firm can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
Thought: 
  Option A describes a reduction in the number of editors, which would likely result in a decrease in productivity. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option B describes a bee colony that is able to use some bees solely for guarding nectar sources, which enables the colony to collect more nectar and feed a larger colony. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale in a firm.
  Option C describes a school district that is able to increase the total number of students accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale in a firm.
  Option D describes the lobster industry as a whole being able to catch more lobsters per day with the same number of traps due to advances in technology. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale in a firm.
  Option E describes a large ant colony dividing into two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. This example is not directly related to a firm, but it does illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale because the total number of ants increases as the colony grows and divides.
Criticism: 
  Option E is not directly related to a firm, which might make it less relevant to the question being asked. However, it does illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The second paragraph of the passage discusses the concept of increasing returns to scale, which occurs when the bigger the business, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more the business can produce per worker.
  A: The example provided does not involve increasing returns to scale. Instead, it describes how a publishing house is able to employ fewer editors by relaxing standards.
  B: The example provided does not involve increasing returns to scale. Instead, it describes how a large bee colony can divide up the work of processing nectar to collect more nectar.
  C: The example provided does not involve increasing returns to scale. Instead, it describes how a school district can accommodate more students by switching to year-round operation.
  D: The example provided involves increasing returns to scale as advances in technology make it possible for the lobster industry to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps.
  E: The example provided does not involve increasing returns to scale. Instead, it describes how a large ant colony can divide and produce two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies.
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale occur when the bigger the business, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more the business can produce per worker.
  The example of the lobster industry describes how advances in technology make it possible for the industry to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps.
  Therefore, the example of the lobster industry best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage.
  The answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis and answer are correct. 
  The example of the lobster industry illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale because advances in technology make it possible for the industry to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps. 
  This is a result of the bigger the business, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more the business can produce per worker.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale mean that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more output the factory can produce per worker.
  There is a natural tendency toward monopoly with increasing returns because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
Thought: 
  Answer choice A describes a reduction in the number of editors, which is the opposite of increasing returns to scale.
  Answer choice B describes a bee colony using some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, which allows the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar. This is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Answer choice C describes a school district switching to year-round operation, which is a way of accommodating more students in a single building. This is not necessarily an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Answer choice D describes advances in technology that make the doors to lobster traps easier for lobsters to get through, which leads to a higher catch rate. This is not necessarily an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Answer choice E describes a large ant colony dividing and producing two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. This is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Thus, answer choices B and E both describe increasing returns to scale, but only answer choice B involves a factory or business, which is more directly relevant to the passage.
Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the logic or reasoning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which means that as a firm's output increases, the cost per unit of output decreases.
  A: This choice describes a decrease in productivity, not an increase.
  B: This choice describes an increase in efficiency but not necessarily an increase in returns to scale.
  C: This choice describes an increase in efficiency but not necessarily an increase in returns to scale.
  D: This choice describes an increase in returns to scale, as the same number of traps are able to catch more lobsters.
  E: This choice describes an increase in returns to scale, as the ant colonies are able to produce more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that as a firm's output increases, the cost per unit of output decreases.
  A, B, and C do not necessarily describe an increase in returns to scale.
  D describes an increase in returns to scale, as the same number of traps are able to catch more lobsters.
  E also describes an increase in returns to scale, as the ant colonies are able to produce more ants than could have existed in one colony.
  Therefore, D and E are the best options, but E is a little bit more abstract.
  So, the answer is E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as the phenomenon where the bigger the company, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more output it can produce per worker. 
  A: The example does not describe an increase in output due to greater specialization as the company reduces the number of editors it employs.
  B: The example does not involve a company increasing output due to greater specialization by its workers.
  C: The example does not involve an increase in output due to greater specialization as the school accommodates more students.
  D: The example involves an increase in output due to advances in technology, but it does not involve increased specialization as the size of the lobster industry grows.
  E: The example describes how a single colony of ants that grows big enough to divide into two colonies will eventually contain more ants than it would have if it had not divided. 
Thought: 
  The question asks for an example that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  The definition of increasing returns to scale is when the bigger the company, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more output it can produce per worker.
  Example E describes how a colony of ants that grows big enough to divide into two colonies will eventually contain more ants than it would have if it had not divided. The increased size of the colony allows for greater specialization of workers, leading to greater output per worker, which is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, E is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale, which means that as a company grows, its output per worker increases.
  A: The example of a publishing house relaxing standards is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: The example of a bee colony is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  C: The example of a school district switching to year-round operation is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  D: The example of the lobster industry catching more lobsters with the same number of traps due to advances in technology is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  E: The example of an ant colony dividing and producing more colonies is not related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Thought: 
  The concept of increasing returns to scale means that as a company grows, its output per worker increases.
  The example of the lobster industry being able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps due to advances in technology illustrates this concept.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Criticism: 
  The example of the lobster industry is a good illustration of increasing returns to scale. 
  However, the passage does not explicitly state that the lobster industry is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  So, while D may be the best answer, it is not a perfect answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale is when the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore, the more output the factory can produce per worker.
  The example of the pin factory shows the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Thought: 
  A publishing house requires editors to adhere to strict standards, and this allows the publishing house to employ fewer editors. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  A bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, which enables the colony to collect more nectar. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies, together containing more ants than could have existed in one colony. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  None of the options provide an example of increasing returns to scale.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that none of the options provide an example of increasing returns to scale.
  However, it is important to note that the lobster industry example actually illustrates the concept of technological progress, which is different from increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns to scale is the idea that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more it can produce per worker.
Thought: 
  A: This answer describes relaxing standards to employ fewer editors. This does not relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  B: This answer describes using some bees to guard nectar sources to collect more nectar. This is an example of increasing returns to scale because it allows for a larger colony to better divide up work and produce more overall.
  C: This answer describes accommodating more students by switching to year-round operation. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale, but rather an example of increasing efficiency.
  D: This answer describes catching more lobsters with the same number of traps due to technological advances. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale, but rather an example of increasing efficiency.
  E: This answer describes dividing a large ant colony into two competing colonies that eventually grow and divide further. This is not an example of increasing returns to scale, but rather an example of growth through division.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar. 
Criticism: 
  None. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  The pin factory example shows how increasing returns to scale can lead to greater efficiency and productivity.
Thought: 
  Option A describes a decrease in productivity, not an increase, so it does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option B describes a natural division of labor within a bee colony, but it does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option C describes a way to accommodate more students in a single building, but it does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option D describes an increase in productivity due to advances in technology, but it does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option E describes how a large ant colony can divide into multiple successful colonies, each of which is more productive than the original colony. This illustrates increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Criticism: 
  There is no significant flaw in the logic or reasoning used to arrive at the answer.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.

  The passage discusses the development of writing, including the use of abstract symbols in early writing systems.
  The sign for "sheep" is an abstract symbol, not a pictograph.
Thought: 
  The author of the passage is most likely to agree that the sign for "sheep" is an abstract symbol, and therefore its meaning is not directly related to the image of a sheep.
  This is supported by the statement in the passage that "though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used."
  The author does not suggest that the sign for "sheep" gets its meaning in a radically different way from the sign for "metal" (B), or that the way in which it represents its meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity (C).
  The author also does not suggest that the sign for "sheep" was not the subject of scientific scrutiny prior to Schmandt-Besserat's work (D), or that the abstract nature of the sign reveals anything about the political life of the people who used the language (E).
  Therefore, the best answer is A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of abstract symbols in the early form of writing found in the Sumerian city of Uruk.
  The sign for "sheep" is a circled cross and the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines.
Thought: 
  The author of the passage would most likely agree that:
  A: The sign could not have been replaced without loss of significance because it was already an established symbol for "sheep".
  B: The two signs get their meaning in a similar way, as established and accepted symbols within the writing system.
  C: The passage does not provide evidence to support this statement.
  D: The passage suggests that the tokens and their inscriptions were overlooked by earlier archaeologists, but Denise Schmandt-Besserat recognized them as predecessors to the written word.
  E: The passage does not provide evidence to support this statement.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The way in which it represents its meaning was not the subject of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:

  The tablets date from around 3000 B.C. and use relatively few pictographs but instead use numerous abstract symbols.
  The sign for "sheep" is a circled cross, and the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines.
Thought: 
  The author of the passage is most likely to agree that the sign for "sheep" gets its meaning in a different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  This is because the passage describes how the tablets use numerous abstract symbols, and the sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep but rather a circled cross.
  Therefore, the author is likely to agree that the abstract nature of the sign for "sheep" is distinct from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  The answer is B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to
Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work
  B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work
  C: acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works
  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works
  E: explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is

  The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," and that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  Dostoyevsky believed that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms.
  Therefore, if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view would be most softened.
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Dostoyevsky took a position that was different from the two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism during his time.
  One radical view maintained that literature should be useful and find its sources in concrete reality.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
  Dostoyevsky defined artistic as the ability to write well and express thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts.
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics' view that literature should be useful.
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky's attitude would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  The other options are not likely to soften Dostoyevsky's attitude towards the radical critics' view.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses different attitudes toward literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  Dostoyevsky took a position that reality was the crucial source of literature, but his understanding of reality was deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it, and that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  Dostoyevsky believed that literature must stand or fall on its artistic merit and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.

  Dostoyevsky believed that literary works must stand or fall on their artistic merit, and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
  If the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit, they would be able to appreciate literary works that may not necessarily serve a particular political view or contribute to the creation of a new society.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if they recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky's position on the radical critics' view is that it is unsatisfactory and assigning to art a "shameful destiny."
  It can be inferred that if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view would be most softened.
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.

Criticism: 
  The answer is correct. 
  If the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, they would not insist that a literary work must serve a particular political view or be useful to people and society.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.
  B: Katherine Dunham's ballets were distinct from others produced in North America in that they incorporated authentic dance techniques from traditional cultures.
  C: Katherine Dunham's expertise as an anthropologist allowed her to use Caribbean and African dance traditions to express the aesthetic and political concerns of African American dancers and choreographers.
  D: The innovative research methods of Katherine Dunham made possible her discovery that the dance traditions of the Caribbean were derived from earlier African dance traditions.
  E: Katherine Dunham's anthropological and choreographic expertise enabled her to make contributions that altered the landscape of modern dance in North America.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses how Toni Morrison's novel, Jazz, is structured like a jazz composition, with individual characters' narratives acting as solos within a larger ensemble piece.
  A: This statement is true, as the article discusses how Morrison has simulated the style of a jazz performance in the narration of Jazz.
  B: The article does not discuss any other African American novelists who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  C: The article does not make this assertion, and it is not necessarily true of all novels about nonliterary arts and artists.
  D: The article does not make this assertion, and it is not necessarily true of all novels.
  E: The article does not discuss the number of African American writers who have written novels about music or the number of non-African American writers who have done so.
Thought: 
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that no other African American writers had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in Jazz.
  This assertion would be most called into question if it were true that another African American writer had already used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B, which states that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
Criticism: 
  The article does not discuss any other African American novelists who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, and the assertion in lines 11-16 specifically refers to the use of a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel, not just the form of a novel.
  However, the assertion in lines 11-16 is still subject to challenge if any other African American writer had already used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel, regardless of the specific genre used.

  The question asks what the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if one of the choices were true.
  The author's assertion is that Toni Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, similar to the style of a jazz composition.
  A supports the author's assertion and is therefore not the correct answer.
  B, C, D, and E are not relevant to the author's assertion.
  None of the choices would call the author's assertion into question.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to jazz music.
  The passage explains that Jazz is structured similarly to the playing of a jazz band, with a collective narration and individual character voices.
Thought: 
  The author asserts that Jazz has a structure similar to the playing of a jazz band.
  Specifically, the novel has a collective narration and individual character voices.
  This structure is similar to the way Duke Ellington constructed jazz compositions.
  The author is making a comparison between the structure of Jazz and the structure of jazz music.
  Therefore, if the author's assertion is true, then it must be the case that the structure of Jazz is intentionally designed to simulate the structure of jazz music.
  Answer choice A states this explicitly, so it is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to the structure of jazz music.
  A: The author's intention in simulating jazz style in Jazz is not explicitly stated in the passage.
  B: The passage does not mention any African American novelists who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  C: The passage does not make a generalization about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists.
  D: The passage does not make a generalization about all novels being musical in nature.
  E: The passage does not provide a comparison between African American and non-African American writers in terms of their novels' plots and characters related to music.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the unique structure of Jazz and how it is analogous to jazz music.
  The author claims that no one had previously attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison's Jazz.
  The author also compares the structure of Jazz to the playing of a jazz hand in which musicians intertwine their ensemble sound with individuality of embedded solo performances.
  The author is making a claim about the uniqueness of Jazz's structure.
  None of the other options are relevant to the author's claim.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, specifically jazz music.
  The passage notes that Morrison's novel is structured in a way that simulates the style of jazz performance.
Thought:
  The author discusses how Morrison's novel is structured to simulate the style of jazz performance.
  The author notes that this connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but also in the way in which the story is told.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if it were not true that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  The answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Criticism:
  The thought process is correct in identifying that the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if it were not true that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  However, the passage actually supports this assertion and states that the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but also in the way in which the story is told.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, particularly jazz music.
Thought: 
  The author claims that Toni Morrison has found a way to create a sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. The author compares this to the way that Duke Ellington constructed his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind, but always within the composer's frame. The author suggests that this effect is achieved through the use of quotation marks around the characters' sections, which remind the reader that the narrator is allowing them to speak. 
  The author then goes on to say that Jazz redefines the possibilities of narrative point of view by simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity. 
  The question asks what assertion the author would be most called into question if a particular statement were true. 
  A: If it were true that even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story, this would not necessarily call into question the author's assertion about the use of quotation marks to achieve a sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within a fixed scope. 
  B: If it were true that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, this would not necessarily call into question the author's assertion about Jazz being the first novel to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel. 
  C: If it were true that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question, this would not necessarily call into question the author's assertion about the unique structure of Jazz. 
  D: If it were true that depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature, this would not necessarily call into question the author's assertion about the unique structure of Jazz. 
  E: If it were true that a smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music, this would not necessarily call into question the author's assertion about the unique structure of Jazz. 
  None of the options seem to directly contradict or call into question the author's assertion about the unique structure of Jazz. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, which is structured like a jazz composition.
  The narration in Jazz shifts between third-person omniscience and first-person lyricism of key characters, similar to how a jazz ensemble combines ensemble sound with individual solo performances.
Thought: 
  The author is discussing how Morrison has used the structure of jazz music to inform the structure of her novel.
  The author is making a specific assertion about Morrison's use of narration in Jazz.
  The author is not making a general statement about all novels about nonliterary arts and artists.
  The author is not making a statement about the musical nature of all novels.
  The author is not making a statement about the relative number of African American writers who have written about music compared to non-African American writers.
  Therefore, the correct answer must relate to the author's specific assertion about Morrison's use of narration in Jazz.
  The only answer choice that does this is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Criticism: 
  The author does not say that a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  However, the author does describe how Morrison's use of narration in Jazz is similar to the structure of a jazz composition. 
  So, while the wording of answer choice A is not entirely accurate, it is still the best answer choice.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, which uses the structure of jazz music in its narration.
  A: This choice says that the author intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story. This is consistent with the passage.
  B: This choice says that some African American novelists sought to base their work on the typical structure of blues music. This is not relevant to the discussion of Jazz and the structure of jazz music in its narration.
  C: This choice says that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question. This is too broad a claim and not supported by the passage.
  D: This choice says that any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature, depending on whether or not it is read aloud. This is not relevant to the discussion of Jazz and the structure of jazz music in its narration.
  E: This choice says that a smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music. This is not relevant to the discussion of Jazz and the structure of jazz music in its narration.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how Jazz uses the structure of jazz music in its narration.
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if choice A were not true.
  If the author did not intentionally try to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story, then the comparison between Jazz and the structure of jazz music would not be valid.
  Therefore, if choice A were not true, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be called into question.
  The answer is A.
Criticism: 
  This analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and its connection to music, specifically jazz music.
  The author compares the structure of the novel to the structure of a jazz composition.
  The author discusses how the narration of the novel shifts between third-person omniscience and first-person lyricism.
Thought: 
  The author discusses how Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  This is similar to the way Duke Ellington constructed his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind.
  The musicians always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame.
  Morrison has achieved this same effect in Jazz, creating the sense of improvisation within the fixed scope of a collective narration.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if it were not true that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  If Morrison did not intentionally try to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story, then the comparison to Duke Ellington's compositions and the sense of improvisation within the fixed scope of a collective narration would not hold.
  Therefore, if A were not true, the author's assertion would be most called into question.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, which draws on jazz music as a structuring principle for the entire novel.
  The author of the passage argues that Morrison's use of narration in Jazz is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz band, with individual characters' voices serving as solos within the overarching narrative.
Thought: 
  The author asserts that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  The author compares this effect to the way that a jazz band performs, with individual musicians' improvisations and solos taking place within the composer's frame.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if it were not true that Morrison's use of narration in Jazz is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz band.
  The only choice that addresses the comparison between Morrison's narration and jazz is A, which supports the author's assertion. 
  Therefore, A cannot be the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  None of the other answer choices address the author's assertion that Morrison's use of narration in Jazz is analogous to the playing of a jazz band.
  Therefore, the question is poorly constructed and does not have a clear correct answer.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.

The passage describes two sides of a debate on how to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes. One side believes that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing access to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. The other side believes that increasing fines and penalties associated with criminal activity and strengthening law enforcement is the best deterrence method. However, the passage introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, which shows that the two positions are complementary. The principle is applied to show that both methods have the same overall effect on crime deterrence. Therefore, choice B, "Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them," most accurately describes the organization of the passage.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.

  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune through the use of predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers made their predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  Their predictions were not borne out by observations.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune.
  Neptune was later discovered in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the discovery of Neptune is most analogous to the astronomers' hypothesis and subsequent discovery of Neptune.
  The answer is D: the discovery of reversed magnetic fields.
Criticism:
  The discovery of reversed magnetic fields is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  The answer should be A: Galileo's theory of tides.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the existence of a planet (Neptune) based on observations that did not match their predictions.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  B: Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is created during the decay of a neutron. The particle's existence was later confirmed. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
Thought: 
  Astronomers predicted the existence of a planet (Neptune) based on observations that did not match their predictions.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune.
  Later, scientists discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of a planet based on predictions that did not match observations.
  The answer is D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
Criticism: 
  The discovery of Bernard Brunhes is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune. 
  The discovery of Neptune is more similar to the discovery of Pluto, where astronomers predicted the existence of a planet based on observations that did not match their predictions, and later discovered Pluto in the predicted location.
  Therefore, the answer should be None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes how the discovery of Neptune was made using predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, and how the discovery increased confidence in Newton's laws.

  Therefore, the most analogous scientific episode would be one in which a deviation or anomaly led to a prediction of something previously unknown.
  The only choice that fits this description is A, where Galileo's theory of tides predicted an anomaly that led to the discovery of the existence of two high tides per day.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:

  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of reversed magnetic fields in rocks is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of an undetected particle is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus and then discovered that their predictions were incorrect.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet (Neptune) to explain the orbit of Uranus and later discovered it in the precise location it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of a planet to explain the orbit of Uranus.
  The answer is not A, B, C, D, or E.

Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the existence of Neptune based on observations of Uranus.
  They changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets and concluded that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Later, they discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of Neptune itself.
  None of the choices is the correct answer.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune based on astronomers' predictions of its orbit, which were incorrect due to an error in one of their auxiliary assumptions.
  A: Galileo's theory of tides and its false prediction is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  B: Edwin Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  C: Walter Alvarez's postulation of an asteroid impact causing dinosaur extinction is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  D: Bernard Brunhes's discovery of reversed magnetic fields is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of an undetected particle is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
Thought: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune based on the incorrect predictions of its orbit and the hypothesis of the existence of another planet in the vicinity.
  The most analogous scientific episode would be one in which a hypothesis about the existence of a previously unknown entity was made based on incorrect predictions or observations.
  Option C describes a hypothesis about the cause of dinosaur extinction based on observations of iridium levels, which was later confirmed by the discovery of an impact crater.
  This is similar to the hypothesis of the existence of another planet based on incorrect predictions of Uranus's orbit, which was later confirmed by the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Walter Alvarez's postulation of an asteroid impact causing dinosaur extinction. 
Criticism: 
  The analogy between the discovery of Neptune and Walter Alvarez's hypothesis of an asteroid impact causing dinosaur extinction is not perfect.
  The discovery of Neptune was based on incorrect predictions of its orbit, while the hypothesis of an asteroid impact was based on observations of iridium levels.
  However, both involve making a hypothesis about the existence of a previously unknown entity based on incorrect predictions or observations.
  So, while not a perfect analogy, C is still the most appropriate answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune by astronomers who used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus, but found that their predictions were incorrect.

  B: Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is created during the decay of a neutron into a proton and an electron. The particle's existence was later confirmed. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
Thought: 
  In Passage B, astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus, but found that their predictions were incorrect. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune. Later, scientists discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations. 
  The discovery of Neptune was based on the correction of an incorrect prediction by astronomers using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. 
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the correction of an incorrect prediction based on the use of Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The most analogous episode is A: Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two. 
Criticism: 
  Although the discovery of Neptune was based on the correction of an incorrect prediction by astronomers using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, it is not clear that Galileo's theory of tides is the most analogous scientific episode to this discovery.
  The choice between the options is not very clear and could be subjective.

Thought: 
  Passage B discusses how astronomers predicted the existence of Neptune based on observations of Uranus, and later discovered Neptune in the precise location predicted by their calculations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the one in which Walter Alvarez discovered high levels of iridium in rock core samples and later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
Criticism: 
  The discovery of Neptune is analogous to the discovery of a celestial body based on calculations and predictions.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.

Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.

  This illustrates the first way that art was "produced by and for political and social elites" that the author mentions.
  The author uses this example to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that fit the first way of producing art, which is not the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
  Therefore, the answer is E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
Criticism: 
  The answer is not A because the author does not use this example to illustrate the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.

  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to illustrate the second way in which art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The frescoes were commissioned by Pope Julius II, who was a member of the elite, to express and mirror his ideals and way of life.
  Therefore, the answer is C: to present an example of the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist.
Criticism:
  The author does not specifically mention that the relationship between Pope Julius II and Raphael fits the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist.
  The author mentions the frescoes as an example of the second way in which art was "produced by and for political and social elites," but does not specify that it was the most common type of relationship.
  However, given that the first way involves engaging a well-known artist to produce something for display, it is likely that the second way, which involves creating a work that expresses and mirrors one's ideals and way of life, is the more common type of relationship between a patron and an artist.
Action: Answer("C")

  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example of art produced by and for political and social elites.
  The author discusses two different ways that art was produced by and for political and social elites.
  One way was to create a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  The second way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
  Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments are an example of the first way, where art expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  Therefore, the author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to show an example of the first way that art was produced by and for political and social elites.
  The answer is A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.
Criticism: 
  Your thought process is correct.

  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments to provide an example of the first way that art was "produced by and for political and social elites" - for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
  The example is used to illustrate that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that fit the first way, which is different from the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
  Therefore, the answer is E: to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics.
Criticism:
  You could argue that while the author does use Raphael's frescoes to show that there are cases of artist/patron relationships that do not fit the pattern preferred by sociohistorical critics, the main reason for mentioning them is to contrast them with the second way that art was "produced by and for political and social elites" - to create a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  So, the answer could also be A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.

  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments as an example of a work created by a patron to express and mirror their ideals and way of life.
  This supports the second way that art was produced by and for political and social elites.
  The author also mentions that sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced in this way, so the example is relevant to a discussion of their interpretation of elitism in art.
  The example does not illustrate the influence of religion on the historical development of art, nor does it show how an artist can subvert the ideals of the patron.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
  C: a hypothetical situation supporting a statement reported by the author in the earlier lines
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 0:

Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 state that in cases where the lawyer sincerely believes the client may be innocent, the lawyer should try to prove that innocence.
  This statement supports the author's earlier position that lawyers have an obligation to the defendant to provide the best possible defense.
  The earlier position argued that lawyers should not present false assertions or defend guilty clients, but this statement does not contradict that position.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information in the two sentences and the sentence at lines 7-11 is that the former supports the latter without contradicting it.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: 
  None.

  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that lawyers should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
  This sentence relates to the earlier lines in that it discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to provide the best defense they are capable of, but in cases where the defendant is guilty, this defense should not include assertions that the lawyer knows to be false.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 is a more specific explanation of the lawyer's obligation to the defendant and the court/society that was mentioned earlier in the passage.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information contained in the two sentences is that the sentence at lines 28-31 elaborates on the lawyer's obligation to the defendant and the court/society that was introduced earlier in the passage.
  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Criticism:
  None.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients and to the court and society.

Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the obligations of defense lawyers to their clients and to the court/society.
  The passage argues that defense lawyers should not present assertions they know to be false and should not undertake to demonstrate the innocence of guilty defendants.
  The passage argues that the best defense can only be provided by an advocate who is convinced of the merits of the case.
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states that lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate the innocence of guilty defendants.
  This thought is related to the earlier lines (7-11) that discuss the obligation of lawyers to provide the best defense they are capable of.
  The argument is that the best defense can only be provided by an advocate who is convinced of the merits of the case, which includes not making false assertions or trying to prove the innocence of guilty defendants.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information contained in the two sentences is that they are related arguments about the obligations of defense lawyers.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 is a specific example or application of the general principle discussed in the earlier lines.
  The sentences are not in disagreement, but rather the second sentence provides a specific application of the general principle in the earlier lines.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.

  I stand by my analysis and answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients, the courts, and society.
  The passage argues that defense lawyers should not present false assertions to the court, even if they are convinced their clients are guilty.
  The passage also argues that defense lawyers should not take every case they are offered, but should instead be advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 7-11 states that some legal scholars argue that defense lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, without judging defendants.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 state that defense lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate the innocence of clients they are convinced are guilty.
  The two statements are related in that they both discuss the obligations of defense lawyers to their clients and the court, but take different positions on whether lawyers should defend clients they believe are guilty.
  The first statement argues that lawyers have no right to judge defendants and should provide the best defense they are capable of.
  The second statement argues that lawyers should not present false assertions to the court, even if they are convinced their clients are guilty.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences can be described as disagreement over the particulars.
  The author agrees in general with the earlier position that defense lawyers have an obligation to provide the best defense they are capable of, but disagrees over the particulars of whether lawyers should defend clients they believe are guilty.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to their clients and to the court.
  The passage argues that lawyers should not present assertions that they know to be false.
  The passage argues that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 discusses the argument that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 argue that lawyers should not undertake to demonstrate the innocence of clients who they know to be guilty.
  These sentences are presenting a different perspective on the obligations of defense lawyers than the earlier lines.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two sets of sentences can be described as different perspectives on the obligations of defense lawyers.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Criticism: 
  This answer is incorrect because the two sets of sentences are not essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 are arguing against the perspective presented in the earlier lines, that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: In what other areas besides Europe did Spanish-language proverbs currently used in Mexican American communities originate?
  B: Are any proverbs that are used frequently in the English-language tradition derived from Mexican American proverbs?

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception
  D: questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to study brain activity in response to cognitive tasks.
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from the measurement taken while the subject performs the task.
  The result is thought to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
Thought: 
  The passage compares the interpretation of FMRI scans to a subtraction method.
  In this method, one subtracts a baseline measurement from the measurement taken while the subject performs the task.
  The reasoning is that the remaining difference represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  The question asks for an analogy to this subtraction method.
  Choice A is not a good analogy because it describes a situation where one district is necessary for a candidate to win, which is not analogous to the subtraction method.
  Choice B is not a good analogy because it describes a situation where advertisements affect only summer shoppers, which is not analogous to the subtraction method.
  Choice C is not a good analogy because it describes a situation where one group is impacted more severely by droughts, which is not analogous to the subtraction method.
  Choice D is not a good analogy because it describes a situation where most Internet traffic during peak hours originates in homes, which is not analogous to the subtraction method.
  Choice E is the best analogy because it describes a situation where cheetahs are the fastest land animal only for short distances, which is analogous to the subtraction method because it involves comparing two measurements to determine the difference.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between the subtraction method and the fact that cheetahs are the fastest land animal only for short distances is not perfect.
  The subtraction method involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken during a cognitive task, whereas the fact about cheetahs involves comparing cheetahs to other land animals over long distances.
  However, this is the best analogy of the choices given.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging, specifically FMRI, in psychology research.
  FMRI produces images of the brain that show the differential rate of oxygen use between a control condition and a cognitive task.
  The subtractive method is used to interpret FMRI scans.
Thought: 
  FMRI scans show differential brain activity between a control condition and a cognitive task.
  The subtractive method is used to interpret FMRI scans.
  The subtractive method subtracts the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  The subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, potentially creating a false impression of neat functional localization.
  Which one of the following is most analogous to this method of interpretation?
  A: The victory of a newly elected mayor was due to the unusually large margin of votes in one particular district, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the world's fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
  The subtractive method isolates the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task, just as the victory of a newly elected mayor was due solely to the unusually large margin of votes in one particular district.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans, specifically FMRI, as a research method in psychology.
  The FMRI scan subtracts baseline measurements from on-task measurements to reveal areas of the brain that are active during a specific cognitive task.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans as described in the passage.
  The interpretation of the FMRI scan involves subtracting baseline measurements from on-task measurements to reveal areas of the brain that are active during a specific cognitive task.
  The analogical answer must involve subtracting something to reveal a specific result.
  Answer choice B involves subtracting the rest of the year to reveal an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so it is the most analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the way in which functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans of brain activity are interpreted.
  FMRI scans measure the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain in response to cognitive tasks.
  The scans produce images of the brain at work by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
Thought: 
  The question asks for an analogy to the way in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  FMRI scans produce images of the brain at work by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The subtraction method is used to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  One option that is analogous to this is option B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  This option involves the use of a subtraction method to isolate the impact of a particular factor (the advertising campaign) on a specific group of people (summer shoppers).
Criticism: 
  Option A is not a good analogy because it describes a situation in which a particular district is necessary for the election of a mayor, while FMRI scans do not require a specific brain region to be active in order to produce an image of brain activity.
  Option C is not a good analogy because it describes a situation in which one group is impacted more severely than another, while FMRI scans do not measure the severity of brain activity in different regions.
  Option D is not a good analogy because it describes a situation in which one group (home Internet users) is more active than another (office Internet users), while FMRI scans do not measure the activity of different groups of people.
  Option E is not a good analogy because it describes a situation in which cheetahs are fast only for short distances, while FMRI scans do not measure the speed of brain activity in different regions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans to study brain activity.
  The interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The resulting differential brain scan is interpreted as a map of metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought: 
  The interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The resulting differential brain scan is interpreted as a map of metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the most analogous situation is one in which a subset of a larger group is used to draw conclusions about the group as a whole.
  Choice A is not analogous because it is describing a situation in which one particular district is essential to a candidate's victory, rather than a subset being used to draw conclusions about the whole.
  Choice B is not analogous because it is describing a situation in which the advertising campaign had an effect only on a subset of shoppers, rather than a subset being used to draw conclusions about the whole.
  Choice C is not analogous because it is describing a situation in which one subset (agricultural customers) is impacted more severely by a drought than another subset (residential customers), rather than a subset being used to draw conclusions about the whole.
  Choice D is not analogous because it is describing a situation in which most Internet traffic during peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings, rather than a subset being used to draw conclusions about the whole.
  Choice E is not analogous because it is describing a situation in which most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances, rather than a subset being used to draw conclusions about the whole.
  None of the choices are analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D: None of the Above.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.

  None of the choices are a good analogy to the way FMRI scans are interpreted.
Criticism:
  The question asks for an analogy to the way FMRI scans are interpreted, but none of the choices are a good match for this. The question is flawed.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) in psychology, which is a research method that is based on the modular theory of mind.
  The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI actually depicts the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. 
Thought: 
  The FMRI is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, but it actually depicts the differential rate of oxygen use.
  The differential brain scans subtract out all the distributed brain functions, which produces striking images of the brain at work.
  The analogous situation is one where a measurement is taken in a control condition and is then subtracted from a measurement taken during a specific condition in order to isolate the effect of that condition.
  Option B describes a situation where a store had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Option C describes a situation where much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur. This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Option D describes a situation where internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings. This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Option E describes a situation where the cheetah is the world's fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances. This is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Option A describes a situation where one particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district. This is analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans, as it involves isolating the effect of a specific condition (in this case, the district's vote) by subtracting out the effect of other conditions (in this case, the votes from other districts).
Criticism: 
  Option A is a valid analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans, as it involves isolating the effect of a specific condition by subtracting out the effect of other conditions. However, it is not a perfect analogy and there may be other valid analogies as well.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to study brain activity.
  FMRI scans show differential rates of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from a task measurement.
  This subtraction is thought to reveal the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought:
  The FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting a baseline measurement from a task measurement.
  This subtraction is thought to reveal the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  However, this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the most analogous answer choice is one in which a specific factor is isolated and thought to be responsible for an observed effect, while other factors are overlooked.
  Answer choice B is the most analogous, as the advertisements are thought to have affected only summer shoppers, even though there may have been other factors at play.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the use of brain scans as a research method in psychology, which depends on the premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules.
  The article also discusses how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is used to measure metabolic activity in different parts of the brain.
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI technique involves taking a baseline measurement in the control condition and then subtracting it from the on-task measurement to reveal the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Thought: 
  The FMRI technique involves subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to reveal the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This is analogous to subtracting the impact of one variable from the overall effect to determine the effect of another variable.
  Option A is not analogous because it describes a district that is necessary for an outcome to occur, whereas the FMRI technique is used to isolate the impact of a particular cognitive task.
  Option B is not analogous because it describes a change that only occurs during a specific time period, whereas the FMRI technique is used to measure activity associated with a specific cognitive task.
  Option C is not analogous because it describes the relative impact of two different types of customers, whereas the FMRI technique is used to isolate the impact of a specific cognitive task.
  Option D is not analogous because it describes the timing of internet traffic, whereas the FMRI technique is used to measure metabolic activity associated with a specific cognitive task.
  Option E is not analogous because it describes the speed of cheetahs over long distances, whereas the FMRI technique is used to measure metabolic activity associated with a specific cognitive task.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. 
Criticism: 
  The analogy to option B is not perfect because the FMRI technique is used to measure metabolic activity associated with a specific cognitive task, whereas the example in option B describes the impact of an advertising campaign on a specific group of shoppers. 
  However, both involve subtracting the impact of one variable from the overall effect to determine the effect of another variable, so option B is the most similar analogy. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted. 
  The FMRI subtractive method is used to produce images of the brain at work. 
  The method subtracts the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. 
Thought: 
  The FMRI subtractive method is used to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This is done by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement. 
  Therefore, the method is most analogous to choice B, where the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. 
  Just as the FMRI method subtracts the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to isolate the cognitive task, the advertisement's impact is isolated to the summer shoppers. 
  The other choices do not directly involve the isolation or subtraction of one measurement from another.

  None.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 27 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.

Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")

The passage discusses the relationship between plants and insects and how it has led to the development of secondary substances in plants. These substances, which give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, have evolved as a result of an interaction between plants and insects. Some secondary substances attract pollinating insects, while others act as a biochemical defense against plant-eating insects. Over time, this competition has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants, as well as a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant. Therefore, the most accurate expression of the main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.

Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial
  D: theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case, before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions
  E: speculate that creating credibility in some cases is probably more effective than positively framing very harmful information
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the strategy of "stealing thunder" in courtrooms, where a lawyer reveals negative information about a client before it is revealed by the opposing lawyer.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture.
  The second version holds that multicultural education should adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that Western scientific methods are already value laden and that trying to understand non-scientific cultures through these methods is distorting.
Thought: 
  The strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would be a claim that non-scientific methods are not necessary for understanding non-Western cultures.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument and is not related to the objection.
  Option B is also irrelevant because the similarity of non-Western societies' value systems does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures with different values, but it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option D is also irrelevant because it is not related to either version of multicultural education.
  Option E is true, but it does not provide an objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  None of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  The answer is None of the Above.

  The first version promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture.
  The second version adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that the methods used are already value-laden, and it is an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  To object to this criticism, we need to show that the methods used in the second version of multicultural education are not value-laden or that using Western methods is necessary for understanding.
  Option A is irrelevant as it does not address the issue of whether using Western methods is value-laden or necessary.
  Option B is also irrelevant as it does not address the issue of whether using Western methods is value-laden or necessary.
  Option C weakens the criticism by suggesting that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, but it does not address the issue of whether using Western methods is value-laden or necessary.
  Option D is irrelevant as it does not address the issue of whether using Western methods is value-laden or necessary for understanding.
  Option E is already stated in the passage and does not provide an objection to the criticism.
  None of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism.

  The first version teaches about other cultures within the context of the majority culture's values.
  The second version takes a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still uses Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Critics argue that the second version is not essentially different from the first because Western scientific methods are value-laden and do not allow for an adequate understanding of non-Western cultures.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that Western scientific methods are value-laden and thus distort other cultures.
  To provide a strong objection to this criticism, we need to show that Western scientific methods are not value-laden or that other cultures use Western scientific methods to study cultures with different values.
  Choice A is irrelevant because the criticism is not about whether it is possible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because the criticism is not about the similarity of the value systems of non-Western societies.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because the criticism is not about whether some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures with different values.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because the criticism is not about whether students in Western societies can understand their own culture's achievements.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it merely restates the premise that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
  None of the choices provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

  The first proposal advocates teaching about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture.
  The second proposal advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still using Western scientific methods.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that the scientific methods are already value-laden and Eurocentric.
Thought: 
  The strongest objection to the criticism of the second proposal would be an argument that the scientific methods used are not necessarily Eurocentric and value-laden, but can be used in a way that is culturally sensitive and respectful of other perspectives.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument being made.
  Option B is also not relevant to the argument being made.
  Option C does not provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second proposal, as it does not address the issue of whether the scientific methods are culturally sensitive or Eurocentric.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument being made.
  Option E is not a statement, but a general point that is already acknowledged in the passage.
  Therefore, none of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second proposal.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The second version of multicultural education adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still uses Western scientific methods.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that Western scientific methods are already value laden, and that to understand non-scientific cultures, one must adopt their own perspectives and methods.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to this criticism would be an argument that Western scientific methods are not value laden, and can provide a neutral and objective understanding of non-Western cultures.
  Option D is not relevant to the discussion of multicultural education, and option E is a restatement of the criticism, not an objection.
  Option A is not necessarily true; one can adopt the perspectives and methods of another culture through study and immersion.
  Option B suggests that non-Western societies have similarities in their values, but this does not address the use of Western scientific methods in the study of non-Western cultures.
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures, which is consistent with the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Therefore, option C is not a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Criticism: 
  N/A
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal advocates teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture's methods, perspectives, and values.
  The second proposal advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures and using Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that the Western scientific heritage is already value-laden and that understanding other cultures requires adopting their perspectives and methods.
Thought: 
  The strongest objection to the criticism of the second proposal would be that it is possible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture without being a member of that culture.
  If this were true, then the second proposal could genuinely lead to understanding other cultures without being distorted by the Western scientific perspective.
  A, B, C, D do not provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second proposal.
  E is not relevant to the question.
  Therefore, the answer is A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that if it were impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture without being a member of that culture, then the second proposal would be problematic.
  However, the passage does not provide evidence to support or refute this claim.
  Therefore, while A is a possible objection to the criticism of the second proposal, it is not necessarily the strongest objection.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version holds that schools should teach about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture.
  The second version holds that multicultural education should adopt a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that it is still Western-centric because it uses Western scientific methods.
Thought: 
  The strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would be if there were a way to understand non-Western cultures using Western scientific methods without distorting them.
  Option A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that one must be a member of a culture to adopt its perspectives and methods.
  Option B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that non-Western societies are similar to one another.
  Option C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying other cultures.
  Option D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Western scientific investigations are necessary for understanding Western culture's achievements.
  Option E is incorrect because it is a restatement of the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it still relies on Western methods of examination and study. 
  The strongest objection to this criticism would be to show that the Western methods are not the only ones that can be used to achieve genuine understanding of other cultures.
  Option C provides such an objection by stating that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  Therefore, C is the correct answer.
Criticism: 
  None.

  The first version promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture, using the values of liberalism.
  The second version holds that multicultural education should be neutral with respect to value differences among cultures, but still uses Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting and an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting and an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  To provide the strongest objection to this criticism, we need to find a statement that shows that using Western scientific methods is not distorting or an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Option A is not a strong objection because it does not address the criticism of using Western scientific methods.
  Option B is not a strong objection because it acknowledges that there are value systems that are different from the Western liberal values.
  Option C is not a strong objection because it only says that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures, but it does not address the criticism of using Western scientific methods.
  Option D is not a strong objection because it is not relevant to the criticism of using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures.
  Option E is not a strong objection because it is already assumed in the passage that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
  None of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version advocates teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture's values.
  The second version is neutral with respect to value differences among cultures, but still uses Western scientific methods.
  Critics of the second version argue that the methods are already value-laden and are an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
Thought: 
  The proponents of the second version of multicultural education would likely object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  This is because they argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and that the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  Thus, using these methods to investigate a nonscientific culture would be seen as an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism:
  Your thought process is correct based on the information provided in the passage.
  However, it is possible that proponents of the second version of multicultural education may not object to a study that employs Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture if it is done in a way that is sensitive to the culture's own ways of knowing and understanding.
  Therefore, while C is the most likely answer, it is not necessarily the only answer.

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two different proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal involves teaching about other cultures using the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture (liberalism).
  The second proposal involves adopting a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures, but still using Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Critics of the second proposal argue that this approach is still value-laden and distorting.
Thought: 
  The proponents of the second version of multicultural education would object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture because this approach is still value-laden and distorting, according to the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. The proponents of the second version of multicultural education would object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture because it is still value-laden and distorting, as argued by the critics in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version promotes multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture's values.
  The second version advocates for a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still uses Western methods of examination, study, and explanation.
  Critics of both versions have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective or Western scientific perspective.
Thought: 
  The question asks which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.
  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education, which advocates for a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still uses Western methods of examination, study, and explanation.
  The critics of this version argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.
  The answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.
  However, it is important to note that the passage does not explicitly state that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would find a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture objectionable.
  The passage only provides the critics' argument that the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first because it still uses Western methods of examination, study, and explanation.
  Therefore, while C is the most likely answer, it is not explicitly stated in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version proposes teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture.
  The second version proposes adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still using Western methods of examination.
  Critics of the second version argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and may not be suitable for understanding nonscientific cultures.
Thought:
  The proponents of the second version of multicultural education hold that each culture should be taken on its own terms without imposing Western values.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the second version of multicultural education.
  The passage suggests that to understand nonscientific cultures, one needs to adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  Thus, using Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture may be seen as an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  The answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism:
  The answer is correct given the information in the passage. 
  However, it is possible that proponents of the second version of multicultural education may not object to all studies that employ Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  It depends on the specific methods used and the cultural context of the study.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two different proposals for multicultural education.
  The first proposal involves teaching about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture.
  The second proposal involves adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still using Western scientific methods of examination.
  Critics argue that both proposals are flawed because they involve a distortion of the cultures being studied.
Thought: 
  The third paragraph discusses a criticism of the second proposal for multicultural education.
  The criticism is that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and involve a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  Therefore, the objectionable study would be one that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture, as this would be seen as distorting the culture being studied.
  The answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
  However, proponents of the second proposal might not find a study that uses the methods of Western science objectionable, as long as it is done while being aware of the limitations and potential biases of those methods.
  Therefore, the answer is not necessarily C, and it could be argued that none of the answer choices are entirely correct.

  The answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism: 
  The answer is correct. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education.
  The first version holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture.
  The second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
Thought: 
  The third paragraph discusses an objection to the second version of multicultural education.
  This objection argues that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are value-laden and thus already distorting.
  The objection further argues that to insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.
  The answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Criticism: 
  None. The analysis is consistent with the information presented in the passage.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
  D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.

  The author describes prions as a new type of pathogen that reproduce and cause cellular destruction without nucleic acid. 
  The author also describes CJD as inevitably fatal with no effective therapy and no immune response from the body. 
  Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  The answer is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that any patients with CJD will recover from the disease.
  This statement contradicts the information provided in the passage that CJD is inevitably fatal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions, an entirely new class of infectious pathogens, and their link to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  The prions responsible for CJD lack nucleic acid and consist mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues but possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape.
  Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way.
Thought: 
  The author discusses the discovery of prions and their link to CJD.
  The author emphasizes that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens and that they reproduce in an unexpected way.
  The author also notes that the body has no natural defense against CJD.
  The author does not mention any possibility of patients currently infected with CJD recovering from the disease.
  Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Criticism: 
  There is no mention in the passage of any possibility of patients currently infected with CJD recovering from the disease.
  Therefore, it is unclear whether the author would agree or disagree with this statement.
  However, the passage does state that CJD is inevitably fatal, so it is more likely that the author would disagree with the statement that some patients will recover.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility, given a choice of actions.
Thought: 
  A: The waiter is concealing his tip income to reduce his taxes, which would increase his overall satisfaction. He believes it is unlikely that he will be caught, which would increase his expected utility from the action. This is a rational response to economic incentives.
  B: The motorist is avoiding speeding on a heavily patrolled road to avoid losing her driver's license, which would decrease her overall satisfaction. She knows that a speeding ticket is likely, which would decrease her expected utility from the action. This is a rational response to economic disincentives.
  C: The industrialist is continuing to illegally discharge pollutants into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant, which would increase his overall satisfaction. He believes it is unlikely that he will be caught, which would increase his expected utility from the action. This is a rational response to economic incentives.
  D: The government official is risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because her government salary is inadequate to support her and her family, which would increase her overall satisfaction. She is aware of the risk of prosecution, which would decrease her expected utility from the action. This is a rational response to economic incentives.
  E: The worker is physically assaulting his former supervisor because he believes the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair, which would increase his overall satisfaction. However, physical assault is an illegal action that would likely result in negative consequences, including potential legal action and social stigma. This is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives.
Criticism: 
  All of the options except for E seem to be rational responses to economic incentives or disincentives. However, it is worth noting that there may be other factors at play in each scenario that are not fully captured by the information provided in the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
Thought: 
  The question asks for the least appropriate response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  A, B, C, and D all involve individuals weighing costs and benefits and making rational decisions based on those calculations.
  E, however, involves an impulsive crime of passion, which is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives.
  Therefore, E is the least appropriate response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:

  D: The government official is responding rationally to economic incentives and disincentives by risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: The worker is not responding rationally to economic incentives and disincentives by physically assaulting his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Criticism: 
  The worker in option E is not responding rationally to economic incentives and disincentives by physically assaulting his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. The worker is responding impulsively to the situation, and the action is not a result of rational decision making.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.
  D: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  E: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:

  The author is critical of the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies because it has focused exclusively on written documents and has overlooked traditional modes of communicating personal history.
  The author believes that scholars have failed to address the cultural constructs of Native American peoples and have not recognized the diversity of their cultures.
  The author also believes that the traditional modes of communicating personal history used by Native Americans are just as valid as written documents and may even be more inclusive and expressive.
  Therefore, the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies is negative and critical.
  The phrase that best conveys this attitude is "failed to address" (line 9), as it suggests that the earlier scholarship has a significant flaw and has overlooked important aspects of Native American culture.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism
  D: admiration for its subtle critique of contemporary culture
  E: appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increased size and specialization, leading to increasing returns to scale.
  However, increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power and limit competition.
Thought:
  The question asks which statement would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  A: This statement suggests that larger businesses do not always have a monopoly in an industry, which weakens the connection between increased size and monopoly power. However, it does not address the fact that increasing returns to scale can still lead to monopoly power.
  B: This statement discusses the impact on worker salaries and does not address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  C: This statement acknowledges that businesses can collude to set prices, but it does not address the relationship between increased size and monopoly power.
  D: This statement suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns to scale varies, which weakens the connection between increased size and monopoly power. If the size needed to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely, then it may not always lead to monopoly power.
  E: This statement suggests that increasing specialization may lead to diminishing returns, which weakens the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  D and E are both plausible, but D seems to more directly address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The author discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increased size and specialization in achieving greater efficiency and productivity.
  However, increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly, which undermines the benefits of the Invisible Hand.
Thought:
  The author draws a connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Therefore, any answer choice that undermines this connection would weaken the author's argument.
  A: This answer choice describes a situation where larger businesses do not have monopoly power in all regions.
      This does not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  B: This answer choice discusses the effect on worker salaries and is not relevant to the author's argument.
  C: This answer choice describes collusion among businesses, which is a form of monopoly power.
      This reinforces the author's argument rather than undermining it.
  D: This answer choice suggests that the size required for increasing returns varies by industry.
      This could weaken the author's argument by suggesting that not all industries will experience natural monopoly as they grow larger.
  E: This answer choice suggests that there are limits to how much specialization can increase productivity.
      This is not relevant to the author's argument.
  Therefore, D is the best answer choice.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the huge increases in efficiency that can be achieved through increased size.
  The Invisible Hand recognizes how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good.
  Increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which undermines the idea of the Invisible Hand.
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which undermines the idea of the Invisible Hand.
  If there were a way to achieve increasing returns to scale without creating a natural tendency toward monopoly, the author's argument would be undermined.
  Therefore, the answer is the choice that describes such a way.
  Choice D describes how the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  This suggests that not all industries will experience a natural tendency toward monopoly as they grow larger.
  Therefore, choice D would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increasing size and specialization in a business, which can lead to increasing returns to scale.
  The Invisible Hand emphasizes how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, but requires many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power.
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopoly power, which undermines the Invisible Hand.
  Therefore, evidence that increasing returns to scale do not lead to monopoly power would undermine the author's argument.
  Choice A suggests that larger businesses do not always have monopoly power, which undermines the author's argument.
  Choices B, C, D, and E do not address the connection between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the benefits of increased size and specialization, leading to increasing returns to scale.
  The Invisible Hand emphasizes the benefits of competition and self-interest leading to the common good.
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power, which undermines competition and the benefits of the Invisible Hand.
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power. 
  This is because larger firms can achieve lower costs and drive smaller firms out of business. 
  If true, option C would most undermine the author's argument. 
  This is because it suggests that even when there are only a few players in an industry, they can still collude and set prices as high as a true monopoly, despite the presence of larger firms in the same industry.
  This would suggest that competition is not effective in preventing the negative effects of monopoly power.
  Therefore, the answer is C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
Criticism: 
  The other options do not directly address the connection between increased size and monopoly power, which is the focus of the author's argument.
  Option A suggests that there may be regional monopolies, but it does not address the effects of increasing returns to scale.
  Option B suggests that increased specialization may not lead to higher salaries, but it does not address the effects of increased size.
  Option D suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns may vary, but it does not address the negative effects of increasing returns.
  Option E suggests that there may be offsetting factors to increased specialization, but it does not address the effects of increased size on monopoly power.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the inherent contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the efficiency gains that come from increased size and specialization.
  The Invisible Hand emphasizes how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading to competition and reasonable prices.
  The Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand are opposed to each other because increasing returns to scale can create a tendency toward monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power, which undermines the Invisible Hand.
  If there were evidence that increasing returns to scale did not lead to monopoly power, it would undermine the author's argument.
  Option A suggests that even when there are larger businesses in the same industry, smaller businesses can still exert monopoly power in certain regions.
  This undermines the idea that bigger firms always drive smaller firms out of business and dominate the industry.
  Therefore, Option A would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("A")

  The Pin Factory represents the concept of increasing returns to scale, which can lead to natural monopoly.
  The Invisible Hand represents the concept of harnessing self-interest to the common good in a market economy.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the idea of free markets always getting it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  If there are industries where increasing returns to scale do not lead to monopoly power, then the author's argument is weakened.
  Option A suggests that there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions, but smaller businesses can still exert monopoly power in certain regions.
  This implies that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power.
  Therefore, option A would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The author describes a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes that there are increasing returns to scale, which can lead to monopoly power.
  The Invisible Hand relies on competition to prevent monopoly power and promote self-interest for the common good.
Thought: 
  The author argues that the Pin Factory contradicts the Invisible Hand because increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power, which undermines competition.
  To undermine this connection, we need to show that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power or that competition can still exist despite increasing returns.
  A: This statement does not undermine the connection because it acknowledges that some businesses can exert monopoly power, even if they are not the largest in the industry. This is consistent with the idea that increasing returns can lead to monopoly power.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power.
  C: This statement supports the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power because it acknowledges that businesses can collude to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: This statement could undermine the connection if it is true that the size needed for increasing returns varies widely from industry to industry. This would suggest that not all industries are prone to monopoly power despite increasing returns.
  E: This statement suggests that there are limits to the gains from specialization, which could prevent increasing returns from leading to monopoly power.
Criticism: 
  Option D is somewhat vague and does not provide enough information to determine whether or not it undermines the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power.
  Option E is plausible, but it is not clear whether it is enough to completely undermine the connection.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The author argues that there is a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory demonstrates that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power.
  The Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power.
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly power.
  If it were true that increasing returns to scale did not always lead to monopoly power, then the author's argument would be undermined.
  Answer choice A suggests that larger businesses do not always dominate smaller businesses in every region, which weakens the argument that increasing returns lead to monopoly power.
  Answer choice B discusses the effect of specialization on worker salaries, which is not directly related to the argument.
  Answer choice C suggests that businesses collude to set prices, which reinforces the argument that larger businesses can exert monopoly power.
  Answer choice D suggests that not all industries experience increasing returns to scale at the same size, which does not necessarily undermine the argument but rather suggests that there is variation across industries.
  Answer choice E suggests that there are offsetting factors that can limit the gains from increasing returns to scale, which does not necessarily undermine the argument but rather suggests that there are other factors at play.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
Criticism: 
  None.
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the relationship between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand as described by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations.
  Smith emphasized the efficiency gains from increased size and specialization of workers in the Pin Factory.
  However, increasing returns to scale can lead to natural tendencies towards monopoly, which can undermine the Invisible Hand's ability to work properly.
Thought:
  The author argues that there is a connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  If there is evidence that such a connection does not exist, it would undermine the author's argument.
  Choice A suggests that larger businesses do not necessarily have monopoly power, as some smaller businesses can still exert monopoly power in certain regions.
  Therefore, choice A would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society
  E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A is about Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, which concerns the power of negative evidence. Popper believed that scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. A theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable. 
  Passage B illustrates the process of predicting a planet's orbit and how scientists revise their theories and auxiliary assumptions to account for discrepancies between their predictions and observations.

  Passage A is about the power of negative evidence and the importance of testable predictions in scientific research. 
  Passage B is about how scientists used observations to revise their theories and auxiliary assumptions to account for discrepancies between their predictions and observations. 
  The process of revising a theory is mentioned in Passage A and illustrated in Passage B. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: revising a theory.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's philosophy of science and the role of negative evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B illustrates how astronomers revised their theories and auxiliary assumptions based on observations and predictions of planetary orbits.
Thought: 
  In Passage B, astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but their predictions were incorrect. They revised their assumptions and hypothesized the existence of another planet, which was later discovered. Similarly, they predicted the orbit of Mercury using Newton's laws and hypothesized the existence of another planet, but that planet was never found. However, when Einstein's theory of relativity was introduced, calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and increased confidence in Einstein's theory. This illustrates the process of revising a theory and auxiliary assumptions based on observations and predictions.
Therefore, the answer is B: revising a theory. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the power of negative evidence in Popper's philosophy of science and how scientific research involves generating bold theories and searching for evidence that would disprove them. It also mentions that when a prediction fails, there is usually more than one possible explanation and that positive evidence is never conclusive. 
  Passage B provides an example of astronomers attempting to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, and how they revised their assumptions about the existence of other planets when their predictions were not borne out. It also mentions how later astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Mercury to explain the observed orbit, and how Einstein's theory of relativity eventually led to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses the importance of searching for evidence that would disprove theories and how positive evidence has no value as evidence. 
  Passage B illustrates this by showing how astronomers revised their assumptions about the existence of other planets when their predictions were not borne out, and how they hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Mercury to explain the observed orbit.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the economic efficiency and convenience of digital publishing compared to traditional publishing.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification, and argues that juries are not equipped to make decisions about the law.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful check on the power of police and prosecutors, and can also serve as a feedback mechanism to the legislature.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that juries are not equipped to make decisions about the law, and that they should not have the power to nullify verdicts.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful check on the power of police and prosecutors, and can also serve as a feedback mechanism to the legislature.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether jury nullification is a useful check on the power of police and prosecutors, or whether it is a problematic practice that undermines the rule of law.
  The answer is B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.
Criticism: 
  The passages do not seem to disagree over whether laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people. 
  Both passages acknowledge that reasonable people can disagree over the proper reach of the criminal laws, and that the legislature is the proper place for such disagreements to be resolved.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification and argues that the power of nullification should not be used by juries.
  Passage B argues that the power of nullification can be a useful tool for juries to indicate to the legislature that there may be a problem with a law and that juries can act as a safety valve to prevent overzealous police and prosecutors.
Thought:
  The authors of the passages would disagree over whether juries should have the power of nullification.
  Passage A argues that jury nullification is a problem because juries are not legislators, may have insufficient evidence, and are unaccountable.
  Passage B argues that the power of nullification can be a useful tool for juries to indicate to the legislature that there may be a problem with a law and that juries can act as a safety valve to prevent overzealous police and prosecutors.
  The authors would disagree over whether juries should have the power of nullification.
  The authors do not express disagreement over options A, B, C, or E.
  Option D is a possible point of disagreement between the authors.
Criticism:
  The authors may not necessarily disagree over whether juries should have the power of nullification. Rather, they may have different views on when and how juries should use this power.
  Option D is not a clear point of disagreement between the authors.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification, including the unknown frequency of its use, the fact that juries may not have sufficient evidence to make a reasoned decision, and the fact that juries are not legislators. 
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous, and can assist the legislature by indicating potential problems with a law. It also suggests that instances of nullification based on factors that should be ignored are likely to be uncommon.
Thought: 
  The authors of the passages seem to have different opinions on whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it. Passage A argues that juries are not legislators and should not have the power to interpret laws, while Passage B suggests that jury nullification can assist the legislature by indicating problems with a law. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism: 
  The passages do not directly address the issue of whether juries can interpret the law, but rather focus on the problems and benefits of jury nullification. 
  While Passage A suggests that juries are not legislators and should not have the power to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others, it does not explicitly state that juries cannot interpret the law. 
  Similarly, while Passage B suggests that nullification can assist the legislature by indicating potential problems with a law, it does not explicitly state that juries can interpret the law.
Action: Answer("D")

  Passage A discusses the problems with jury nullification, including that it is unknown how often it occurs, jurors may have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned decision, and jurors are not legislators.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful safety valve in cases where police and prosecutors may be overzealous, and can also assist the legislature in identifying problems with laws.
Thought: 
  Both passages agree that jury nullification can be useful in some cases, but Passage A is more skeptical about the power of juries and the potential problems with nullification, while Passage B is more positive about the role of juries in scrutinizing laws and police/prosecutorial decisions.
  A: Both passages suggest that juries are not required to explain their verdicts and that this lack of transparency can be a problem, so they would likely agree that juries should be more forthcoming about their reasoning. 
  B: Both passages suggest that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people, so they would likely agree that this is an important aspect of the legal system.
  C: Passage A expresses concern about the potential for jury bias or misuse of power, while Passage B suggests that juries can be a check on the biases of elected officials. Therefore, the authors might disagree on this point.
  D: Passage A argues that juries are not legislators and should not interpret the law, while Passage B suggests that juries can play a role in interpreting and scrutinizing laws. Therefore, the authors might disagree on this point.
  E: Passage B argues that police and prosecutors can be overzealous and that jury nullification can be a useful check on their discretion, while Passage A does not address this issue directly. Therefore, the authors might not have a clear disagreement on this point.
Criticism: 
  The authors of the passages might have different views on the level of bias or impartiality of elected officials versus jurors, so it is not clear whether they would disagree on this point.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification and argues that the jury is unelected and unaccountable, and that juries often lack sufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. 
  Passage B argues that jury nullification serves as a safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous, and that juries can assist the legislature by nullifying in cases where a law is unjust or inapplicable to a particular defendant.
Thought:
  The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether juries should have the power to nullify laws. 
  Passage A argues that this power is problematic because juries lack accountability, often have insufficient evidence, and are not elected or appointed to interpret laws. 
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can assist the legislature and serve as a safety valve against overzealous law enforcement. 
  Therefore, the authors may disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  The correct answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism:
  The authors may also disagree over the extent to which police and prosecutors should have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue.
Action: Answer(D)
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by the jury's power to nullify, including the fact that juries are not required to explain their verdicts, often lack sufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, and are not legislators. 
  Passage B argues that the jury can act as a safety valve to prevent overzealous officials from pursuing trivial or unjust cases, and that nullification can also serve to indicate to the legislature that there may be a problem with a particular law.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that the jury is not a suitable entity to interpret laws, while Passage B suggests that the jury can help to identify issues with the law. 
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  The answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Criticism: 
  The passages do not necessarily address the question of whether juries can interpret the law, but rather whether they should nullify in disregard of the judge's instructions. 
  Therefore, the correct answer may be difficult to determine based on the given information.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration
  D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  E: Some of the refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the debate over whether biotechnology should be patentable and the potential impact of biotechnology patents on basic research.
  A: The article does not discuss the reasons why scientists shared research materials in the early days of biotechnology.
  B: The article suggests that some academic researchers fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials, but it does not state that this is always the case.
  C: The article suggests that the cost of patent litigation may deter patent holders from trying to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials, but it does not state that this is always the case.
  D: The article suggests that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly believe that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential, but it does not state that they rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: The article does not suggest that scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.
Thought: 
  The article suggests that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate and that patents are unlikely to be enforced against noncommercial research. 
  The author seems to be arguing that the benefits of patenting biotechnology outweigh the potential harm to basic research. 
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with choice D: "Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results." 
Criticism: 
  The author does not explicitly state that biotechnology researchers rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results. The article suggests that biotechnology researchers increasingly believe that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential, but it does not state that they rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.

  A: The passage does not make any statements about why scientists freely shared research materials in the early days of biotechnology research.
  B: The passage does not make any definitive statements about whether corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The passage suggests that the cost of patent litigation may be a check on patent holders who might try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials, but it does not make a definitive statement on this point.
  D: The passage suggests that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly support intellectual property protection for their research because of their reliance on research funding that is conditional on patentability, but it does not make a definitive statement on whether they rely too heavily on such funding.
  E: The passage suggests that scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because they fear that patents will limit access to research materials and hinder basic research, not because their work is not innovative enough to qualify for patent protection.
Thought: 
  The passage argues that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate and that patents are unlikely to be enforced against researchers engaged in basic and noncommercial research. 
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that biotechnology patents can spur basic research without hindering it.
  The closest option is C, which suggests that the cost of patent litigation may be an effective check on patent holders who might try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Criticism: 
  While the passage suggests that patent litigation is expensive and may deter patent holders from enforcing their patents against researchers engaged in basic and noncommercial research, it does not definitively state that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might try to prevent such research.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the debate surrounding the patenting of biotechnology.
  It highlights concerns about restrictions on access to research materials arising from patent enforcement.
  The article notes that patent litigation is expensive and usually only initiated to protect a market position.
Thought: 
  The author argues that concerns about patent enforcement hindering basic research are misplaced.
  Patent litigation is expensive and usually only initiated to protect a market position.
  Judges have traditionally respected a non-commercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Patents incentivize innovation and are unlikely to hinder basic research.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the debate over whether biotechnology inventions should be patentable and the potential impact of patenting on basic research.
  A: The passage does not discuss whether scientists in the early days of biotechnology research were entitled to intellectual property protection.
  B: The passage does not make a definitive statement about whether corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The passage suggests that the cost of patent litigation is one factor that may deter patent holders from trying to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials, but it does not make a definitive statement about the effectiveness of this check.
  D: The passage mentions that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly support intellectual property protection because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results, but it does not suggest that they rely too heavily on such funding.
  E: The passage does not suggest that scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.
Thought: 
  The author argues that patents are likely to spur rather than hinder basic research, because they provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. The author also suggests that concerns about patent holders trying to prevent researchers from using patented materials may be overstated, given the costs and limitations of patent litigation and the tradition of respecting a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Therefore, the author would likely agree with a statement that supports the idea that patents incentivize innovation and that concerns about restricting access to patented materials are overstated.
  Answer A is incorrect because the passage does not discuss whether scientists in the early days of biotechnology research were entitled to intellectual property protection.
  Answer B is incorrect because the passage does not make a definitive statement about whether corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  Answer C is partly correct in that the passage suggests that the cost of patent litigation is one factor that may deter patent holders from trying to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials. However, the passage does not make a definitive statement about the effectiveness of this check.
  Answer D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  Answer E is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.

  B: The passage does not make a blanket statement about corporate patent holders typically charging excessive fees, but rather discusses the fear of some researchers that this may happen.
  C: The passage discusses how the cost of patent litigation is a deterrent for patent holders to prevent researchers from using patented materials. It does not say that it is an effective check.
  D: The passage mentions that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly believe in intellectual property protection because of their reliance on research funding that is conditional on patentability.
  E: The passage does not suggest that scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not innovative enough.
Thought: 
  The author argues against the idea that patenting biological materials in biotechnology hinders basic research.
  The author suggests that patents actually spur basic research by providing scientists with an incentive to innovate.
  The author also argues that it is unlikely that patents will be enforced against researchers conducting basic and noncommercial research.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that biotechnology patents provide a compelling incentive to innovate.
  The answer is E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.
Criticism: 
  The statement in option E is not entirely accurate and may be a misinterpretation of the passage.
  The passage does not suggest that scientists who oppose patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not innovative enough, but rather that they fear restrictions on access to research materials and the impact of patenting on basic research.
  The author does argue that patents provide an incentive to innovate, but this is not the same as saying that only sufficiently innovative work qualifies for patent protection.
Action: Answer("E")

  The author also acknowledges concerns about the potential for high fees for the use of patented materials but does not suggest that this is typical of all corporate patent holders.
  Based on this, the most likely statement that the author would agree with is that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the use of intellectual property protection in the biotechnology industry and the concerns that researchers have about access to research materials that are subject to patents. 
  A: The passage does not directly address whether or not scientists were entitled to intellectual property protection in the early days of biotechnology research.
  B: The passage does not make a definitive statement about whether corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees.
  C: The passage suggests that the cost of patent litigation is one factor that may discourage patent holders from trying to prevent researchers from using patented materials, but it does not say that this is an "effective check."
  D: The passage mentions that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly support intellectual property protection because of their reliance on research funding that is partially contingent on patentability.
  E: The passage suggests that some scientists who oppose patenting biotechnology materials may be confused about the relationship between patent rights and access to materials, but it does not suggest that their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.
Thought:
  The author argues that concerns about access to research materials are not necessarily a result of patenting, but rather of contractual agreements or enforcement of patent rights.
  The author suggests that patents can actually spur innovation and that the cost of patent litigation may discourage patent holders from trying to prevent researchers from using patented materials.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that biotechnology patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  The answer is not A, B, C, or D.
  The author does not address whether or not scientists were entitled to intellectual property protection in the early days of biotechnology research (A), whether corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees (B), or whether the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders (C). 
  The author does argue that biotechnology researchers are increasingly supportive of intellectual property protection (D), but this is not the statement with which the author would be most likely to agree. 
Criticism:
  It is possible that the author might agree with statement D, as it is mentioned in the passage that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly support intellectual property protection. However, the author's argument is primarily focused on the benefits of patenting for innovation and the potential misunderstandings about the relationship between patents and access to research materials. Therefore, the author would probably be more likely to agree with the statement about the benefits of patents than the statement about academic researchers relying too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on patentability.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the debate surrounding the patenting of biotechnology and its potential impact on basic research.
  A: The passage does not discuss why scientists freely shared research materials in the early days of biotechnology research.
  B: The passage does not make a definitive statement regarding the fees charged by corporate patent holders for the use of patented materials.
  C: The passage suggests that the cost of patent litigation may serve as a check on patent holders who might try to prevent researchers from using patented materials, but it does not state that this is an "effective" check.
  D: The passage mentions that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly support intellectual property protection for their research results, in part because of their reliance on research funding that is partially contingent on patentability.
  E: The passage suggests that scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so out of concern that patents will restrict access to research materials and hinder basic research. The passage does not suggest that these scientists oppose patenting because their work is not innovative enough to qualify for patent protection.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the potential threat to basic research from the patenting of biotechnology is related to restrictions on access to research materials, and that some researchers fear that patent holders may attempt to prevent further research or charge prohibitively high fees for the use of patented materials. The author argues that these concerns are largely unfounded, as patents do not necessarily imply the right to deny access, and patent litigation is an expensive and unlikely option for patent holders seeking to prevent basic research. The author also suggests that patents may actually encourage innovation by providing scientists with an incentive to create new discoveries. Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that biotechnology patents are not likely to hinder basic research.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation

Thought: 
  The question is asking which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that CFCs damage the ozone layer by reacting with it in the presence of ultraviolet radiation.
  Therefore, an ideal replacement for CFCs would be a chemical that does not react with ozone or that does not break down into chemicals that react with ozone.
  Answer choice A does not address whether the chemical would react with ozone.

  The passage does not provide a clear answer to this question.
  However, we know that CFCs are damaging to the ozone layer because they contain chlorine, which chemically reacts with ozone and destroys it.
  Therefore, an experiment that tests whether a particular chemical would chemically react with chlorine would be most useful in determining whether it could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that an experiment that tests whether a particular chemical would chemically react with chlorine would be useful in determining whether it could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.

  The passage does not provide a clear answer to this question.
  However, the passage does describe the chemistry of how CFCs affect the ozone layer.
  Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, and D because they do not directly relate to this chemistry.
  Option C is partially related to the chemistry, but it only tests whether the chemical would react with chlorine, not whether it would damage the ozone layer.
  Option E is directly related to the chemistry described in the passage.
  If a chemical breaks down into harmful components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, it is likely to be harmful to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation would be the most useful experiment in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.

  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that CFCs release chlorine that ultimately destroys the ozone layer.
  However, testing whether a chemical would chemically react with chlorine is not sufficient to determine whether it could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Other factors, such as the chemical's stability, volatility, and persistence in the atmosphere, would also need to be considered.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, which concerns the power of negative evidence.
  Passage B provides an example of how scientists used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions based on observations, which led them to discover Neptune and hypothesize the existence of Vulcan.
Thought: 
  The question asks which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26).
  In Passage A, disturbing forces are mentioned as one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists use to derive predictions from a theory.
  In Passage B, the auxiliary assumptions used to predict the orbit of Uranus included the assumption that no planets existed in its vicinity.
  The astronomers changed this assumption based on observations and discovered Neptune.
  Therefore, Neptune is the most likely answer since it was a previously unknown object that disturbed the original assumptions.
  The other choices (A, B, D, and E) are not directly related to the concept of disturbing forces.
Criticism: 
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force, but the concept is not directly mentioned in Passage B.
  The passage does describe how scientists changed their assumptions based on observations, leading them to discover Neptune and hypothesize the existence of Vulcan.
  However, this is not necessarily the same as a "disturbing force".
  The passage also mentions the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets as auxiliary assumptions, which could also be considered "disturbing forces" in a broader sense.
  Therefore, the answer is not entirely clear-cut.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Popper's philosophy of science and his views on negative and positive evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the subsequent discovery of Neptune, as well as the prediction of Mercury's orbit and the discovery of Einstein's theory of relativity.
  Disturbing forces, as described in Passage A, refer to additional premises that may affect the outcome of experiments or predictions.
Thought:
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force as described in Passage A.
  Passage B discusses the prediction of Uranus's orbit and the subsequent discovery of Neptune.
  The astronomers based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, including the assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  However, the observed orbit was incorrect, and the astronomers changed their assumptions to include the existence of another planet.
  This change in assumption could be considered a disturbing force, as it affected the prediction of Uranus's orbit.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism:
  There is no clear indication in Passage B that the change in assumption about the existence of other planets was due to a disturbing force, as described in Passage A.
  It is possible that the change in assumption was simply a result of new information or a correction of an earlier assumption.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A describes Popper's philosophy of science, which emphasizes the importance of negative evidence and the search for evidence that would disprove a theory. 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Uranus and Neptune, and the attempts to predict their orbits using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  A disturbing force is an auxiliary premise that is assumed to be absent in order to derive a theory's predictions.
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that auxiliary premises, which appeal to other theories or to the correct functioning of instrumentation, can be disturbing forces that can lead to incorrect predictions.
  Passage B describes how astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus, which could be a disturbing force that led to an incorrect prediction.
  The astronomers later changed their assumption about the existence of other planets, and the discovery of Neptune confirmed their revised prediction.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune, which was the planet that was discovered to be close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. 
  However, it should be noted that the phrase "disturbing force" is not used explicitly in passage B, and it may not be immediately clear to the reader which of the options is the best answer.
  It may be helpful to provide a definition or explanation of what a disturbing force is, and to point out that the auxiliary assumption about the absence of other planets near Uranus could be considered a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Popper's philosophy of science, which involves the power of negative evidence.
  Passage A argues that negative evidence is at the heart of scientific research.
  Passage A argues that a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable.
  Passage B discusses how astronomers attempted to predict the orbits of planets using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  Passage B argues that the predictions were not always accurate and that scientists had to hypothesize about the existence of other planets to explain the discrepancies.
Thought:
  Passage A defines a disturbing force as an auxiliary premise that can cause a prediction to fail.
  In Passage B, the auxiliary assumptions about the existence of other planets near Uranus and Mercury can be considered disturbing forces.
  Therefore, the answer is either C: Neptune or D: Mercury, since these are the planets whose orbits were being predicted by astronomers using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science.
  Popper argues that negative evidence is more powerful than positive evidence.
  Popper believes that scientific research involves generating bold theories and searching for evidence that would disprove them.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the attempts to predict its orbit.
  The astronomers' predictions were incorrect, and they hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they later discovered and named Neptune.
  Later, astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Mercury, and their predictions were also incorrect until Einstein's theory of relativity was introduced.
Thought: 
  The question asks which of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A.
  In passage A, disturbing forces are one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists use to derive a theory's predictions.
  In passage B, the astronomers made predictions about Uranus' orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  This suggests that the most likely answer is C: Neptune, which was the planet that the astronomers hypothesized was causing the disturbance in Uranus' orbit.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in passage B that Neptune was a "disturbing force" in the sense that it was an auxiliary premise used to derive predictions about Uranus' orbit.
  Rather, Neptune was hypothesized as an additional planet in the solar system that was affecting Uranus' orbit.
  It is also possible that the correct answer is not listed among the choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the power of negative evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B illustrates how astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus and later Mercury.
  A disturbing force is an auxiliary premise that can affect the functioning of instrumentation, and can lead to false predictions.
Thought: 
  The question asks which of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in Passage A.
  Passage A describes a disturbing force as an auxiliary premise that can affect the functioning of instrumentation and lead to false predictions.
  Passage B describes how astronomers used auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus and later Mercury.
  The mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets are also auxiliary assumptions used in predicting the orbit of Uranus.
  Therefore, the answer is not A: Uranus, B: the sun, C: Neptune, or E: the moon, because none of these are auxiliary premises.
  The answer is D: Mercury, because the disturbing force in this case is an unknown planet in the vicinity that could affect the orbit of Mercury.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. 
  However, it should be noted that the answer could also be A: Uranus, because the assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus was an auxiliary premise that affected the prediction of its orbit.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science, specifically the power of negative evidence and the search for evidence that would disprove theories. 
  Passage B describes the discovery of the planet Uranus and the subsequent attempts to predict its orbit using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. 
  Disturbing forces are mentioned in passage A as one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists often need to consider when deriving predictions from a theory. 
Thought: 
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force in passage B that is similar to the concept mentioned in passage A. 
  The passage describes how scientists attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, including the assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. 
  When their predictions were incorrect, they changed their assumption about the existence of other planets and hypothesized the existence of Neptune, which was later discovered. 
  This suggests that the presence of other planets in the vicinity of Uranus may have been a disturbing force that affected its orbit. 
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, including the power of negative evidence and the search for evidence that would disprove bold theories.
  Passage B provides an example of how astronomers used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus and later Mercury, and how they adjusted their assumptions based on observations.
Thought:
  According to passage A, a disturbing force is an auxiliary premise that needs to be correct for a theory's predictions to be accurate.
  In passage B, astronomers made predictions about the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about other planets.
  The discovery of Neptune in the precise place where the astronomers predicted there must be another planet suggests that the auxiliary assumption about the existence of other planets was a disturbing force.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in passage B that the auxiliary assumption about the existence of other planets was a disturbing force.
  It is possible that the auxiliary assumption was correct, and that Neptune's existence was not a result of a disturbing force, but rather an unknown factor that the astronomers did not consider.
  Therefore, the answer is not clear-cut.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, particularly the power of negative evidence.
  Passage A highlights Popper's view that the search for negative evidence is at the heart of scientific research.
  Passage A also raises a criticism of Popper's view that negative evidence is always conclusive.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the attempts to predict its orbit using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  Passage B highlights the failure of the predictions and the astronomers' search for additional explanations, including the possibility of an error in the auxiliary assumptions.
Thought:
  In Passage A, a disturbing force is described as one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists often use when deriving a theory's predictions.
  In Passage B, the astronomers' predictions of Uranus's orbit were based on auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus, which could be considered a "disturbing force" in this context.
  The astronomers later changed this assumption when they found that their predictions were incorrect and hypothesized the existence of another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Neptune.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A discusses Popper's contribution to philosophy of science and his idea that negative evidence is more powerful than positive evidence.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of Uranus and the failed prediction of its orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets to explain the failed prediction.
  The failed prediction of Mercury's orbit led to the hypothesis of another planet, Vulcan, but it was never found.
  Einstein's theory of relativity ultimately explained the observed orbit of Mercury.
Thought:
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force as described in Passage A.
  According to Passage A, a disturbing force is an auxiliary premise that can affect the correct functioning of instrumentation.
  In Passage B, the failed prediction of Uranus's orbit was based on auxiliary assumptions about the existence of other planets in the vicinity.
  The incorrect assumption that there were no planets in the vicinity of Uranus could be considered a disturbing force.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Uranus.
Criticism:
  The answer could be open to interpretation, since the term "disturbing force" is not explicitly used in Passage B.
  It is possible that other choices, such as the sun or Neptune, could also be considered disturbing forces, depending on how one interprets the term.
  However, based on the definition given in Passage A, the assumption about the existence of other planets seems to fit the description best.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.

However, the passage does not provide enough information to infer that Dostoyevsky held this view.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: The author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings (lines 38–43) primarily to
Choices:
  A: show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life
  B: support the claim that Lichtenstein's work was parodic in intent
  C: contrast Lichtenstein's approach to art with that of abstract expressionism
  D: suggest the emotions that lie at the heart of Lichtenstein's work

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case

  The principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  An individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice within this framework.
  The two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect in lowering the expected utility from criminal activity, making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that some legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to argue that increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement is an effective method of deterring deliberate crimes.
  This is most similar to answer choice D, where a judge uses evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
  Both involve using a principle or evidence from another field to support a decision or argument in law.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists discovered nuclear fission between 1934 and 1939.
  Before the discovery of nuclear fission, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  The products of neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
Thought: 
  The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were not receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission, so they did not have a clear expectation of what they were looking for. 
  Therefore, it is possible that having no particular expectation regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Choice C suggests that the physicists were not aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, which is consistent with the passage, but it is not clear how this would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Choice D suggests that more physicists concentrated on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium, but it is not clear how this would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to definitively identify the most likely answer. 
  While it is possible that having no particular expectation regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split, it is also possible that it would not have made a significant difference.

  Choice C states that physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  If physicists had been aware of the calculations indicating the possibility of splitting atoms, they would have had the right conceptual link to recognize that they were splitting uranium atoms earlier.

  Your reasoning is correct.
  The other options are not supported by the information in the passage or do not make logical sense.

  The physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939 that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the physicists compiling evidence of nuclear fission did not recognize what they were witnessing because they did not have the right conceptual link.
  Therefore, the most likely way to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split would be to provide them with the right conceptual link.
  Option A is irrelevant to the problem, as using the same research techniques would not necessarily help the physicists recognize what they were witnessing.
  Option B is also irrelevant, as the passage does not suggest that their expectations regarding the by-products hindered their ability to recognize nuclear fission.
  Option C is incorrect, as the passage mentions that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it was possible to break atoms apart, but the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result.

  The substances remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  If the physicists had conducted experiments with a substance other than uranium, it would not have been helpful in understanding that atoms were being split.
  If the physicists had been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, they would have recognized what they were witnessing earlier.
  If more physicists concentrated on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium, it may have led to more data and a faster realization that atoms were being split.
  Therefore, D: More physicists concentrated on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence to suggest that the physicists were not using the same research techniques or that they had particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  Furthermore, the theoretical calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms were already produced before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated. Therefore, it is unlikely that these calculations would have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

  The discovery of nuclear fission was a gradual process that involved multiple experiments and researchers.
  The researchers were compiling evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing what they were witnessing.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the physicists were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms and had certain expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  Therefore, if the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products (B), it would have been more likely for them to realize that atoms were being split.
  If they were aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms (C), it would have also been more likely for them to realize what they were witnessing.
  Having more physicists concentrate on obtaining experimental results (D) may have helped to speed up the discovery, but it is not as directly related to the issue at hand as options B and C.
  Conducting experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium (E) is not discussed in the passage and is not likely to have had an impact on the discovery of nuclear fission.
Criticism: 
  Although option B is a plausible answer, it is not the only possible answer. 
  It is also possible that the physicists could have realized what they were witnessing if they were aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms (option C).
  It is not clear whether having more physicists concentrate on obtaining experimental results (option D) would have had a significant impact on the discovery of nuclear fission.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists conducted experiments on neutron bombardment of uranium and compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  The physicists were not receptive to the possibility that they were splitting uranium atoms.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
Thought: 
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  However, they were not receptive to the possibility that they were splitting uranium atoms.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  Therefore, if the physicists had been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, they would have been more receptive to the possibility that they were splitting uranium atoms, and would have realized it sooner.
  The answer is C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the physicists had been using different research techniques or that more physicists would have led to a quicker realization of the splitting of atoms.
  The fact that the physicists had particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products is mentioned in the passage, and this expectation hindered their recognition of the significance of the data.
  Option E is irrelevant to the question since it is asking about what would have reduced the amount of time it took physicists to realize that atoms were being split, and not about the possibility of conducting experiments on substances other than uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Earlier, theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission.
  Researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in that context.
Thought:
  Physicists did not recognize what they were witnessing despite increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Physicists were not receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in that context.
  Therefore, if physicists had not held on to this expectation, they would have been more likely to realize that atoms were being split.
  Choice B suggests that physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  Therefore, choice B would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Physicists discovered nuclear fission between 1934 and 1939, but did not recognize what they were witnessing until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, and coined the term "nuclear fission."
Thought: 
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data and coined the term "nuclear fission."
  Therefore, it is likely that if physicists had been aware of the theoretical calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, they would have recognized what they were witnessing earlier.
  The answer is C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide any information that other choices are incorrect.
  However, it is possible that other factors could have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the theory of evolution and how it contributes to human behavior.
  The author of Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory".
  The term "conspiracy theory" implies that the author of Passage B is critical of evolutionary psychology.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B is critical of evolutionary psychology.
  The term "conspiracy theory" implies that the author of Passage B thinks that evolutionary psychology is not a legitimate scientific theory.
  The author of Passage B might think that evolutionary psychology is not a legitimate scientific theory because it imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
  Therefore, the assertion from Passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and its explanation for human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing an interest (proliferation of genes) to human behavior that the agent may not be aware of.
Thought: 
  The author of passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for explaining behavior in terms of a hidden interest (proliferation of genes) that people may not be aware of.
  The assertion in passage A that most closely exemplifies this criticism is that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This is because this assertion suggests that there is a hidden interest (self-propagation of genes) behind seemingly unselfish behavior.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and its approach to examining human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology and compares it to a conspiracy theory.
Thought: 
  The author of passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology by stating that it is like a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
  The assertion from passage A that best exemplifies this is that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This assertion suggests that individuals are not consciously aware that their actions are promoting their genes' self-propagation.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the theory of evolution and how it relates to human behavior.
  Evolutionary psychology seeks to explain human behavior through the lens of evolution.
  The problem of altruism is difficult for evolutionary psychology to explain.
  Identification and empathy may have evolved to promote the welfare of related individuals.
  Genes may promote their self-propagation through seemingly unselfish actions.
Thought: 
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for explaining behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not acknowledge or is not aware of.
  The assertion that genes may promote their self-propagation through seemingly unselfish actions exemplifies this criticism.
  The author of passage B would likely argue that evolutionary psychology is a "conspiracy theory" because it posits a hidden agenda (gene proliferation) that explains behavior.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses the theory of evolution and how it applies to human behavior, particularly altruism.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing interests to human behavior that the agent of the behavior may not be aware of.
Thought: 
  The author of passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is a "conspiracy theory" because it imputes interests to human behavior that may not be accurate or reasonable.
  The assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies this is the idea that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This is an example of evolutionary psychology imputing an interest (gene propagation) to behavior (altruism) that the agent of the behavior may not be aware of or may not be doing solely for that reason.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. 
  However, it is worth noting that while passage B does criticize evolutionary psychology for imputing interests to human behavior, it is not necessarily saying that this is always a bad thing or that evolutionary psychology is entirely wrong.
  Instead, it is cautioning against making hasty inferences and emphasizing the importance of considering alternative explanations for behavior.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and how it explains human behavior from an evolutionary standpoint.
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory that imputes interests to individuals that they may not be aware of.
Thought:
  The author of passage B is critical of evolutionary psychology for imputing interests to individuals that they may not be aware of.
  The explanation in passage A that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish exemplifies this idea.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism:
  Your analysis is correct. The author of passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing interests to individuals that they may not be aware of, and the example in passage A of genes promoting their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish exemplifies this idea.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A explains the theory of evolutionary psychology and its application to human behavior.
  The author of Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory that imputes hidden motives to human behavior.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for explaining human behavior by imputing hidden motives to individuals that they are not aware of.
  The assertion from Passage A that most clearly exemplifies this is that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This is because it suggests that human behavior may be unconsciously motivated by the desire to propagate one's genes, even if the individual is not aware of this motive.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism: 
  Your reasoning is correct in that the assertion in Passage A that genes may promote their self-propagation through apparently unselfish actions exemplifies the author of Passage B's criticism of evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory.
  However, it is important to note that the author of Passage B is not necessarily correct in their criticism of evolutionary psychology.
  Some may argue that the theory of evolution can provide a useful framework for understanding human behavior, even if not all behavior can be explained solely by evolutionary motives.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A discusses evolutionary psychology and how it explains human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution.

  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" that imputes interests to agents of behavior.
Thought:
  The author of Passage B is critical of evolutionary psychology because it attributes hidden interests to human behavior.
  The assertion from Passage A that best exemplifies this is the idea that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This assertion suggests that human behavior that appears altruistic is actually motivated by the desire to propagate genes, which is an interest that individuals may not acknowledge or even be aware of.
  This is an example of an interest being imputed to the agent of behavior.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Criticism:
  This thought process is correct.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how most scholars have focused on "as-told-to" life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators, which emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." 
  The passage also discusses how these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the collaborative process in which non-Native American collaborators solicited, translated, recorded, and edited the as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
  The phrase suggests that the finished product is a composite of two cultures: that of the Native American narrator and that of the non-Native American collaborator.
  Therefore, the answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The answer is not A because the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" in line 5 does not suggest that the finished product is based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture, but rather that it is a collaboration between two different cultures.
  The answer is not C because the phrase does not suggest that the identities of the writers cannot be determined.
  The answer is not D because the phrase does not suggest that the original writer was from one culture and the editor was from another culture.
  The answer is not E because the phrase does not suggest that the finished product is based on oral communication by a member of another culture. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:

  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the type of life histories that most scholars have focused on.
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the type of life histories that most scholars have focused on.
  The phrase suggests that the life histories were created collaboratively by individuals from two different cultures.
  The phrase implies that the final product is a composite of the contributions of the two cultures.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Criticism: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers specifically to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The collaborators are not necessarily individuals who belong to a culture other than Native American, but rather individuals who are not Native American.
  The phrase does not suggest that the contributors from the two cultures contributed in the same way to the finished product.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how scholars have focused on written autobiographies of Native Americans that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. 
  The passage mentions that these autobiographies emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that the written autobiographies of Native Americans were created through collaboration between members of two different cultures: Native American and non-Native American. 
  The phrase suggests that the final product is a combination of the contributions of both cultures.
  Option B is incorrect because it suggests that there are only two authors, each from a different culture, who contribute equally to the finished product. 
  Option C is incorrect because it suggests that the identities of the authors cannot be determined. 
  Option D is incorrect because it suggests that the original author is from one culture and the editor is from another culture. There may be more than one editor.
  Option E is incorrect because it suggests that the written autobiography is based solely on oral communication from a member of another culture, rather than a collaboration between members of two cultures.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")

  The resulting work is a composite of both cultures, with the non-Native American collaborators playing a significant role in the creation of the final product.
  The term "composite" suggests that the work is made up of multiple parts, and "bicultural" indicates that these parts come from two different cultures.
  Therefore, the most accurate meaning of the phrase is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.
  B: It serves as the author's logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.
  C: It forms part of a speculative hypothesis that the author presents for its interest in relation to the main topic rather than as part of an argument.
  D: It serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.
  E: It forms part of the author's concession that certain factors complicate the argument presented in the first two paragraphs.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy
  D: conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives
  E: eagerness to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).

- The subtractive method is used in FMRI to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with a cognitive task.
Thought:
- The passage suggests that the subtractive method is problematic because it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
- The passage also suggests that the modular theory of mind may not be accurate, as mental processes may not be decomposable into independent modules.
- The passage does not explicitly state that the empirical results derived using the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications, that the subtractive method supports Uttal's view, or that the subtractive method disproves the idea of emotions being seated in the amygdala.
- The passage does suggest, however, that the subtractive method creates an illusion of neat functional localization, which may support the modular theory of mind.
- The passage does not suggest that there is a fundamental misconception of the subtractive method.
- Based on the passage, the author would most likely agree with choice D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Criticism:
- The passage does not explicitly state that the subtractive method creates an illusion of localization to support the modular theory of mind. This is an interpretation that can be drawn from the passage, but it is not explicitly stated.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology research.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise that the validity of neuroimaging in psychology research depends on.
  FMRI brain scans use a subtractive method to highlight the metabolic activity associated with a specific cognitive task.
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and how it is used in neuroimaging research. It explains that the modular theory of mind may not be accurate and that the entire brain is active during both control and cognitive task conditions. However, the subtractive method used in FMRI brain scans can still produce images of the brain at work. The most strongly supported statement by the passage is that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. This is supported by the discussion of the subtractive method used in FMRI brain scans and how it works to highlight the metabolic activity associated with a specific cognitive task.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and has long been considered reliable, while acknowledging that further testing and development of consistent standards may be desirable. It also suggests that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification, regularly tested and subject to proficiency requirements, and that the trial court was within its discretion in crediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match," and there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. It suggests that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. It also cites a more rigorous test that showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B have different perspectives on the reliability and consistency of fingerprint identification and the standards and error rates associated with it.
  A: Both passages suggest that fingerprint examiners are subject to testing and proficiency requirements, and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. Therefore, there is no disagreement on whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable.
  B: Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate, while Passage B suggests that the error rate has received little systematic study and cites a more rigorous test that showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification. Therefore, there is a disagreement on the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
  C: Passage A acknowledges that fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, while Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." Therefore, there is no disagreement on whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law.
  D: Passage A suggests that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification, while Passage B suggests that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match and that some examiners reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Therefore, there is a disagreement on the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification.
  E: Passage A suggests that different agencies may require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, while Passage B argues that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match.

  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and that experts have long concurred about its reliability. It argues that while further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, there is no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. 
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match and that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. It argues that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study and that some proficiency tests have been criticized as lax.
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification as evidence.
  Therefore, the answer is C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law.
Criticism:
  None.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint evidence has been used in criminal trials for a long time and has been found to be reliable.

  Passage A and Passage B disagree on the reliability of fingerprint evidence.
  Passage A argues that fingerprint evidence is reliable and has been used in criminal trials for a long time.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the reliability of fingerprint evidence.
  The answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the authors disagree on the reliability of fingerprint evidence, but the question is asking specifically about their disagreement on the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case. 
  Passage A argues that fingerprint evidence has an exceedingly low error rate and that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. 
  Passage B argues that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study and that a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
  Therefore, the answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. The fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. There is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. A more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and experts have long concurred about its reliability. It acknowledges that further testing and development of consistent standards may be desirable, but sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has withstood the test of time. It also argues that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification, and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The court in Passage A believes that the trial court below was within its discretion in crediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate.
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." It asserts that some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. It also argues that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Passage B also states that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, and argues that the answers to questions about the likelihood of two people sharing a certain number of identifying characteristics are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence.
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B seem to disagree about whether fingerprint examiners have uniform, objective standards for identifying fingerprints. Passage A argues that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review, while Passage B argues that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification and that local practices vary. Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate, while Passage B argues that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study and that some proficiency tests have been criticized as lax.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The best works of art improve with age.
  E: Some forms of art are superior to others.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between perfume-making and painting, and argues that great perfume is undervalued in the art world.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that perfume-making is a form of art that is similar to painting, and that it can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  The passage also suggests that great perfume is undervalued because it is often made and distributed by large corporations that prioritize profits over quality.
  However, the passage does not provide support for the claim that some forms of art are superior to others, or that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for commercial success.
  The passage also does not provide support for the claim that the best works of art improve with age, as it only discusses how the appearance of oil paintings changes over time.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfume-making.
  Painters combine pigments with media to create color, while perfumers combine olfactory elements to create scents.

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between the art of painting and the art of perfumery.
  The author argues that perfumery is just as worthy of serious consideration as painting.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that perfumery is a legitimate art form, and one that is similar to painting in many ways.
  The author argues that perfumery is undervalued because it is often made and distributed by large corporations more interested in profit than in quality.
  The passage does not make any claims about the superiority of one art form over another, or about the inevitability of artistic failure.
  However, the passage does suggest that a work of art (in this case, a perfume) can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage compares the art of painting and the art of perfumery. 
  The painter combines pigments with media such as oils and resins to create a painting, while the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds to create a perfume. 
  The appearance of a painting changes over time because oil paint becomes more transparent. 
  Similarly, perfumes change and develop over time as the scent evaporates at different rates. 
  The passage also mentions that fine perfume is often undervalued because it is made and distributed by large corporations that substitute cheaper ingredients for rarer, better ones.
Thought: 
  The passage compares the art of painting and the art of perfumery, and notes similarities in the way artists and perfumers combine elements to create a work of art.
  The passage also notes that fine perfume is often undervalued because of corporate greed.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings
Response 0:

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions, a new class of protein pathogen that lacks nucleic acid and can reproduce itself without genetic material.
  Prions can convert normal proteins into abnormal, pathogenic ones and cause degenerative neurological conditions such as CJD, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is that the discovery of prions challenges the traditional view of pathogens and has important implications for understanding and treating degenerative neurological conditions.
  Choice A is incorrect because it focuses on the mechanism of protein reproduction, which is not the main point of the passage.
  Choice B accurately expresses the main point of the passage by highlighting the discovery of prions and their unique ability to reproduce themselves without genetic material, which is the central topic of the passage.
  Choice C is incorrect because it goes beyond the scope of the passage by suggesting that prions may be responsible for most degenerative neurological conditions, which is not supported by the evidence presented.
  Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the skepticism surrounding the discovery of prions, which is not the main point of the passage.
  Choice E accurately expresses the main point of the passage by emphasizing that prions, despite lacking genetic material, are capable of reproducing themselves, which challenges traditional views of pathogens.
Criticism: 
  Choice B accurately expresses the main point of the passage, but it could be more specific by mentioning the implications of this discovery for understanding and treating degenerative neurological conditions.
  Choice E is also accurate, but it does not fully capture the significance of the discovery of prions for the field of pathology.

Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen, and their link to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  Prions lack nucleic acid, reproduce themselves, and cause cellular destruction in the brain.
  CJD is inevitably fatal and there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is to explain the discovery of prions, which are a new type of protein pathogen that causes CJD and other degenerative neurological diseases.
  Prions lack nucleic acid and reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that converts normally shaped prions into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  CJD is inevitably fatal and there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
  Answer B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material, best summarizes the main point of the passage.
Criticism: 
  It is not accurate to say that prions are uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material, as there are other pathogens that lack genetic material and reproduce themselves, such as viruses.
  The passage does not suggest that prions are responsible for most other degenerative neurological conditions, so answer C is not accurate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is about the discovery of prions, a new class of infectious pathogens, and their link to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.

Furthermore, prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, and the body does not produce an immune response to them. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. 
  The other answer choices are incorrect because they either do not accurately capture the main point of the passage or they include information that is not discussed in the passage.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 85 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 86 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

The passage also mentions that the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials hampered precise chemical analyses. 
  Therefore, the physics community during the 1930s did not recognize nuclear fission as a possibility and did not identify the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium. They also faced difficulties in conducting precise chemical analyses due to the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  The answer is C: It never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide information to support the statement that the physics community during the 1930s never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.

  The passage mentions several pieces of evidence that were present but not recognized by the researchers, including the puzzling radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium and the clear chemical evidence that barium was being produced.
  However, the author specifically refers to "the relevant evidence" as something that had been present for some time but was lacking the right conceptual link.
  The results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 may be the most nearly equivalent to "the relevant evidence," but this is not explicitly stated in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The author notes that scientists had been compiling evidence of nuclear fission before the concept was fully understood.
  The "relevant evidence" is mentioned in line 62 and is likely related to the discovery of nuclear fission.
Thought:
  The "relevant evidence" is likely the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission through neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The "relevant evidence" is mentioned in relation to the evidence being present for some time, but lacking the right conceptual link.
  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" is likely the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism:
  The passage does mention the discovery of nuclear fission through neutron bombardment of uranium, but it also mentions the importance of Meitner's theoretical work in recognizing the significance of the data.
  The "relevant evidence" could be interpreted as referring to the specific evidence that led to Meitner's recognition of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, the answer could also be B: the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission and the evidence that led to its recognition. 
  The evidence was present for some time, but the right conceptual link was lacking.
Thought:
  The relevant evidence that was present for some time, but not recognized, must be the evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  This evidence is described as being present between 1934 and 1939, which matches choice A.
  The other choices mention evidence that was discovered later or that is not directly related to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, the answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism:
  There is no significant flaw in the logic used to arrive at the answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission and how scientists had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939.
  The author argues that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms, but they lacked the right conceptual link.
Thought: 
  The relevant evidence is what the researchers had been witnessing, but failed to recognize.
  The author argues that this evidence had been present for some time.
  The evidence must be related to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The evidence must be something that the researchers had observed, but did not fully understand.
  Option A describes the experiments conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939. This is not what the author means by "the relevant evidence."
  Option B describes the experiments conducted by Meitner in 1938. This is not what the author means by "the relevant evidence."
  Option C describes the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. This evidence is related to the discovery of nuclear fission and the researchers' failure to recognize what they were witnessing. This is a possible answer.
  Option D describes a fact that helped researchers confirm the discovery of nuclear fission. This is not what the author means by "the relevant evidence."
  Option E describes a consequence of the researchers' failure to recognize the evidence. This is not what the author means by "the relevant evidence."
Criticism: 
  Option C is a possible answer, but it is not clearly the best answer.
  The passage describes multiple pieces of evidence that the researchers had observed, but did not fully understand. It is not clear which piece of evidence the author means by "the relevant evidence."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The author discusses the discovery of nuclear fission in the 1930s.
  The researchers had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  The "relevant evidence" is mentioned in line 62.
Thought: 
  The "relevant evidence" is what the researchers had been witnessing but had not recognized as nuclear fission.
  The author mentions that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking only the right conceptual link.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence must be something that the researchers had observed but not understood.
  The results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 are mentioned as evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but not recognized.
  The fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus is mentioned as evidence that Meitner recognized as significant.
  The clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium is also mentioned as evidence.
  The fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long is also mentioned as a hindrance to identifying the relevant evidence.
  Based on the context, the most likely answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Criticism: 
  The author mentions that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking only the right conceptual link.
  While the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 are mentioned as evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, it is not clear that this is the "relevant evidence" referred to in line 62.
  The fact that Meitner recognized the significance of the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium is also a strong possibility.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the work of Roy Lichtenstein, a painter who helped define pop art.
  Lichtenstein's work incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings, and he often used comic book panels as a reference point.
  Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it.
  Lichtenstein's work exuded a deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists.
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and exuding a deliberate naivete.
  To challenge this characterization, we need to find a statement that contradicts these claims.
  (A) does not contradict the characterization, as attending exhibitions does not necessarily mean agreement with the style.
  (B) does not contradict the characterization, as praising one emotional painting does not mean Lichtenstein was not rebelling against the overall emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  (C) does not contradict the characterization, as praising early abstract expressionists does not mean Lichtenstein was not rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  (D) does not contradict the characterization, as criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings does not mean Lichtenstein was not exuding a deliberate naivete.
  (E) contradicts the characterization, as criticizing a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion suggests Lichtenstein did not believe in deliberate naivete as a response to the excess of sophistication.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion. 
Criticism: 
  The answer and thought process are correct. 
  None of the other options would contradict the characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Roy Lichtenstein and his work as a pop artist.
  Lichtenstein's work incorporated comic book styles into fine art, and was a reaction against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  His work displayed an impulse toward realism and a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in some other pop artists.
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a deliberate merging of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art that generates a complex result.
  His work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it.
  Lichtenstein's work exuded a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in some other pop artists.
  Therefore, any option that suggests that Lichtenstein was not rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, or that he was not deliberately merging a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art, or that he did not exude a kind of deliberate naivete, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Analysis: 
  A: The fact that Lichtenstein attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s does not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as a reaction against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, or as a deliberate merging of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art, or as exuding a kind of deliberate naivete. Therefore, this option is not the best answer.
  B: The fact that Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting does not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as a reaction against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, or as a deliberate merging of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art, or as exuding a kind of deliberate naivete. Therefore, this option is not the best answer.
  C: The fact that Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings does not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as a reaction against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, or as a deliberate merging of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art, or as exuding a kind of deliberate naivete. Therefore, this option is not the best answer.
  D: The fact that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings does not necessarily contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as a reaction against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, or as a deliberate merging of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art, or as exuding a kind of deliberate naivete. Therefore, this option is not the best answer.
  E: The fact that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion does contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as exuding a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in some other pop artists. If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion, it suggests that he did not share the same view as the pop artist that emotion was not necessary in art. Therefore, this option is the best answer.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation

  The paragraph doesn't distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum, outline the constitution itself, or give evidence of wampum's effectiveness in ensuring compliance with the law.
  Therefore, the answer is C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the last paragraph describes how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum and how they were used to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution using a symbolic system.
  However, it also serves to give evidence of wampum's effectiveness in ensuring compliance with the law of the Haudenosaune Confederacy, as it states that the wampum symbol system served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law can be counterproductive and that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines investor confidence and can ultimately destroy the market.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible, including insider information.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines investor confidence and can ultimately destroy the market.
  The law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would be one that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  This would allow for the spread of all relevant information, including analysis, while still prohibiting the use of insider information.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible, and insider trading should be permitted as long as the information is not obtained through special position or theft.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines market transparency and investor confidence, which could ultimately destroy the market.
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading can be beneficial for the stock market, as it helps spread accurate information about a company's value, and insider nontrading is a widespread practice that should not be criminalized. 
  Therefore, the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Choice B most closely aligns with this position.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should be reconsidered because they interfere with the functioning of the stock market and the spread of information. The author believes that insider-trading laws should not prevent people from acting on information that is not widely known, but rather should target those who use their position within a company to gain an unfair advantage.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading is unfair because it gives some people an unfair advantage in the stock market, which undermines the principle of transparency and could ultimately destroy the market. The author believes that insider-trading laws should prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
Thought: 
  The author of Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should not prevent people from acting on information that is not widely known, but rather should target those who use their position within a company to gain an unfair advantage. Therefore, the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of Passage A but not that articulated by the author of Passage B is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism: 
  While the author of Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should not prevent people from acting on information that is not widely known, the author does not specifically endorse a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock. Additionally, the author of Passage B argues that insider-trading laws should prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, but does not necessarily argue against a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock. Therefore, the distinction between the two passages is not as clear cut as presented in the question.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should allow people to trade based on information that everyone else doesn't have, but not based on information obtained because of their special position within a company.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading law should prohibit trading based on any information that everyone else doesn't have.
Thought:
  The author of passage A believes that insider trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have is necessary for a functioning stock market. However, trading based on information obtained through one's position within a company is unfair and should be illegal.
  None of the choices allows trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have while prohibiting trading based on information obtained through one's position within a company.
  Choice A prohibits trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have, which is against the author of passage A's argument.
  Choice B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock, but passage A does not make a distinction based on how the information is obtained. Therefore, choice B is not the correct answer.
  Choice C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is not directly related to the author of passage A's argument.
  Choice D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising. This distinction is not made in passage A, and therefore, it is not the correct answer.
  Choice E legalizes trading based on inside information, which is against the author of passage B's argument.
  None of the choices conforms closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
Criticism:
  None
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should allow people to act on accurate information about changing circumstances so that stock prices reflect them. It also argues that insider nontrading is a widespread practice that is similar to insider trading but is not punished. 
  Passage B argues that insider trading compromises the market and undermines investor confidence. It suggests that transparency is necessary for a fair and successful stock market.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should allow people to act on accurate information about changing circumstances so that stock prices reflect them. It also argues that insider nontrading is a widespread practice that is similar to insider trading but is not punished. 
  Choice A would prevent people from trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which would be more restrictive than the position articulated by passage A. 
  Choice B would be consistent with the position articulated by passage A because it would permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
  Choice C would be more restrictive than the position articulated by passage A because it would prohibit trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which could include some actions that passage A would permit. 
  Choice D would be more restrictive than the position articulated by passage A because it would only permit selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping and prohibit buying based on inside information that it should be rising. 
  Choice E would be more permissive than the position articulated by passage A because it would legalize trading based on inside information, while passage A argues that insider-trading law should prohibit some forms of insider trading. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading law should permit trading based on information that is not exclusive to the individual, but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the market and causes a loss of investor confidence.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that it is not fair to prohibit trading based on information that is not exclusive to the individual and that such trading helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. 
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the market and causes a loss of investor confidence, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market.
  A law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would permit trading based on information that is not exclusive to the individual, but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Criticism: 
  The passage A suggests that trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have is part of the functioning stock market. However, passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the market and causes a loss of investor confidence.
  While passage A argues that insider trading law should permit trading based on information that is not exclusive to the individual, it does not suggest that trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company should be prohibited.
  Therefore, the answer could also be "None of the Above" as none of the options precisely conforms to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
Action: Answer("B") or Answer("E")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit people to act on accurate information about changing circumstances, as it helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts, and that insider nontrading is a far more widespread practice that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge, and is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading unfairly compromises the stock market and undermines investor confidence, as people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit people to act on accurate information about changing circumstances, as it helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. 
  Choice A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which would undermine the argument of Passage A that people with accurate information about changing circumstances should be permitted to act to ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Choice B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is consistent with the argument of Passage A that someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. 
  Choice C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is consistent with the argument of Passage B that insider-trading undermines investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market, but not with the argument of Passage A that insider-trading law should permit people to act on accurate information about changing circumstances to ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Choice D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is inconsistent with the argument of Passage A that someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping.
  Choice E legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means, which is inconsistent with the argument of Passage B that insider-trading unfairly compromises the stock market and undermines investor confidence.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Criticism: 
  None.
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have.
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit selling a stock because of inside knowledge that the stock's price will drop.
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading situations unfairly compromises the stock market.
  Passage B argues that transparency is one of the basic principles of the stock market.
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have.
  Option A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
  Option B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Option C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market.
  Option D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising.
  Option E legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means.
  Option B is the closest to the position articulated by the author of passage A because it permits trading based on analysis of a stock, which is similar to what the author argues, and prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is what insider-trading law does. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have, as it is part of the functioning of the stock market, but prohibit trading based on information gained because of one's position within a company. The author suggests that insider-trading law should not undermine the transparency of the stock market, and should allow accurate information to be spread as widely as possible.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading law should prohibit trading based on information that other people don't have, as it compromises the transparency of the stock market and undermines investor confidence.
Thought: 
  The law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A would be one that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This is because the author of passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have, as it is part of the functioning of the stock market, but prohibit trading based on information gained because of one's position within a company. The author suggests that insider-trading law should not undermine the transparency of the stock market, and should allow accurate information to be spread as widely as possible. This law would permit people to use their own analysis and evaluation of a company's value to make trading decisions, but would prevent those with inside knowledge gained from their position within a company from using that knowledge to gain an unfair advantage.
  Answer(B)
Criticism: 
  The author of passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have, but the law suggested in option B would prohibit trading based on information gained from one's position within a company, which would not be permitted under the author's argument. Option B would only permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock, which may be information that is already widely available, rather than information gained from a person's position within a company, which could be more valuable and not available to the general public.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should permit trading based on information that everyone doesn't have, but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading is unfair and undermines investor confidence in the stock market, and thus a law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A would not permit insider-trading.
Thought:
  The author of Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should permit trading based on information that everyone doesn't have, but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company because it helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts and is good for everyone in the stock market.
  The author of Passage B argues that insider-trading is unfair and undermines investor confidence in the stock market, and thus a law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A would not permit insider-trading.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is C, a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage talks about two theories on how neurons communicate with each other: the electrical impulses theory and the chemical theory.
  The electrical impulses theory posits that communication between neurons is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses.
  The chemical theory posits that the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron.

Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the two alternative theories about how communication between neurons takes place in the brain. 
  The first theory suggests that communication between neurons is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons).
  The second theory suggests that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically through the release of neurotransmitters.
  The second theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, and recent research has provided evidence of the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions.

Knowledge:
  The passage talks about the two theories that explain the communication between neurons: electrical and chemical.
  The electrical theory suggests that impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses.
  The chemical theory suggests that neurotransmitters are secreted by the excited neuron which binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron and renders the neuron permeable to ions, generating an electrical impulse that runs through the cell.
  The new evidence suggests that the structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.

Knowledge:
  Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals.
  Communication between neurons is made possible through synapses and electrical impulses.
  As early as 1904, some neurobiologists speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically.
  The alternative theory suggests that the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron.

  Receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.

  The passage does not provide any evidence to support answer choices A, B, D, or E.
  While the passage does not explicitly state that prions would not cause CJD if they were unable to reproduce themselves, this idea is strongly suggested by the passage's description of the process by which prions cause disease.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans caused by a new type of protein pathogen called prions.
  The prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
Thought: 
  The passage provides information about the characteristics of prions and their relationship to CJD. 
  It does not suggest that CJD can only be transmitted through the injection of abnormally shaped prions, so A is incorrect.
  The passage does not suggest that most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions, so B is incorrect.
  The passage states that abnormally shaped prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction, so C is correct.
  The passage suggests that Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may be caused by a similar process of protein malformation, but it does not suggest that they are caused by the same prion pathogen that causes CJD, so D is incorrect.
  The passage does not provide information about the relative aggressiveness of prion diseases compared to diseases caused by other known pathogens, so E is incorrect.
Criticism: 
  The thought process and answer are correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called a prion.
  Prions cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  CJD is inevitably fatal and is caused by abnormally shaped prions that reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
Thought: 
  The passage provides extensive information about prions and their role in causing CJD.
  The passage does not support option A, as it does not mention the transmission of CJD through injection or any other means.
  The passage does not support option B, as it only discusses prions in relation to CJD and mentions that other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may be caused by a similar process of protein malformation.
  The passage supports option C, as it states that abnormally shaped prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  The passage does not support option D, as it only mentions that other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may be caused by a similar process of protein malformation, but it does not suggest that they are caused by the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  The passage does not support option E, as it does not provide any information about how prion diseases progress compared to diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not provide enough information to support options A, B, D, or E.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called prions, which lacks nucleic acid and reproduces by inducing normally shaped prions to transform into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. 
  Prions exist naturally in the body as proteins, and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  CJD is caused by abnormally shaped prions that reproduce themselves in a cascade process, ultimately destroying nerve cells in the brain.
  The passage suggests that prions may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
Thought:
  CJD is caused by abnormally shaped prions that reproduce themselves in a cascade process.
  If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  Therefore, the ability of prions to reproduce themselves is necessary for them to cause CJD.
  The answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Criticism:
  The passage does not provide any information to support answer choice A.
  The passage does not suggest that most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions, so answer choice B is not supported.
  Answer choice D is incorrect because the passage only suggests that prions may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions, not that they are the same pathogen that causes CJD.
  The passage does not provide information to support answer choice E.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
The main point of the passage is that the concept of increasing returns to scale, exemplified by the Pin Factory, has been historically neglected in economic theory due to its difficulty to represent mathematically. The passage explains how this concept contradicts the idea of the Invisible Hand and how it challenges the assumption of diminishing returns, which dominated economic theory for almost two centuries. Only recently have economists found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable. Therefore, the best answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The article discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory refers to the idea that increasing returns to scale can lead to natural monopolies, while the Invisible Hand assumes many competitors in each industry.
  For a long time, economists focused on diminishing returns, which are easier to model mathematically.
  Recently, however, increasing returns have gained more attention thanks to new mathematical models.

  The article does not compare the rigor of the models for the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, so C is incorrect.
  While the article does discuss Adam Smith's contribution to economic theory, it does not state that he was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good, so D is incorrect.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory since Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations in 1776. 
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the efficiency of increased size and specialization, which leads to increasing returns to scale. 
  The Invisible Hand refers to the idea that self-interest can be harnessed to the common good in a market economy. 
  The two concepts are opposed to each other because increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which is opposed to the idea of many competitors in each industry for the Invisible Hand to work properly. 
  Until the late 1970s, economists failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries, including railroads, because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades
Response 0:
The main point of the passage is that earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants. Therefore, the correct answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by increased labor demand in the North due to World War I, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and recruitment efforts by Northern employers.
  Once the Great Migration began, it developed momentum over time due to the reduction of the difficulties and costs of migration by earlier migrants helping later migrants.
Thought: 
  The passage presents several factors that contributed to the Great Migration.
  The Great Migration began in 1915 due to increased labor demand in the North, reduced labor demand in the South, and recruitment efforts by Northern employers.
  Once the Great Migration began, it developed momentum over time due to the reduction of the difficulties and costs of migration by earlier migrants helping later migrants.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that earlier migrants helped reduce the difficulties and costs of migration for later migrants during the Great Migration.
  Choice D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants, accurately expresses the main point of the passage.
Criticism: 
  Choice A is incorrect because it only provides a general overview of the Great Migration without focusing on the main point of the passage.
  Choice B is incorrect because it only discusses the triggers of the Great Migration without focusing on the main point of the passage.
  Choice C is incorrect because it only discusses the financial costs of migration without mentioning the cultural and linguistic cushion provided by earlier migrants.
  Choice E is incorrect because it only discusses the duration of the Great Migration without focusing on the main point of the passage.

  Answer: D
Criticism: 
  While the passage does discuss the various factors that triggered the Great Migration, including increased labor demand in the North due to World War I, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and recruitment efforts by Northern employers, those are not the main point of the passage.
  The passage emphasizes the role of momentum in the continuation and acceleration of the Great Migration, as well as the ways in which earlier migrants reduced the difficulties and costs of migration for later migrants.
  Therefore, answer D is the best choice as it most accurately expresses the main point of the passage.

  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the Northern industrial cities between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was triggered by three main factors: increased labor demand in the North due to World War I, reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation, and Northern employers sending labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South.
  Once the Great Migration began, it developed momentum over time as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration.
  This was due to several factors, including the passing of information about labor- and housing-market conditions, earlier migrants reducing the physical costs of moving, providing a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants, and helping to defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company.
  Trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have is part of the definition of a functioning stock market; however, insider trading is not allowed.
  Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.

  Therefore, both authors would be most likely to agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Criticism:
  There is no evidence in the passages that the authors would agree that all information should be available to all market participants at the same time, so B is not the best answer.
  While Passage A argues that it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage through stock analysis, it does not argue that this is always appropriate or that insider trading is acceptable, so C is not the best answer.
  Passage A argues that insider nontrading should not be regulated to the same extent as insider trading, so D is not the best answer.
  Passage A argues that insider trading can help disseminate information, but it does not argue that insider trading is the best means for disseminating information, so E is not the best answer.

  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence in the stock market and denies companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful.
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A would argue that insider trading is not necessarily a bad thing, as it helps ensure that stock prices reflect accurate assessments of all relevant facts.

  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the stock market and investor confidence, which can ultimately harm companies and the wider economy. 
Thought: 
  The authors of both passages seem to agree that insider trading, which involves using non-public information to make stock transactions, is harmful to the stock market. 
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws may hinder the flow of information in the stock market, but it does not necessarily endorse insider trading. 
  Passage B argues that transparency is a fundamental principle of the stock market, and insider trading undermines this principle and investor confidence.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915
  D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain
  E: suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was caused by a combination of factors, including increased labor demand in the North during World War I, recruitment of African American labor by Northern employers, and a boll weevil infestation that reduced labor demand in the South.
  The difficulties and costs of migration include uncertainty about housing and labor-market conditions in the destination, the physical cost of moving, and the need to adapt to a new culture and language.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with their new surroundings.
  This sentence seems to be providing additional information about the difficulties and costs of migration, specifically the need to adapt to a new culture and language.
  The purpose of this sentence may be to explain why later migrants found it easier to adapt to their new surroundings than earlier migrants did.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
  The answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  Your analysis is correct. There is no indication in the passage that the purpose of the sentence is to challenge traditional views or to suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915 and 1960. 
  The Great Migration was initially caused by labor demand in the industrial North, recruitment efforts by Northern employers, and a boll weevil infestation in the South. 
  Once the Great Migration began, it continued and even accelerated due to the development of momentum over time. 
  Migration was facilitated by the passing of information through letters and conversation, as well as the provision of temporary housing, food, and credit by previous migrants.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then-new surroundings.
  The sentence does not contradict any of the previous information about the causes of the Great Migration, nor does it introduce a new fact that needs to be explained.
  Instead, the sentence provides further explanation for why the Great Migration continued and accelerated over time, by highlighting the role of previous migrants in facilitating the migration of later migrants.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
  The answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  There is no indication in the passage that the authors are challenging traditional views about Northern and Southern wages, so option C is incorrect.
  Likewise, there is no evidence that the authors believe previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided, so option A is incorrect.
  Option B is partially correct in that the authors are extending their explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events, but this is not the primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph.
  Option E is incorrect because the passage provides a detailed explanation of the causes and continuation of the Great Migration.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration began in 1915 due to the increased labor demand in the industrial North, labor agents recruiting African American labor in the South, and the boll weevil infestation.
  The passage suggests that once the migration started, it developed momentum over time due to reduced difficulty and cost of future migration.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph begins with "Additionally" indicating that it is providing additional information to support the idea that the Great Migration developed momentum over time. 
  The sentence explains how previous migrants provided support to new migrants, which reduced the cost of adapting to a new locale and culture.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
  The answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to support the other answer choices.
  A: The passage does not suggest that previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided.
  B: The passage has already explained the causes of the Great Migration, so this answer choice is not correct.
  C: The passage does not challenge the view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915.

Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915 and 1960.

Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the industrial cities of the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The Great Migration was caused by a combination of factors, including increased labor demand in the North during World War I, labor agents recruiting in the South, and a boll weevil infestation reducing labor demand in the South.
  The passage suggests that once started, migration developed momentum over time as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then-new surroundings.
  The sentence is explaining how the Great Migration continued and even accelerated in subsequent decades, despite narrowing income differences between the North and South.
  Therefore, the purpose of the sentence is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
  The answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  Your answer is correct. The last sentence of the second paragraph presents a fact about the Great Migration, specifically, that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants. The authors then go on to explain how this fact contributed to the continuation and acceleration of the Great Migration over time.

Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the North between 1915 and 1960.
  The primary catalysts of the Great Migration were World War I, labor demand in the industrial North, and a boll weevil infestation that reduced labor demand in the South.
  The passage suggests that once migration started, it developed momentum over time as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration.
  Information about labor- and housing-market conditions was passed through letters and conversation, and previous migrants often provided temporary housing, food, and credit to new migrants.
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states that previous migrants provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then-new surroundings.
  This suggests that the authors are providing a fact about the Great Migration that they seek to explain.
  The fact they are explaining is how previous migrants helped to reduce the cost of adapting to a new locale and culture for later migrants.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
  The answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Criticism: 
  There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the authors are challenging the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915, so C is incorrect.
  While the authors do extend their explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events, this is not the primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph, so B is incorrect.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately characterizes the relationship between the two passages?
Choices:
  A: Passage A offers a critique of a power possessed by juries, while passage B argues in support of that power.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and are not required for growth and proper functioning.
  Therefore, the relationship between primary substances and secondary substances is analogous to the relationship between necessary and optional components in a system.
  Option B describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run, while features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  Similarly, primary substances are necessary for plants to grow and function, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive taste and smell, but plants can grow without them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinating insects to blossoms.
  Other secondary substances are biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects.
Thought: 
  Primary and secondary substances are both chemical components of plants.
  Primary substances are essential for growth and functioning, while secondary substances are not essential.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Therefore, the relationship between primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to the relationship between mechanical components (essential for functioning) and features (not essential but give a distinctive look) in automobiles.
  Answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between primary and secondary substances in plants and mechanical components and features in automobiles is not perfect.
  While both involve essential and non-essential components, the primary substances in plants are required for growth and proper functioning, while the features of an automobile are not required for it to run.
  A better analogy may be the relationship between essential and non-essential components in the human body, such as essential organs and non-essential body parts like hair and nails.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  Plants contain primary and secondary substances.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Insects have played a major role in the development of secondary substances in plants.
  Secondary substances can have roles in attracting pollinating insects, defending against plant-eating insects, or dissuading insects from feeding.
Thought:
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants is analogous to the relationship between necessary components and distinctive features in other systems.
  Choice B describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism:
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants is not exactly analogous to the relationship between necessary components and distinctive features in other systems.
  While the primary substances are necessary for growth and proper functioning, the secondary substances are not necessary for survival.
  The distinctive tastes and smells of plants are not merely aesthetic features, but have functional roles in attracting pollinating insects or defending against plant-eating insects.
  Therefore, while choice B is the most closely analogous, it is not a perfect analogy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:

Thought: 
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Therefore, the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to the relationship between automobiles and their mechanical components.
  Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  Primary substances are necessary for plants to grow and function properly; secondary substances give plants their distinctive taste and smell, but plants can survive without them.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances and the relationship between automobiles and their mechanical components is not perfect.
  While automobiles can run without features such as paint and taillights, those features can still serve important functions such as preventing rust and improving safety.
  In contrast, secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Therefore, another analogy may be more appropriate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:

  The analogy between plants and their primary and secondary substances and cars and their mechanical components and features is a reasonable one.
  However, there may be other analogies that could also work, such as the relationship between a human body and its essential organs versus other features such as hair and eye color.
  Nonetheless, B is still the best answer choice among those given.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Insects play a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today.
Thought:

  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Insects play a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today.
  Therefore, the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to the relationship between automobiles and their mechanical components such as engines and transmissions, which are necessary for automobiles to run, and features such as paint and taillights, which give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  The answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.

  While primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning of plants, engines and transmissions are not necessary for automobiles to run.
  Therefore, the answer is not B.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Some secondary substances attract pollinating insects to blossoms and signal the presence of nectar, while others provide biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects.
Thought: 
  Primary and secondary substances are both found in plants.
  Primary substances are essential, while secondary substances are not.
  Insects play a role in the development of secondary substances in plants.
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants is similar to the relationship between mechanical components and features in automobiles.
  Mechanical components are essential, while features such as paint and taillights are not.
  The answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between primary and secondary substances in plants and mechanical components and features in automobiles is not a perfect one.
  While both primary substances and mechanical components are essential, secondary substances and features are not.
  However, the analogy is the closest among the choices.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are diverse chemicals that give plants their distinctive smells and tastes.
  Insects play a major role in the development of secondary substances.
  Insects have evolved ways to circumvent the plants' defenses.
Thought: 
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are diverse chemicals that give plants their distinctive smells and tastes.
  Therefore, the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is similar to the relationship between automobiles and their mechanical components (such as engines and transmissions) and their features (such as paint and taillights).
  Mechanical components are necessary for automobiles to run, while features give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety.
  Similarly, primary substances are necessary for plants to grow and function, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive smells and tastes.
  Therefore, B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them is the best analogy.
Criticism: 
  The analogy between plants and their primary and secondary substances and automobiles and their mechanical components and features is not perfect.
  While both relationships involve essential and non-essential components, the role of secondary substances in plants is not purely aesthetic, as features are in automobiles.
  Additionally, the analogy does not account for the role of insects in the development of secondary substances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Secondary substances have arisen due to genetic mutations and have been conserved by natural selection.
  Insects have played a major role in the development of secondary substances in plants.
Thought: 
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to a relationship where one set of components is necessary for proper functioning and the other set of components provides a distinctive characteristic or function but is not necessary for proper functioning.
  A: Although generators are used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable, they are not a part of the essential components required for proper functioning, so this relationship is not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  B: This relationship is analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances. Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run, whereas features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: This relationship involves different components that are required for the operation of a factory, but they do not have the same characteristics as primary and secondary substances in plants, so this relationship is not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  D: This relationship involves different components that are required for the braking system of trains, but they do not have the same characteristics as primary and secondary substances in plants, so this relationship is not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  E: Although word processing programs are necessary for computers to function as word processors, they are not a part of the essential components required for proper functioning, so this relationship is not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Criticism: 
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to a relationship where one set of components is necessary for proper functioning and the other set of components provides a distinctive characteristic or function but is not necessary for proper functioning.
  Although some other options have a similar structure, they do not involve the same characteristics as primary and secondary substances in plants.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  D: Most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.

  Therefore, the statement that the "peers" would have been most likely to agree with is that "Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision."
  The answer is C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
Criticism: 
  You are correct that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would be social scientists who subscribed to the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  However, the passage does not suggest that the "peers" would have agreed with the statement that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  It is more accurate to say that the peers would have agreed with the view that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of a dance technique called dance-isolation, which originated in traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures.
  Dunham was an anthropologist who conducted research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time, as she participated in the dances herself.
  Dunham used her research-to-performance method to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that social scientists neglected dance as an area of social research because most of them were not trained in dance, and experts in dance were not trained in social research methods.
  The peers mentioned in line 22 would most likely agree that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment, which means that social scientists should not become too closely involved in the dances they are observing.
  Therefore, the statement that the peers mentioned in line 22 would most likely agree with is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not mention whether the peers mentioned in line 22 would agree or disagree with the statement in choice B.
  The passage only suggests that most social scientists neglected dance as an area of social research because they were not trained in dance, and experts in dance were not trained in social research methods.
  Therefore, it is possible that the peers mentioned in line 22 would disagree with choice B.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of the technique known as dance-isolation.
  Dunham was a pioneer in the field of dance ethnology.
  Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
Thought: 
  The peers mentioned in line 22 are social scientists who gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry.
  The passage suggests that dance had been neglected as an area of social research.
  Therefore, the peers would most likely agree with the statement that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  The answer is C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not explicitly state that the peers would agree with the statement that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  The passage states that most social scientists neglected dance as an area of social research, but it does not indicate that they believed research into dance could not be conducted with precision.
  Therefore, the answer may not be C.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the development of dance-isolation and Katherine Dunham's role in bringing traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into modern North American dance through her training in both anthropological research and choreography. 
  The passage also discusses the neglect of dance as an area of social research in the past, due to the lack of expertise in both dance and social research, and Dunham's approach to research, which diverged from the prevailing methodology at the time.
Thought: 
  The "peers" mentioned in line 22 are likely to be social scientists who would have agreed that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment, given the prevailing methodology at the time. 
  Therefore, the statement that they would have been most likely to agree with is one that supports this view.
  Choice B, which suggests that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them, contradicts this view.
  Choice C suggests that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision, which is not necessarily the view of the "peers" mentioned in the passage.
  Choice D suggests that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology, which is not supported by the passage.
  Choice E suggests that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection, which is not necessarily the view of the "peers" mentioned in the passage.
  Therefore, the best answer is A, which suggests that most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it, and is consistent with the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
Criticism: 
  None.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the history of Katherine Dunham's work in bringing traditional African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island dance techniques into modern North American dance.
  Dunham was trained in both anthropological research and choreography, and used her training to conduct research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time, which called for complete detachment from the subject being studied.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances and because they subscribed to the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  This suggests that Dunham's colleagues believed that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
Criticism: 
  While the passage does suggest that Dunham's colleagues believed in the need for detachment in research, it does not necessarily follow that they believed research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  It is possible that Dunham's colleagues subscribed to this view for other reasons.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's success in introducing traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into North American and European choreography.
  Dunham's success was due in part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  Dunham's research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture, were critical to her success.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time, in which effective data gathering was conducted from a position of complete detachment.
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that "peers" advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing and that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  This suggests that the "peers" would have been most likely to agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  Therefore, B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them is the best answer.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not suggest that the "peers" would have agreed with the statement in choice B.
  Instead, it suggests the opposite, that the "peers" subscribed to the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, and her success in bringing traditional dance techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance.
  Dunham was an anthropologist in the 1930s, and was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology.
  Dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry.
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dunham's peers in anthropology would have agreed with the statement that social scientists need to be detached from their subjects in order to obtain reliable data.
  Choice B suggests that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them, but this contradicts the passage's suggestion that Dunham's success was due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  Choice C suggests that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision, but this is not supported by the passage, which describes Dunham's research-to-performance method.
  Choice D suggests that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology, but this is not mentioned in the passage.
  Choice E suggests that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection, but this is not supported by the passage, which describes Dunham's success in adapting Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance.
Criticism: 
  The passage does not directly state what Dunham's peers in anthropology would have agreed with regarding the study of dance.
  Therefore, the correct answer may not be included among the choices.
